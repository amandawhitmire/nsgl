# The National Sea Grant Library has closed 

## Background
The National Sea Grant Library (NSGL), which was housed on the Bay Campus of the University of Rhode Island, is no longer being funded and the entire collection is being deaccessioned. The collection consists of 2 print copies of each title published by every state Sea Grant program going back to the 1970's.  Subject areas include research, trade and popular material on the scientific, economic, political and social aspects of the coastal zones of the U.S., including the Great Lakes. Many of these titles have only a handful of libraries holding them or the NSG library is the only library.

## Plan for the collection
NOAA Central Library is taking existing digital copies of titles into the NOAA IR, but the images are not up to current standards. It is not clear how much of the collection has been scanned. 

There are 2 copies of each print title. As of now, Internet Archive will be taking the archival copy of the entire colelction. The circulating copies have been offered in batches by state to any library willing to tkae them. Because of space limitations, URI will only be retaining the Rhode Island Sea Grant material. If no home is found for the 2nd copy of the items, they will go to the trash. 

The Harold A. Miller Library will take the entire California Sea Grant Collection. According to the [National Sea Grant Catalog](https://eos.ucs.uri.edu/EOSWebOPAC/OPAC/Index.aspx), there are 6,109 CA items, or about 40 shelf feet according to the retiring NSGL Librarian. The librarian was unable to retrieve catalog records from the Very Old online catalog, so this GH Repo is for code related to scraping the NSGL online catalog and processing the records.
