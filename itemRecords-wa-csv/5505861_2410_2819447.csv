12,Abstract:,"A symposium on economically important plants of the Atlantic was attended by academic, government and industry representatives from Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Washington, D.C., the Canadian Maritime Provinces, and the U.K. The experts that were gathered presented their latest research endeavors to an audience interested in recent advances in marine plant aquaculture. Among the presentations were an overview of ecophysiologica​l studies for tropical seaweed aquaculture, recent advances in the genetics of commercially important seaweeds, developments in protoplast fusion and somatic cell hybridization, the role of physiological studies in the development of commercially viable aquaculture systems, management considerations for harvesting of natural seaweed beds, and the future of marine plant aquaculture and utilization in the North Atlantic."
