12,Abstract:,"During 1992-94 Sea Grant and extension personnel and their supporting graduate students helped two small coastal cities in the Pacific Northwest develop and begin to implement waterfront revitalization plans. Community planning teams in Raymond, Washington and Warrenton, Oregon, appointed jointly by their respective municipal and local port district officials, made the commitment to test the proposition that small communities can, with very limited technical assistance, develop and begin to implement well thought-out, community-based plans that expand local economies and improve quality of life. The planning process they followed is described in ""Waterfront Revitalization for Small Cities"", a planning guide written in 1990 by the two principal investigators. The experience gained from this national demonstration project is evaluated using standard policy assessment and educational program evaluation techniques. This report concludes that the planning approach was fundamentally sound, providing a useful community-based planning framework and detailed substantive guidance for waterfront planning teams. The approach has some limitations, however, when applied to very small, understaffed cities."
