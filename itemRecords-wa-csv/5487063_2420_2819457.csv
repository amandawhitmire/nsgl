13,Abstract:,"An array of natural and synthetic fiber types were converted into sheath-core bicomponent fibers by coating with chitosan applied in or from solution. The coatings were characterized on the fibers by scanning electron microscopy or, after the formation of colored derivatives, by photomicrograph​y. The most uniform and adherent chitosan sheaths were formed on core fibers possessing hydroxylic or anionic surfaces. The resultant bicomponent fibers present chemically reactive chitosan in the form of a mechanically strong solid of large surface area. The cost-​performance and the potential utility of the marine polysaccharide should thereby be greatly extended."
