10,Abstract:,"In 2017, the Gulf Research Program (GRP) and the Health and Medical Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) hosted a workshop entitled “Preparing for a Rapid Response to Major Marine Oil Spills: Protecting and Assessing the Health and Well-Being of Communities."" The workshop examined essential research opportunities for improving public health preparedness, response, and protection associated with oil spills; reflected on ways to work within and complement the conventional framework for oil spill response, to promote community health and well-being; and encouraged connections between public health workers, oil spill practitioners, disaster researchers, and leaders from affected communities (Giammaria, Nicholson, & Snair, 2018; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). Workshop attendees identified potential challenges and opportunities for communities to support preparedness and resiliency after a spill and encouraged the GRP to convene similar meetings to gather input at the local level."
