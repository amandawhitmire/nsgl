14,Abstract:,"'Nuclear Inclusion X (NIX)' is an obligate intranuclear pathogen which has been associated with severe mortality of the Pacific razor clam, ""Siliqua patula"". Procedures have been developed to isolate the organism, and purify its RNA. A partial sequence (692 bases) was determined by directly sequencing the 16S rRNA using a modified Sanger dideoxy chain termination method. Analysis of the sequence data indicated that the NIX organism is a member of the gamma subclass of the eubacterial class ""Proteobacteria​"". Comparison of the NIX sequence with those of over 100 gamma proteobacteria revealed no closely related organsisms. NIX probably represents a novel genus."
