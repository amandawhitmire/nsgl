11,Abstract:,"Effects of temperature on zoeal development of ""Cancer productus"", ""C. oregonensis"", and ""C. gracilis"" collected from Puget Sound, Washington, USA, were determined and compared with published data on ""C. magister"". Survival through zoeal development, mortality per individual zoeal instar, instar duration, and megalopa weight were determined for zoeae of each species raised in the laboratory at 10, 15, and 20 deg. C. Results are compared among the four species to determine whether differences occur in response to temperature and whether there is a relationship between such response and female body size."
