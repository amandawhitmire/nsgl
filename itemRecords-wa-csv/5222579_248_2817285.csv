10,Abstract:,"In the conflicts relative to Guemes Island (Smith vs. Skagit) and to Port Susan (Chrobuck vs. Snohomish County), the representations to the State Supreme Court were based on the individual parties involved. In reality, however, the incidence of costs and benefits accruing from such industrial development, or from the decision not to develop, is more widespread than court procedure suggests. The decision-making process involved in the two conflicts can be viewed in many ways. This paper is an attempt to look at the decisions arrived at in the two cases in terms of the costs and benefits relevant to the interest groups involved. The use of benefit-cost measures implies the existence of adequate data to study the impacts of the developments. Since such data rarely exist, and certainly do not exist in the case of Guemes Island and Port Susan, an attempt will be made to show how ""going through the motions"" of a benefit-cost analysis not only outlines and clarifies certain conceptual and practical problems involved but can also suggest the direction which policy should take."
