10,Abstract:,"This report examines the economic costs of the Snake River Salmon Recovery Team's final recommendations to the National Marine Fisheries Service. These recommendations concern three Snake River salmon stocks listed under the endangered Species Act (ESA): sockeye salmon (""Oncorhynchus nerka""), spring and summer chinook salmon (""O. tshawytscha""), and fall chinook salmon. The Recovery Team's recommendations are comprehensive in addressing every stage in the salmon's life history. The recommended measures deal with present conditions and historic causes of salmon population decline, including hydropower dam operations, water appropriations for irrigation, overfishing, habitat destruction, hatchery practices, land use and other factors. To achieve recovery to the point of delisting, the Recovery Team seeks improvement in survival in every life stage of the listed species."
