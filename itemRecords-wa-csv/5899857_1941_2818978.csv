13,Abstract:,"As a natural biological polymer, chitosan is capable of signaling the activation of plant pathogenesis-​related (PR) genes (those involved in disease resistance). In this work, researchers developed vector constructs that incorporate PR gene promoters along with the DNase gene so that plants can be transformed with the DNase gene and activated by either chitosan or a plant pathogenic fungus which, in turn, will activate the synthesis of the entire set of PR genes and thus hypothetically promote disease resistance."
