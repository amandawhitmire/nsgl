11,Abstract:,"The purpose of this case study is to describe the ""Infrastructure and Dredging Cost Estimate Matrix Tool"" (The Matrix) and the general process by which a community would valuate its navigational and port infrastructure. With some basic training, port authorities and others on the Great Lakes can use The Matrix to estimate the costs of repair and/or replacement or dredging for most port infrastructure. Maintenance costs for these assets are then extrapolated in relation to changing water levels and projected storm conditions due to climate variation in order to determine the associated economic risk. (Clark and Bergeron, 2010; Bergeron and Clark, 2010). For the purpose of this case study, the Port of Toledo will be analyzed using The Matrix in order to demonstrate how the tool is used in practice. The port lies at the mouth of the Maumee River in northwestern Ohio, at the southwestern tip of Lake Erie. The City of Toledo is the seat of Lucas County, Ohio and its metropolitan area is home to over half a million people. The Port of Toledo handles over 12 million tons of cargo and 700 vessel calls annually, while its shipyard is one of the only full service shipyards on the U.S. side of the lower lakes with graving or ""dry"" docks."
