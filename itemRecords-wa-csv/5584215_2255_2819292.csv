12,Abstract:,"Early work on chlorophytic (chlorophyll a,b-containing) plant systems established the precedent that the many circular molecules of a chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) population were homogeneous with respect to size and gene complement. In this study, field inverted gel electrophoresis and hybridization analysis have been used to verify a chloroplast origin for at least two differently sized ""Monodus"" sp. cpDNA molecules."
