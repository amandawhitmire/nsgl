13,Abstract:,"The Nature Conservancy of Washington, with support from the Natural Capital Project, is mapping the vulnerability of coastal and marine shorelines in Pacific County to coastal hazards. Specifically, we are investigating where habitats such as seagrasses, dunes, and shellfish reefs buffer shorelines from storm-induced erosion and inundation. The intent is to provide a clearer understanding of where in Willapa Bay and along the outer coast specific habitats provide the most protection, so that adaptation, protection and restoration efforts can be designed with this information in hand. We have undertaken this effort to provide information for use in the County’s Shoreline Master Plan (SMP) update currently underway. We highlight the methodology used here, initial results and discuss how results can be used in the SMP update. The final set of results will be completed this summer and made readily available to interested parties in the online viewer1 that we have generated for this region, as static maps, and/or as files for use in a GIS."
