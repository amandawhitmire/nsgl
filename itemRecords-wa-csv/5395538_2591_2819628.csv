9,Abstract:,"This project originated from observations of hatchery-reared smolts in which fish in apparently good health after 20-30 h in seawater had plasma Mg levels which we would have expected to be toxic. The objective of this project was to test whether the high level of plasma Mg found in hatchery smolts after transfer into seawater was not harmful because of Mg binding to plasma proteins in a way not found in wild smolts. It was found that the proportion of plasma Mg bound to plasma protein did not change significantly during entry into seawater, even though the in vitro addition of exogenous Mg to the plasma showed that additional binding was possible."
