10,Abstract:,"""Amphiascoides atopus,"" a new species, is described from a mass culture system. Its natural habitats and distribution are unknown. Approximately 300,000 individuals have been harvested from a 2.5 square meter culture surface area almost every day for more than six months, with no sign of population decline. Specimens used to start this culture were obtained from a commercial bioassay laboratory, where it was identified as a fouling species in culture tanks of marine fish and invertebrates."
