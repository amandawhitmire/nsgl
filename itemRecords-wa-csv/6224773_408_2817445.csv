14,Abstract:,"A critical first step in guiding protection efforts for marine birds is comprehensive evaluation of monitoring results. In a preliminary study designed to facilitate such a synthesis in Puget Sound, Washington, we identified five survey programs that spanned large fractions of this region during 1966-2007. We focused this initial review on Padilla Bay, one of the sites most heavily used by wintering and migrating birds on the Pacific Coast. Comparison for September to mid-May of Marine Ecosystems Analysis and Western Washington University shore- based surveys, two survey programs that used highly comparable methods, suggests that the combined density of all marine birds in Padilla Bay declined between 1978/79 and 2003-2006. These overall declines occurred mainly during early winter (November) and especially during spring migration (mid-March to mid-May). During spring migration, species assemblages were highly dissimilar between 1978/79 and 2003-2006. Of 27 species and species groups we considered, six increased and 13 declined. These declines occurred across foraging guilds and were large for many formerly abundant species. For example, typical maximum densities declined by about 75% (400/km2 to 100/km2) for Brant Branta bernicla, 80% (75/km2 to 15/km2) for scaup (mainly Greater Scaup Aythya marila) and 98% (>50/km2 to <1/km2) for Western Grebes Aechmophorus occidentalis. Results of aerial surveys during 1992-2007 by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife were consistent with most of the identified changes. Causes of decline are unclear for most species, but appear to be widespread. Padilla Bay habitats and the many thousands of birds that depend on them face multiple threats."
