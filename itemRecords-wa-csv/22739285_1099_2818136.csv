17,Abstract:,"Across much of the ocean's surface wind actively mixes a thin layer of water. This mixing results in constituents like temperature and salinity being evenly distributed within this layer. The factors that contribute to the characteristics of that mixed layer (e.g. wind and solar irradiance) vary in location and time, especially over seasons, leading to variations in space and time in the depth of that well mixed layer. This data lab will allow students to examine real data from two locations in the ocean to study these interacting processes, and how they influence the depth and characteristics of the mixed layer. This exercise is designed to facilitate learning about surface mixing in the ocean. Pieces of the exercise can be used as appropriate for the instructor goals. The collection consists of 3 sets of activities. Part One is focused on data exploration activities, to be used during the Exploration phase of the Learning Cycle. Part Two is focused on the Concept Invention phase of the Learning Cycle. Part Three is focused on the Application phase of the Learning Cycle. These activities were developed to assist with students' understanding of mixed layer dynamics, in part because surface ocean dynamics are foundational in Oceanography and cut across numerous Ocean Literacy principles, and also because wind-driven surface mixing in particular is widespread, easily observed in a variety of systems and with tractable dynamics that make it suitable for introductory oceanography instruction. Grade level: Undergraduate students in Introduction to Oceanography courses (for either marine science majors or non-science majors). Could be extended for upper level students."
