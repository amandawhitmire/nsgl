13,Abstract:,Studies of failures of mooring systems in Hurricanes Gloria (1987) and Bob (1992) made it painfully obvious that very little is known about the forces on a mooring caused by a sailboat subjected to wind and waves. This paper describes a system for measuring actual forces on a mooring caused by a sailboat while simultaneously measuring some significant environmental variables. Preliminary data give good insights into the range of forces involved and the system dynamics.
