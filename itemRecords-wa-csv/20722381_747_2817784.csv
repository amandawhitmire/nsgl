8,Abstract:,"This guidebook is about alternatives to the use of bulkheads and other shoreline armoring. Hard engineering is currently the standard approach for erosion control around the lake, but it has several negative impacts on nearshore habitats as well as the fi sh and wildlife that depend on them. More sustainable practices, referred to in this guidebook as green shorelines, use plants, beaches, and other natural materials to protect private property and the environment."
