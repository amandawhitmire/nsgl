11,Abstract:,"This paper reports the execution of an important step in the development of concurrent mapping and localization (CML): a CML algorithm for use by multiple collaborating autonomous vehicles. Sharing and combining observations of environmental features as well as of the collaborating vehicles can greatly enhance the performance of CML. This work demonstrates its feasibility and benefits by quantifying the improvement in CML performance achieved by collaboration, and comparing collaborative versus single- vehicle CML results in simulation."
