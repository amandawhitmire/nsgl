10,,Radar is an electronic navigation aid used for determining the distance and direction of objects in the vicinity of a vessel. It provides the user with bearing and distance information about targets that reflect the radio-frequency energy back to the radar unit. This publication describes the major components (and their functions) of radar systems and provides a brief guide to basic troubleshooting for a faulty system. What to look for when choosing a radar is also discussed.
