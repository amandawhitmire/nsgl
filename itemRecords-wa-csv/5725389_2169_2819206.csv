12,Abstract:,"The objectives of this study were two-fold: (1) to describe and compare the life-history characteristics (growth, reproduction, and larval settlement) of ""Neotrypaea"" and ""Upogebia"" in Willapa Bay, the largest and most important estuary for oyster-culture operations in the Pacific Northwest; and (2) to identify characteristics that should be considered in design and implementation of programs to control shrimp on intertidal culture grounds."
