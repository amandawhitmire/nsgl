13,Abstract:,"Results from 3 yrs of hydrographic time series are shown for Willapa Bay, Washington, a macrotidal, partially mixed estuary whose river and ocean end members are both highly variable. Fluctuating ocean conditions-​-​alternations between wind-driven upwelling and downwelling, and intrusions of the buoyant Columbia River plume--are shown to force order-​of-​magnitude changes in salinity gradients on the event (2-10 day) scale. An effective horizontal diffusivity parameterizing all up-estuary salt flux is calculated as a function of riverflow: results show that Willapa's volume-​integrated salt balance is almost always far from equilibrium. At very high riverflows (the top 15% of observations) the estuary loses salt, on average; while at all other riverflow levels it gains salt. Under summer, low-riverflow conditions, in fact, the effective diffusivity K is large enough to drive a net increase in salinity that is 3-6 times the seaward, river- driven salt flux. This diffusion process is amplified, not damped, by increased tidal forcing, contrary to the expectation for baroclinic exchange. Furthermore, K varies along the length of the estuary as approximately 5% of the rms tidal velocity times channel width, a scaling consistent with density-​dependent stirring by tidal residuals. To summarize Willapa's event--and seasonal-- scale variability, a simple diagnostic parameter space for unsteady estuarine salt balances is presented, a generalization from the Hansen and Rattray steady-state scheme."
