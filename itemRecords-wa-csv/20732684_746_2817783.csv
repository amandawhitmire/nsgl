8,Abstract:,"The community of North Cove, Washington, is located on Cape Shoalwater, a spit of land that is more commonly known by its more descriptive nickname: ""Washaway Beach."" Strong tides, storms and manmade development have all contributed to North Cove’s rapid erosion. On average, more than 100 feet of beach per year has disappeared into the ocean since the early 1900s, making Cape Shoalwater the fastest eroding landscape on the West Coast."
