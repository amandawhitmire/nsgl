8,Abstract:,"Data are being gathered by state and federal agencies to provide understanding on how many Americans participate in fishing, their socio-economic description, their activity patterns, their catch, and their fishing-related expenditures. We may argue with the scope, design, and/or findings from these studies, nevertheless we are developing some rudimentary information to present in behalf of fishing, anglers, and fisheries and their management. These data, when expressed in economic terms to establish primary and secondary benefits, are essential to decision making and allocation decisions. In this regard, resource economics, like the law, is becoming increasingly important to the fishery manager. The economic aspects of optimum sustainable yield (OSY) management have been previously dealt with by many more competent than I. Therefore, while this paper will not ignore the economic aspects of fisheries management, it will focus on the human and social aspects of fishing benefits: their definition, identification, measurement, and consideration in managerial policy and decision making."
