8,Abstract:,"Since its beginning, the Pacific coast oyster industry has endured many ups and downs, but it has perserved and slowly evolved into the most sophisticated oyster industry in the world. Currently, the industry is based on farming the Pacific oyster, ""Crassostrea gigas"". It essentially involves the production of seed, grow-out by any of several methods, and then harvesting, processing, and market/distribuâ€‹tion. Pacific oyster production represents approximately 99% of total production. The underlying factors responsible for sustaining this aquaculture industry for over seven decades are explored."
