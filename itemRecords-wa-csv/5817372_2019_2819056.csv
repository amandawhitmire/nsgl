12,Abstract:,"""Spartina anglica,"" English cordgrass, has spread through marshes in England, Europe, New Zealand, Australia, China and North America. The threat to native species and to the physical structure of estuaries caused by introduced cordgrasses has led to many attempts to control these invaders by digging, diking and flooding, crushing, burning, grazing, mowing, covering, and herbicide application. The authors of this paper found that a population of this estuarine plant, introduced to Puget Sound, Washington, was highly vulnerable to ""Prokelisia"" spp. planthoppers from California. More tha 90% of plants died in greenhouse culture with high planthopper densities, while <1% died at the very low hopper densities of the control. If intolerance to ""Prokelisia"" spp. in the field correlates with that in the greenhouse, biological control by this planthopper could contribute to management of cordgrass populations sensitive to this insect."
