14,Abstract:,"Puget Sound rockfish, ""Sebastes emphaeus"", is one of the most common rockfish in the rocky nearshore region of the Strait of Georgia, yet relatively little is known about its early life history, ecology, recruitment, and reproductive biology. The goals of this study were to delineate the spawning season and to determine the age and length at first maturity, the growth and mortality rates, and the length-â€‹fecundity relation for Puget Sound rockfish."
