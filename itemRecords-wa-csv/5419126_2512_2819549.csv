8,Abstract:,"Coastal environmental quality is determined on the basis of a relatively small number of biochemical and physical parameters which may bear little relation to the intended use of the water. This paper reports on the perceptions of five Narragansett Bay user groups (boaters, beachgoers, residents, tourists and shellfishermen) pertaining to both the dry shore and nearshore of Narragansett Bay. None of the environmental factors mentioned by users included those which traditionally have been used to measure the quality of the dry shore and nearshore. The paper concludes with a call for the inclusion of parameters important to the users in the determination of water classes and standards above and beyond the conventional biochemical and physical parameters collected at present."
