12,Abstract:,"In the 1980s threats to some areas of Puget Sound by nonpoint source pollution became a serious water quality issue. In response, the governance of this water quality problem went through a rapid evolution. Advances have been made by both the establishment of new agencies and through increased coordination by state agencies, local governments, and individuals. However, a lack of 'fiscal equivalence' has been and continues to be a significant impediment to continued success. This paper analyzes the evolution of the governance arrangements in Puget Sound."
