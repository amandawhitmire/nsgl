15,Abstract:,"We are studying relationships between ocean chemistry and zooplankton distributions in Puget Sound, Washington as a model of future coastal ocean ecosystems. Puget Sound is a deep fjord that connects to the North Pacific between the U.S. and Canada through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Hypoxia (<2 mg DO l-1) and extremely low pH (<7.5) occur naturally in Puget Sound as a result of inputs of upwelled ocean water, high surface production, and restricted circulation; anthropogenic eutrophication and global climate change are increasing the severity of conditions. In Summer and late Autumn, when the seasonally lowest oxygen and pH occur, conditions are particularly stressful for many organisms, yet abundant zooplankton and fish inhabit the region. How these organisms tolerate the conditions and whether their behavior, growth, taxonomic composition, and energy flow through trophic webs are altered is a focus of our research. Here we will examine shifts in zooplankton community structure and vertical distributions in relation to oxygen and pH in the field as well as results from laboratory experiments on changes in growth and survival to begin to understand how the interacting stressors affect marine ecosystems through direct and indirect effects. Because oxygen and pH are predicted to decline throughout the North Pacific, understanding controls on zooplankton will be necessary to predict future fisheries and ecosystem status."
