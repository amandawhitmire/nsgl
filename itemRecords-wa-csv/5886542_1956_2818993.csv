13,Abstract:,Progress toward assessing the impacts of contaminants in the marine environment will require a more complete understanding of the interactions of these chemicals with biological systems. A mechanistic understanding will stimulate the development of tools for monitoring marine organisms for exposure to and effects of chemical contaminants. Such tools and knowledge will facilitate the prediction of chemical effects (including identification of the most sensitive components of the ecosystem) and the consequences of remediation efforts. The authors of this paper describe some of the molecular biotechnologicaâ€‹l approaches that will further these objectives. They use examples drawn from research on halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons.
