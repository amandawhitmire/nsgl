13,Abstract:,"The Puget Sound mode, which provided the basis for the charts presented in this atlas, was constructed in 1950 in the Department of Oceanography at the University of Washington. The model's primary function was to provide a bird's eye view of circulation that could not be obtained readily from field observations a one. Beyond its role in basic research, the model has served as a teaching aid and in studies of tides and tidal currents, and in applied research relevant to pollution at various locations. The model has also been a prime attraction at departmental open houses where frequent winners of boat races in the Sound are numbered among its keenest observers. John Lincoln, who took the original photographs as a part of a recent research project, and Noel McGary, who prepared the charts from these photographs, collaborated in the preparation of this atlas. John was involved in the design, construction, and instrumentation​ of the model and has operated it over many years for a wide variety of studies. Noel, a longtime cartographer for the Department of Oceanography, has made notable contributions to portrayal of bathymetry and water properties of Puget Sound and the North Pacific. In preparing the various charts, the authors have keyed them to a single reference, the tide stage at Seattle, rather than the tidal currents, as is the case of the conventional current charts, which in the Sound are referenced to two locations of differing flow characteristics​. This enables the user to relate the charts to changes in water level easily observable along shore, or to the widely distributed tide tables or tide calendars. It also provides a more comprehensive picture of the system as a whole. This atlas should be of interest and value to boaters, fishermen, and recreationists, as well as to engineers and scientists concerned with surface currents in Puget Sound. Foreword is by Professor Emeritus: Clifford A. Barnes."
