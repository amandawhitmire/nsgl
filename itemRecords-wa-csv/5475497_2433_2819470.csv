10,Abstract:,"Chitinases and b-​1,3-​glucanases are prominent among the stress-induced proteins in pea pods. Of the five major basic proteins that accumulate in response to pathogen attack, two are chitinases and two are B-​1,3-​glucanases. A purification scheme is presented for all major isozymes and their differential regulation during development and in response to several stresses such as wounding, pathogen attack, and treatment with chitosan or ethylene are described. Direct evidence has been obtained for the antifungal activity of combinations of purified chitinase and beta-​1,3-​glucanase."
