15,Abstract:,"Accurate and timely documentation of coastal wetland gains and losses is critical to their conservation and effective management. To fulfill this need, NOAA conceived of the CoastWatch Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) which will utilize remote sensing technology to monitor changes in coastal wetland habitats and adjacent uplands on a cycle of 1-5 years. Appropriate procedures must be established before C-CAP can become an operational program producing a comprehensive nationally standardized database on coastal habitat change. To achieve this, NOAA sponsored a series of workshops focused on developing regional operational protocols applicable to coastal uplands as well as wetlands. The objective of this research was to evaluate several of these protocols by applying them to a coastal study site in South Carolina. This paper reports on the identification of the optimum change detection logic to be used and preliminary findings concerning the influence of tides on coastal classification and change detection using remote sensor data."
