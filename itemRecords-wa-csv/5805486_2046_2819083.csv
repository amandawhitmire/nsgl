11,Abstract:,"This review covers the literature published on the biosynthesis of marine microbial and macroalgal natural products over a 10-year period from 1989 through 1998. Topics include dinoflagellate and algal sterol side chains, algal oxylipins, microalgal metabolites and current knowledge on the involvement of invertebrate-â€‹hosted microorganisms in natural product biosynthesis through cellular localization studies."
