11,Abstract:,"The regulatory role of chitosan in eucaryotic organisms may have far reaching consequences because chitosan and its acetylated form, chitin, are prevalent in nature. Two different regulatory functions for chitosan in a simple fungal-plant interaction were found. Chitosan, a normal component of the cell walls of some fungi, can activate specific genes in plants and at similar concentrations can completely inhibit all RNA synthesis in some fungal organisms and thus suppress gene activity. In this paper data which partially explain this paradoxical action is reviewed."
