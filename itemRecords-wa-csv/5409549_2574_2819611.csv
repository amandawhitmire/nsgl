8,Abstract:,"Chitin--the biopolymer that, among other things, forms the exoskeleton of insects and crustaceans--is the second most abundant polymer occurring in nature, after cellulose, with some 1600 metric tons produced annually. The Japanese process 300 tons of chitin a year into a commercial product that is used mostly as a coagulant for water purification or for treating food-processing wastes. However, in the U.S. and elsewhere, chitin is, instead, a substantial waste problem for the shrimp- and crab-processing industries. Chitin has many interesting prospects for valuable products, ranging from surgical sutures to contact lenses; however, there are many hurdles to be overcome before it can become an important commercial product in the U.S. Some of the prospects and hurdles are outlined here."
