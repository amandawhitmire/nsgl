7,Abstract:,"Since 1979, the National Sea Grant College Program has administered one of the nation’s most prestigious marine policy fellowship programs. The Knauss fellowship provides a unique educational and professional experience to graduate students who have an interest in ocean, coastal and Great Lakes resources and policy decisions affecting those resources. The Knauss Fellowship offers direct experience working on the latest issues in ocean, coastal and Great Lakes management and research. This factsheet also provides metrics on the approximate number of offices in the Washington D.C. area that have hosted fellows in the last four years."
