9,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to promote desorption, degradation and switching of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to powdered activated carbon, thus decreasing the bioaccessibilit​y of PAHs (i.e., naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene) in three creosote contaminated sediments (Little Scioto, Ohio (LS); Gary, Indiana (GI) and Eagle Harbor, Washington (EH)) using sonication. Firstly, the ability of sonication to degrade these PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene) in aqueous solution was investigated. Pyrene had the fastest sonolytic degradation rate compared to naphthalene and phenanthrene, a trend opposite to Henry's law and diffusion coefficients for these three compounds. Based on the degradation trend, pyrene appeared to accumulate to a greater extent at the gas/solution interface of the cavitation bubbles compared to naphthalene and phenanthrene. Once on the interface, pyrene reacts more efficiently with OH radicals compared to reactions in bulk solution, which is dependent on the diffusion of OH radicals from cavitation bubbles to bulk solution. Decreased formation of hydroxyterephth​alate, a measure of bulk solution OH radical, during sonolysis in the presence of pyrene but not in the presence of naphthalene or phenanthrene was consistent with pyrene accumulation on cavitation bubble interfaces. In addition, increased bulk solution temperature and naphthalene solution concentration increased the degradation rates of naphthalene. These two operating parameters increased the amount of naphthalene diffusing into cavitation bubbles available for pyrolysis. Finally, sonolytic degradation rate constants with 0.5 μM each of these PAHs in a mixture were lower compared to sonolysis of aqueous solutions containing these compounds individually. Naphthalene and phenanthrene, which diffused faster than pyrene, inhibited the accumulation of pyrene at the interface. Conversely, pyrene on cavitation bubble interfaces reacted with interfacial OH decreasing [OH] in bulk solution available for reaction with naphthalene and phenanthrene. Secondly, the application of ultrasound for remediation of PAHs in freshwater sediments was examined with the aim of exploiting the ability of ultrasound to promote desorption of contaminants from sediments for sonolytic degradation and understanding the effect of sonolysis on bioaccessibilit​y of the sediment. After 60 min sonolysis of 12.5 g L-1 of natural sediment suspended in MilliQ water, the combined solution and sediment concentrations of naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene extracted were reduced by 23 %, 15 %, and 23 %, respectively. This reduction in concentration is a result of sonodegradation and/or occlusion of PAHs into the particles. Decrease in solid-liquid ratio below 12.5 g L-1 resulted in reduction in the rate of sonodegradation and/or occlusion of the PAHs due to low particle concentration resulting in decrease particle-​particle collisions and microjets formation which facilitated mass transfer of PAHs desorption. An increase in the solid-liquid ratio above 12.5 g L-1 resulted in a decrease in the rates of sonodegradation and/or occlusion of the PAHs. This decrease was attributed to reduced ultrasonic intensity as a result of sound attenuation in the presence of excess sediment particles and/or limitations in the solubility of PAHs. In addition to sonodegradation​, the fast desorbing fraction of pyrene, which has been related to bioaccessibilit​y, was found to increase with sonication time of 20min followed by a plateau of a slight decrease at 120 min. Sonolysis of particles facilitated the desorption of PAHs through localized turbulent liquid movement, microjets formation and particles fragmentation, exposing new surfaces to the aqueous phase, thus decreasing the slow fraction of Phenanthrene and pyrene. This result suggested that ultrasound irradiation of natural sediment can release the PAHs on the slow desorbing sites. Although PAHs on these slow sites are less accessible, they are potential source for PAHs release and are difficult to treat using bioremediation due to limitation on their desorption rates. Thus the potential of decreasing these fractions using sonolysis is important. Lastly, the use of powdered activated carbon (PAC) amendment and sonication was employed to reduce the bioaccessibilit​y of PAHs in these three creosote contaminated sediments. For these three sediments, sonochemically induced switching of phenanthrene and pyrene from sediment to PAC was more effective than mechanical mixing in decreasing the fast desorbing fraction (FFast) (i.e., % reduction in FFast; ultrasound: EH= 91 � 3 %, GI = 67 � 3 %, and LS = 67 � 3 %, mixing: EH= 81 � 3 %, GI = 42 � 3 %, and LS = 53 � 3 %). The enhancement effect observed for sediment treated with sonication was attributed to the facilitation of desorption of PAHs through localized turbulent liquid movement, microjets formation and particles fragmentation, exposing new surfaces to the aqueous phase."
