16,,"The purpose of the National CZM Effectiveness Study was to determine the effectiveness of the CZM program (as developed and implemented by the various states) in addressing core objectives of the CZMA. The project was designed to document the management tools and on-the-ground results of state CZM programs in addressing the national objectives of the CZMA. These objectives include: (1) protection of natural resources; (2) provision of public access to the coast; and (3) promotion of water-dependent uses. The study sought to recommend ways to improve the national program. In addition to an Executive Summary, two other reports were to be produced. One report would provide a national summary of overall effectiveness of the CZM program based on cross-state aggregation and comparison. The other would contain stat-by-state survey profiles documenting management tools (process indicators) and on- the-ground results (outcome indicators)."
