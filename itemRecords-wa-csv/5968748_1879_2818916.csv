13,Abstract:,"The Salmon River estuary, Oregon, offers a unique opportunity to simultaneously evaluate several estuarine restoration projects and the response of the marsh community while making comparisons with a concurring undiked portion of the estuary. Dikes installed in three locations in the estuary during the early 1960s were removed in 1978, 1987, and 1996, creating a 'space-for-time substitution' chronosequence. The development states of the three recovering marshes helped researchers determine a trajectory of estuarine recovery over 23 years and to make comparisons with the reference marsh. Here they assess the rate and pattern of juvenile salmon habitat development in terms of fish density, available prey resources, and diet composition of wild juvenile ""Oncorhynchus tshawytscha"" (chinook salmon)."
