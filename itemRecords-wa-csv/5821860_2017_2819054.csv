9,Abstract:,"Cannibalism, or other processes that may have evolved in response to cannibalism, may be important factors regulating crab recruitment in natural populations and limiting crab production in artificial habitats. The objectives of this study were to examine experimentally whether: (1) cannibalism rate by age classes 0+, 1+ and 2+ of Dungeness crabs ""Cancer magister"" of both sexes on YOY conspecifics is affected by habitat type; (2) cannibalism rate among YOY is affected by conspecific density and prey- predator asymmetry; and (3) YOY mutual interference and prey-predator asymmetry affect consumption rate."
