11,Abstract:,"The echo integrator is a sonic device that enables the fishery researcher to quantify fish stocks more accurately than he has been able to do by the use of test fishing and/or an unmodified echo sounder. In this report the fundamentals of underwater acoustics are discussed, the echo integrator is described, and its operation and performance in field experiments by Mr. Richard Thorne of the College of Fisheries, University of Washington, are treated. This paper was originally a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science, University of Washington, Seattle. The design, testing, and use of the echo integrator was an interdisciplina​ry research project under the sponsorship of the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Fisheries Research Institute, College of Fisheries, at the University of Washington."
