10,Abstract:,"Although dam removal and fish passage projects offer extraordinary potential to conserve threatened Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and other migratory fishes, only rarely has the biological response to these restoration activities been evaluated. Modification of Landsburg Diversion Dam on the Cedar River, WA, USA in fall 2003 provided a unique opportunity to investigate the process of colonization as coho (O. kisutch) and Chinook (O. tshawytscha) salmon were granted access to over 33 km of spawning and rearing habitat. Adult salmon were sampled as they bypassed the dam, and total counts of both species tended to increase from 2003 to 2009, although more rapidly for coho salmon. DNA-based parentage identified salmon from the second generation of colonization as recruits if they were produced above the dam or ""strays"" if they were produced elsewhere. In 2008 and 2009, coho salmon recruits vastly outnumbered the strays, but strays were more abundant than recruits for Chinook salmon. Chinook salmon strays included a much larger proportion of hatchery origin salmon than coho salmon, despite the absence of any hatchery on the Cedar River for either species. Productivity, calculated as the ratio of recruits sampled at the dam to spawners, exceeded replacement in all four coho salmon cohorts but only one of three Chinook salmon cohorts. Parentage analysis was also used to investigate individual reproductive success and the traits of the most successful salmon. Reproductive success of male hatchery Chinook salmon was 70 ? 90 % that of natural origin fish across three cohorts, but there was no consistent trend for the females. In both sexes of coho salmon, larger fish produced more adult offspring for each of three cohorts, and early breeders produced more offspring in 2003, but not in 2004 and 2005 when fish spawning during the middle of the season were favored. In addition, there was evidence for widespread dispersal within the new habitat by stream-rearing juvenile coho salmon, most notably immigration into a tributary of the Cedar River. Overall, these results demonstrated that reconnecting previously isolated habitats is an effective conservation strategy for Pacific salmon."
