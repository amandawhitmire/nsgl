9,Abstract:,"Whether you are a waterfront homeowner, contractor or jurisdiction, this program provides you with the tools you need to enjoy the many recreational, scenic, environmental, and shoreline protection benefits of preserved or restored shorelines. GSH is a voluntary, incentive-based program similar to green building rating programs such as Built Green™ and LEED™. A residential shoreline project receives points for design features from four categories of credits."
