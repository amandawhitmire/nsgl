10,Abstract:,"In our attempts to share environmental information, we have become over-reliant on TV news segments, magazine features, Web pages and four-color brochures. Each of these oft-employed venues can have genuine benefits but they can also have serious drawbacks, including high costs, for individuals and organizations eager to spread the word with the public at large. In our efforts to keep pace with the latest developments in social media, we tend to overlook equally effective approaches that are often inexpensive and easy to mount. Drawing on his 25 years of experience as a professional communicator, Washington Sea Grant Science Writer David G Gordon has worked in the past on several public-â€‹awareness campaigns that, while produced on shoestring budgets, have reached thousands of people throughout the Pacific Northwest. In this context, he will describe his latest project - creating and placing water quality information on milk carton panels - and suggest strategies with which others can get more bang for their limited communication bucks."
