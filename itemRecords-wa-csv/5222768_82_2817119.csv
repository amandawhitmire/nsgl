12,Abstract:,"Since March 1968, research in acoustic techniques for resource assessment has been conducted by the Washington Sea Grant marine acoustics program. These studies have included development of data acquisition and processing systems, theoretical studies of sources of variance in hydroacoustic techniques, and applications of hydroacoustic techniques to fish stock assessments, especially to juvenile sockeye salmon in Lake Washington and to Pacific hake in Port Susan. Portable data collection systems that can be used on small boats are desirable because such systems reduce the cost of surveys, permit access to remote locations where large vessels are not available, and eliminate the risk of failure due to malfunction of data processing equipment."
