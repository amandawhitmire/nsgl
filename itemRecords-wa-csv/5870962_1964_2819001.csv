10,Abstract:,"Most commercial herring fisheries in Alaska are limited- entry fisheries, with a total of 1,254 permit holders currently licensed. The purse seine and gillnet limited entry fisheries are managed in a 'derby' fashion, with permit-holders fishing until a pre-established quota is reached. There have been discussions among permit-holders in the southeast Alaska roe herring seine fishery about changing their fishery to a cooperative fishery, where individual allocations of the catch are pre-​established. However, the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a change are complex and difficult to assess. The purpose of this paper is to summarize fishers' attitudes toward current and alternative management practices in Alaska's limited entry roe herring fisheries. It does not endorse any one particular management strategy."
