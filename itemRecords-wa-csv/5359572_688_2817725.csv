10,,"Results support the hypothesis that Grays Harbor provides the nursery habitat for a significant portion of Washington's ""Cancer magister"" population and that a major fraction of the offshore fishery is initially dependent on estuaries for much of the year. Both 0+ and 1+ classes were abundant; Grays Harbor supported higher densities as well as greater populations of juvenile crabs than did the offshore region, even though the area of the harbor was 17-fold smaller. Growth of 0+ crabs was significantly greater in the estuary than offshore."
