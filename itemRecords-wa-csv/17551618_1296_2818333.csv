13,Abstract:,"Resource competition between animals is influenced by a number of factorsincludin​g the species, size and relative abundance of competing individuals. Streamdwellinga​nimals often experience variably available food resources, and someemploy territorial behaviors to increase their access to food. We investigated thefactors that affect dominance between resident, non-native brook trout and recolonizingjuv​enile coho salmon in the Elwha River, WA, USA, to see if brook trout are likelyto disrupt coho salmon recolonization via interference competition. During dyadiclaborator​y feeding trials, we hypothesized that fish size, not species, would determinewhich individuals consumed the most food items, and that species would have noeffect. We found that species, not size, played a significant role in dominance; cohosalmon won 95% of trials, even when only 52% the length of their brook troutcompetitor​s. As the pairs of competing fish spent more time together during a trialsequence, coho salmon began to consume more food, and brook trout began to losemore, suggesting that the results of early trials influenced fish performance later. Ingroup trials, we hypothesized that group composition and species would not influencefish foraging success. In single species groups, coho salmon consumed more thanbrook trout, but the ranges overlapped. Brook trout consumption remained constantthrough all treatments, but coho salmon consumed more food in treatments withfewer coho salmon, suggesting that coho salmon experienced more intra- than interspecificco​mpetition and that brook trout do not pose a substantial challenge. Basedon our results, we think it is unlikely that competition from brook trout will disruptElwha River recolonization by coho salmon."
