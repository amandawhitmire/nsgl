11,Abstract:,"By quantifying the heat flux out of different mid-ocean ridge segments in different stages of evolution, we hope to understand how the Earth's interior is convectively cooled. With this objective, two prototype instruments, a vent thermal imager and an electronic fluid flow meter and temperature sensor, were deployed along with a set of time-lapse video systems and an ocean bottom seismometer array at the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Results obtained and plans for a more advanced version of the flow sensor and an expanded version of the vent thermal imager are discussed in this report."
