12,Abstract:,"This stock assessment reports the recent trends and status of the Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) resource in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Commercial fishery landings in 2015 were 24.7 Mlb, up from 23.7 Mlb in 2014. The 2015 setline survey coastwide legal (O32) and total (O32+U32) WPUE were 5% higher than values observed in 2014. Age distributions in 2015 fromboth the survey and fishery remained similar to those observed in 2011-2014, indicating a relativelystablâ€‹e stock, and no clear evidence of recent strong coastwide recruitments. At the coastwide level, individual size-at-age remains low relative to the rest of the time series, although there has been little change over the last several years."
