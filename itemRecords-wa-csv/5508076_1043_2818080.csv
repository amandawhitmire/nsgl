10,Abstract:,"The U.S. ocean resources governance system is relatively new, and still lacks effective systems to coordinate and integrate management of multiple ocean resources. Generally, federal and state agencies that manage ocean resources miss the opportunity for integrated, coordinated management because resources are segmented so that each agency manages a discrete portion. The author has proposed a federal, multiple-use, ocean resource management system, based on analyses of land-based natural resource management agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. This paper analyzes the diverse constituencies for the hypothetical Ocean Resources Service (ORS). Included as constituencies are other government agencies, communities, resource-â€‹dependent communities, resource scientists and professionals, and the environmental movement. It is argued that the existing fragmented, acrimonious, socio-political context of ocean resource conflicts might be reduced under a new, integrated resource management regime which retained special features of existing marine resource management systems, such as the regional fishery management councils."
