15,Abstract:,"Certain marine hydroids of the genus ""Obelia"" contain calcium-​regulated photoproteins such as obelin. This book chapter describes approaches used to clone the cDNA for obelin from ""O. longissima"", to express the cDNA in ""Escherichia coli"" cells, to purify the product, and to charge it with synthetic coelenterazine. The authors also describe some of the properties of the recombinant obelin and compare them with corresponding properties of recombinant aequorin."
