15,Abstract:,"This report is intended primarily for investigators engaged in studies at Big Beef estuary. We have emphasized 1) estimates of phytoplankton populations, 2) bacteria of shellfish sanitation significance, 3) estimates of total food for shellfish, and 4) indicators of ecological change. The data may be useful in comparing Big Beef with other areas and as a reference line for following relatively long-term changes at Big Beef."
