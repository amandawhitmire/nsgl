10,Abstract:,"Washington Sea Grant calendar for the year 2021. If you live, work or play along Washington’s waters, Washington Sea Grant (WSG) serves you. WSG has been a leader in marine research, outreach, and education for 50 years, helping people throughout the state’s 39 counties understand and address the challenges facing Washington’s ocean and waters. From his studio overlooking Tongass Narrows in Ketchikan, Alaska, Ray Troll has made fish fun and evolution enchanting for fans worldwide. With scientific rigor, vivid draftsmanship, and whimsical design, Troll captures the wonder and weirdness of the underwater world, delighting children and biologists alike. He is a longtime friend and collaborator with the UW, and WSG is honored to present Ray Troll’s homage to our aquatic neighbors with this calendar, “Eternal Salmon,” pen and ink with digital color."
