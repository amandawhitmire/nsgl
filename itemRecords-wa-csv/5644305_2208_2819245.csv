12,Abstract:,"Dietary essentially of pantothenic acid for many cultured fish species has been well established; prolonged deficiency can cause extensive mortality, and fish in the early stages of deficiency develop anorexia that reduces growth rate. This study was conducted to determine whether RIA measurement of tissue concentrations of pantothenic acid could be used to detect sublinical pantothenic acid deficiency in rainbow trout and, if so, to determine which tissue was the most sensitive indicator of deficiency."
