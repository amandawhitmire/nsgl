10,Abstract:,"Contaminants in Puget Sound are a growing concern. Heavy metals like mercury, copper and lead are known to have neurological, developmental and reproductive effects on wildlife and humans. Organic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) can build up in marine animals, causing harm to salmon, English sole, harbor seals, orcas and other animals. Cleaning products may not be responsible for the majority of contaminants in Puget Sound but they do contribute to pollution problems. Understanding the level of toxicity in household cleaning products and using non-toxic cleaners suggested in the Clean and Simple workshop will help reduce the amount of chemicals that contaminate our local waters."
