9,Abstract:,"Streamer lines are the most commonly prescribed seabird bycatch mitigation measures for longline fisheries and one of the most effective (a primary measure). Streamer lines were an innovation of Japanese tuna fishermen to prevent bait loss to birds. They are inexpensive, simple and require no modification to fishing gear."
