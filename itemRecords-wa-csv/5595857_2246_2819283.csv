13,Abstract:,"Marine phycomycetes are common and widespread parasites of microscopic and macroscopic algae. These fungi periodically cause significant damage to commercially important crops such as ""Porphyra"". Little is known, however, of their basic biology or host-parasite interactions. Species of ""Pythium"" have been reported most often parasitizing marine red algae. This study summarizes environmental- and host-mediated infection processes and morphogenesis of ""Pythium marinum"" infecting ""Porphyra nereocystis"". Evidence is presented for separate chemical signals as triggers for zoospore adhesion and appressorium formation."
