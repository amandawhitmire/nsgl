8,Abstract:,"This guide describes and pictures some of the 'least wanted' marine or freshwater invasive species that threaten the Pacific Northwest. Some of these plants and animals already have reached our shores, some haven't. The species in this pamphlet are highlighted because they have been known to cause significant damage, both biological and economic, in other regions they have invaded. Species covered include smooth cordgrass, Chinese mitten crab, European green crab, and zebra mussel."
