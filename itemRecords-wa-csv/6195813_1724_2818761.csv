9,Abstract:,"This study aims to provide a decision model for increasing resilience in the coastal social-​ecological system and to compare collective expert preferences between Puget Sound, USA and Masan Bay, South Korea, based on the proposed model. A total of 30 management objectives were determined to build a hierarchic tree designed by principles of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Surveys were performed to target 35 experts in Puget Sound by face-to-face method and 28 experts in Masan Bay by mail method. Overall, the legal objective, which was to enable legislation, was the highest preferred component in both regions. The knowledge translation variable was also of higher preference score in both regions. ANOVA showed that Puget Sound experts significantly favored attention to the education, habitat restoration and species protection objectives compared to Masan Bay experts. Masan Bay experts placed greater emphasis on the legislation and the type of institutional design than Puget Sound experts. Using cluster analysis, four distinct groups in Puget Sound and three groups in Masan Bay were independently identified. One unique group in Puget Sound was characterized by its high preferences for habitat restoration and species protection, not observed in Masan Bay. Demographic variables failed to account for differences in groupings or preferences in either region, except for the variable ""favoring information source‟ in Puget Sound, implying that the demographic information was not related to the different group opinions. The analysis framework used here is shown to be effective in elucidating expert preferences regarding the overall structure and emphasis in coastal management programs, and thus can be applied to coastal policy development."
