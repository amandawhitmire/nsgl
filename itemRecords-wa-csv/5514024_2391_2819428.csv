14,Abstract:,"The insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) are mitogenic peptide hormones with important functions in the regulation of development and somatic growth. The close similarity between insulin and the IGFs has raised important questions concerning the evolutionary origins of these hormones and the basis for their conserved primary structures. The first nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of preproIGF-I from a teleost, the coho salmon, is reported here. Results clearly show that conserved primary structure and regulation of expression of IGF-I by GH extends phylogeneticall​y to, and likely below, the bony fishes."
