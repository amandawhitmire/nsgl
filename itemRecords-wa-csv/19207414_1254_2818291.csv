12,Abstract:,"In 2010, residents of Boone, North Carolina, called their fire department toreport the unusual smell of mothballs in the air. Nearby, officials found that dead crayfish and trout littered Hodges Creek. Naphthalene is the volatile chemical that gives mothballs their particular smell; it belongs to a group of chemicals called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). What was the sudden source of the naphthalene and was it tied to the fish kill? It turns out that a parking lot with a storm drain to Hodges Creek had been treated with coal-tar sealant just prior to a large rainstorm, which had flushed much of the sealant into Hodges Creek. This creek is located in a highly urbanized area with multiple potential sources of toxic chemical inputs. However, the sudden and complete die-off of resident fish and invertebrates for 1.5 miles downstream of the parking lot following the rain event does not leave much doubt as to the cause. Applicators avoid applying sealcoat prior to rain, but this unfortunate event highlights the toxic potential of coal-tar sealcoats to aquatic animals."
