7,Abstract:,"Two decades ago, the National Sea Grant Fellows Program/Dean John A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship was established to provide a unique educational experience to students who have an interest in ocean and Great Lakes resources and in the national policy affecting those resources. The program, sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration'​s National Sea Grant College Program, matches highly-​qualified graduate students with 'hosts' in the Legislative Branch, the Executive Branch, or appropriate associations/in​stitutions located in the Washington, DC., area for a one-year paid fellowship. This directory for 1979-1998 describes something of the program and its history, and list, with present affiliations, its 368 alumni."
