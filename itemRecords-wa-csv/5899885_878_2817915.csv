16,Abstract:,"Scientists report on the habitat-â€‹dependent invasion and control pattern of the English cordgrass, ""Spartina anglica"" in Puget Sound, Washington. They hypothesize that invasion success and control are dependent on a relatively complex interplay between habitat physical conditions and species interactions."
