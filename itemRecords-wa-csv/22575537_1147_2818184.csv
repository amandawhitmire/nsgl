63,Abstract:,"This document is a companion to the ecosystem status report (ESR) provided by the California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment team (CCIEA team) to the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) in March of 2019 (Harvey et al. 2019). The CCIEA team provides ESRs annually to PFMC, as one component of the overall CCIEA goal of providing quantitative, integrative science tools, products, and synthesis in support of a more holistic (ecosystem-​based) approach to managing marine resources in the California Current."
