8,Abstract:,"For many years it was believed that bivalves only concentrated paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins from dinoflagellates ingested. However, recent findings suggest that some shellfish and bacteria associated with marine invertebrates can decrease or increase the lethality of the toxins by decarbamoxylatiâ€‹ng them or transforming gonyautoxins and neosaxitoxin to saxitoxin (STX). The purpose of the work described here was to test whether: (1) nontoxic butter clams from the Hood Canal (Puget Sound, WA) could absorb and retain PSP toxins from ingested ""P. catenella"" and form STX from other toxins, (2) there are similarities between tissues which retain toxins in the feeding experiments and those of clams in the field, and (3) there are trends in toxin type and concentration in different tisses of butter clams in the field."
