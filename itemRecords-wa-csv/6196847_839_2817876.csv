12,Abstract:,"The native Olympia oyster (Ostrea conchaphila) once supported important commercial and subsistence fisheries in Puget Sound, Washington, but suffered drastic declines due to overexploitatio​n and pulp mill pollution. Recovery has been slow, and one potentially limiting factor is the effect of nonindigenous species, in particular predation by the Japanese oyster drill (Ocinebrina inornata). Japanese drills historically caused significant economic losses to Olympia oyster aquaculture, but their impact on recent restoration efforts remains largely unknown. If drills have a saturating (e.g., Type I or II) functional response, they could keep local oyster populations suppressed at low levels. However, the magnitude of drill impacts may depend on the availability of alternative prey species, such as barnacles and nonindigenous bivalves. To test these hypotheses, we measured drill predation rates by transplanting Olympia oysters into several sites in Puget Sound. At some sites, drills were responsible for a large fraction (up to 100%) of total oyster mortalities over a three- to four-month period, but predation pressure was highly variable within and among sites and was only weakly related to drill density. The per capita interaction strength of drills diminished with increasing density of naturally occurring Olympia oysters, indicating that drill feeding rates saturate when prey are abundant. In addition, there was an indirect effect of alternative prey: drill per capita interaction strength was negatively related to densities of barnacles (Balanus spp.) and Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas). We performed enclosure experiments manipulating drill, Olympia oyster, and barnacle (Balanus glandula) densities to directly estimate the shape and parameters of the drill functional response. The data strongly support a saturating, but not sigmoid (Type III) response, consistent with the oyster transplant study. These results suggest that controlling Japanese drills would benefit Olympia oyster recovery or restoration efforts in some areas; however, drill eradication is notoriously difficult and labor-​intensive. Native oyster restoration may be possible even in the presence of drills if local abundance and recruitment are sufficient to saturate drill feeding rates, or if alternative prey are available."
