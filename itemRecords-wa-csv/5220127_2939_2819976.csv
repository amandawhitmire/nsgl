10,Abstract:,"A two-​dimensional-​linear theoretical model has been developed which can predict the performance of floating breakwaters of arbitrary cross-sectional shape, including catamarans. This theory is applied to various breakwaters of differenct shapes and results are compared with measurements from the model tank and prototype installation in the field. These results indicate that the theoretical model may be very useful as a design and reserch tool and where additional development of the theoretical model is required."
