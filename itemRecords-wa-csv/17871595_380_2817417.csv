14,Abstract:,"The globally invasive European green crab has been on the Salish Sea’s doorstep for two decades, but none were captured from Salish Sea shorelines until 2012. That year, a population was discovered in Sooke Inlet, just west of Victoria, British Columbia. The discovery increased concern about potential impacts of European green crab on Washington’s inland marine shorelines and reinvigorated interest in and support for early detection monitoring. In response, Washington Sea Grant developed the Crab Team with support from the US Environmental Protection Agency and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW). Crab Team is a volunteer monitoring network carefully designed to maximize the likelihood of detecting green crab while populations are manageable and for gathering related data to increase understanding of natural conditions in suitable green crab habitat. In this report, we share information about European green crab, the Crab Team approach to monitoring, the Crab Team volunteer training and engagement process and the findings and results from the first two years of Crab Team data collection."
