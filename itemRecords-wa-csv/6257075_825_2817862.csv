14,Abstract:,"Many chemicals contaminating fish and aquatic ecosystems are known to disrupt endocrine function, potentially leading to impaired development and reproduction of wildlife and humans. To evaluate relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., reduced food availability, hypoxia, endocrine disrupting chemicals) and fish reproductive health, comprehensive and sensitive bioassessment tools are needed."
