10,Abstract:,"It has only been since the late 1950s that issues concerning the development, use, and management of marine and coastal resources have been perceived as deserving sustained national policy attention. A general shift in governmental authority away from the states and toward Washington has characterized management efforts; many of the policies behind them were the product of the burgeoning amount of environmental legislation passed during the 1970s, much of which was directed at ocean resources. Not surprisingly, the character of relations between and among state, federal, and local governments was determined far more by a mix of political feasibility, and the desires of shifting coalitions of interest groups, than by any comprehensive philosophical concern for the distribution of power, authority and competence in the federal system. The result through 1980 was an ad hoc set of arrangements where intergovernment​al relations took their distinctive contours for each resource or use from legislation, court decisions, and the experience of implementation. The nature of these relationships are reviewed here in the context of the key policies for fisheries, marine mammals, offshore hydrocarbons and minerals, marine pollution, and coastal resource management."
