10,Abstract:,"For ""Caulobacter"" spp. and other prosthecate bacteria, adhesion to surfaces is accomplished by a clearly defined, discrete organelle, termed a holdfast. This organelle is present on the cell surface during both phases of the dimorphic life cycle. The discrete location and unambiguous function of the holdfast make it amenable to several types of initial investigation concerning the composition, sensitivity to enzymatic decomposition, and surface preferences for binding without the substance first being isolated in pure form. Reported here are the results of lectin-binding studies, sensitivity to hydrolytic enzymes and polysaccharide synthesis inhibitors, and the potential for using the results of these assays to monitor the biochemical purification of the caulobacter holdfast."
