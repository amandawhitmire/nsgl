11,Abstract:,"Management agencies need accurate information on the number of migrating salmon because successful management, critical to the livelihood of thousands of families and businesses, requires ensuring the optimum numbers of returning fish (called escapement) for brood purposes. Every salmon species in every river system has a unique level of escapement optimal for maximum productivity of that stock. Optimal management requires control of the current harvest based on data from the current migration. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a new acoustic technique as an instrument for monitoring salmon escapements. If the device proves feasible, it would be less expensive than other monitoring methods currently in use and it is potentially more accurate."
