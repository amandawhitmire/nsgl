11,Abstract:,"The potential for heterotrophic microzooplankto​n to serve as a significant source of nutrition for crab larvae begs the question of how their own nutritional ecology influences their quality as prey. In this study, larvae of 4 species of crabs of the genus ""Cancer"" were raised in the laboratory from hatching to the post-larval megalopa stage on diets of nauplii of the brine shrimp ""Artemia"" sp. and on 2 diets of the rotifer ""Brachionus plicatilis"". One of the rotifer diets had been cultured on the chlorophyte ""Dunaliella tertiolecta"", the other on the chrysophyte Isochrisis galbana"". ""Dunaliella""-​fed rotifers did not support development to the megalopa, whereas ""Isochrisis""- fed rotifers did. The authors attribute differences between the 2 rotifer diets to the high content of long chain, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in ""I. galbana"" and their absence in ""D. tertiolecta""."
