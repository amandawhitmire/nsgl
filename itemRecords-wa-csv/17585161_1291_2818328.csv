13,Abstract:,"Vast expanses of intact coastal and marine habitat exist along the coastline of Pacific County, within andoutside of the powerhouse estuary of Willapa Bay. In the water, mudflats, shellfish and eelgrass bedsprovide food and shelter for young Pacific salmon, Dungeness crab and migratory birds. On shore, coastaldunes and forests are a source of high quality habitat for flora and fauna alike. This collection of habitats alsobuffers the shoreline from storms and flooding, protecting people, property and infrastructure"
