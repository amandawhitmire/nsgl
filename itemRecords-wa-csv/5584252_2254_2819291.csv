11,Abstract:,"The sequence and secondary structure of chloroplast 16S rRNA from the marine chromophyte (chlorophyll a,c containing) ""Olisthodiscus luteus"" is presented in this report. Few data exist for the ""chl"" a,c algae, whose evolutionary relationship with respect to the chlorophytic (""chl"" a,b containing) plants remains a source of continued debate."
