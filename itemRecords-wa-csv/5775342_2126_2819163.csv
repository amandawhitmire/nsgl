11,Abstract:,"The biosynthesis of the bicyclic depsipeptide salinamide A, a potent anti-​inflammatory agent, in the marine bacterium ""Streptomyces"" sp. CNB-091 has been examined through feeding experiments with 13C-labeled intermediates. Initial findings notably on the origin of the carbons in the unusual (""p""- alkoxyphenyl)gl​ycine unit of this bicyclic depsipeptide are reported."
