12,Abstract:,"Flesh coloration in commercially reared salmon is an important attribute which influences product marketability and consumer acceptance. Since carotenoid pigments are introduced as dietary additives, the selection of individuals with increased absorption and deposition rates would result in lower dietary supplementation and significantly reduced feed costs. This paper reports the results of research to estimate the degree of genetic control for pigmentation and correlations between pigmentation, body size traits, and flesh composition. This information will provide criteria for a selection scheme to enhance flesh coloration."
