10,Abstract:,"Shoreline armoring has both beneficial and adverse effects. On the beneficial side, shoreline armoring continues to save millions of dollars of valuable waterfront real estate preserving valuable upland by reducing direct exposure to damaging coastal storm waves and flooding (Fig 1). Shoreline stabilization can also help waterfront property owners protect the sales value of individual properties. The financial benefits of maintaining the value of waterfront construction as a result of shoreline armoring, however, appear to remain only with the waterfront dwellings or dwellings within very close proximately of the shore. Property values only several rows inland lowers with the on-going effects of shoreline armoring, and even waterfront property values decline as more and more waterfront property owners rely on shoreline stabilization/a​rmoring (Kriesel & Friedman, 2003). On the adverse side, shoreline armoring along eroding shores continues to be responsible for the reduction in the beneficial functions and sometimes complete loss of valuable coastal resources, such as beaches, dunes, and intertidal areas. This results in the loss or alteration of associated marine habitat. Lateral beach access can also be restricted or completely lost. These impacts, particularly the loss of sandy beaches, have great relevance in states such as Hawaii where the public has the right of use of all beaches statewide. Hawaii's beaches are the backbone of a $13 billion dollar visitor economy providing approximately 171,900 jobs: the bulk of the state's jobs and income. Over 60% of all jobs in Hawaii are related to tourism, which depends on the appeal of sandy beaches (Genz, et al, 2007). Similarly, 16.9 million people work in the travel and tourism industry that contributes $1.2 trillion to the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and $223 billion in taxes (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2001). Beach tourism is by far the largest tourism industry in the U.S. (Houston, 1996)."
