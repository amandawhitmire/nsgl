9,Abstract:,"Many Sea Grant programs have been quick to realize the extraordinary potential of this powerful new communication and information tool. With little coordination or prior discussion, these programs established a creative and formidable network presence on the Web. However, the contents and appearance of our earliest Web offerings have varied considerably in quality and depth. More importantly, the representation of programs was patchy and haphazard. For this reason a group of Sea Grant communicators and others, created this guidebook. It contains the task group's recommendations for Web site content, style and marketing, along with a section on network resources and training, and a bibliography."
