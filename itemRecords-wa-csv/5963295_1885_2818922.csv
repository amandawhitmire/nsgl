12,Abstract:,"In this study, scientists examined the possibility that pea HMG-I/Y may mediate the induction of plant defense gene expression in the pea-""Fusarium"" interaction. Several pea defense gene promoters, such as those from DRR49 and DRR206, have tracts of DNA that are extraordinarily AT- rich, representing potential binding sites for pea HMG-I/Y. Analyses of pea HMG-I/Y expression indicates that HMG-I/Y is down-regulated in pea pod tissue following inoculation with fungal pathogens and treatment with the two fungal elicitors, chitosan and ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli"" DNase. This report follows both the transcription of the HMG-I/Y and DRR206 of pea in pea endocarp tissue and the effect of agro-â€‹infiltration expression of pea HMG-I/Y on the heterologous expression of the DRR206 promoter stably transferred to tobacco. The results suggest that an inverse relationship may exist between suppressed HMG-I/Y expression and the increased expression of defense genes in pea."
