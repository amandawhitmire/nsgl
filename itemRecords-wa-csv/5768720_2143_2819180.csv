11,Abstract:,"Most of the once-rich stocks of commercially significant crustacean fisheries in the Greater Gulf of Alaska have collapsed, leading to debate on causes and management options. This 50-page paper examines trends in catch, recruitment, and abundance and discusses evidence of overfishing and management options. Spatially explicit strategies are suggested, including the creation of reproductive refuges. Specific species considered include: red king crab, brown king crab, blue king crab, Tanner crab, Dungeness crab, pink shrimp, sidestripe shrimp, spot prawn, and coonstripe shrimp."
