10,Abstract:,"The primary market for Pacific oysters in the Pacific Northwest utilizes a fresh raw product and shucking of fresh oysters is currently accomplished entirely by hand. Alternative solutions to counteract the labor shortage include: (1) development of an automated shucking process or mach1ne, or (2) identification or development of techniques to simplify hand opening. Severa​l attempts to develop machines for automated shucking of East Coast and Gulf varieties of oysters have been undertaken 1n the past and efforts in this direction are still underway. The objectives of this study were to identify and assess the feasibility of new or improved methods for automated shucking of Pacific oysters. A secondary goal was the identification of techniques to facilitate hand opening to reduce labor requirements. I​n all, twelve techniques or combinations of techniques were investigated. The results are summarized on a table in this report."
