9,Abstract:,"The CHRN is comprised of hazards and climate change practitioners from federal and state government agencies, academic institutions, and nonprofit organizations that are involved in coastal hazard management and/or producing risk and hazard assessments for marine shorelines in Washington State. The primary purpose of the Coastal Hazards Resilience Network (CHRN) is to improve regional coordination, integration, and understanding of coastal hazards and climate change impacts through effective partnerships. In addition, the network aims to address multi-hazard planning, preparedness, adaptation, response and recovery as critical needs in Washington State. Since its establishment, the Network has become a useful point of contact for those interested in engaging with other state agencies on coastal resilience issues."
