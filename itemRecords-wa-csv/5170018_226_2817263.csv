10,Abstract:,"This report presents a further examination of the equilibrium cuspate shoreline on a beach, observed and discussed by Komar (1971). A complete derivation of' the equilibrium condition is presented herein, only the results of which were published in Komar (1971). In addition, the approach is extended and generalized to include the generation of longshore currents by a combination of an oblique wave approach to the shoreline and a longshore variation in wave height. The equilibrium condition observed by Komar (1971) is a special case of this generalized relationship. T​his report was presented under the title ""Longshore Current Generation"" at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the American Geophysical Union, April 1972, Washington, D. C."
