10,Abstract:,"Preventing pollution from stormwater runoff is one of the top three priorities for Puget Sound. Stormwater runoff comes from many sources including traditional residential landscaping practices, which can contribute excess runoff containing nutrients, pesticides, and sediment to fresh and marine water bodies. Many local, regional, and state plans encourage and require alternative low-impact residential practices designed to reduce these water quality and quantity impacts. Many studies and feedback through focus groups, assessments, and surveys indicate that helping people understand what changes are needed and overcoming barriers to making those changes require a variety of actions. The purpose of this program is to increase homeowner knowledge, commitment, and implementation of behavior changes in order to reduce impacts associated with residential landscaping practices in Whatcom County. Washington State University Whatcom County Extension is uniquely supported in implementing this and other water resource programs through an ongoing partnership with Washington Sea Grant."
