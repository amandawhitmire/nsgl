8,Abstract:,"This paper addresses the discrepancy between theoretical advances in common resource management and the persistence of suboptimal regulations. Why have many traditional fishery regulatory techniques survived the onslaught of theory and data that demonstrate their suboptimality? One hypothesis advanced in the fishery economics literature is a `biological bias' in the historical development of fishery management (most managers are trained in biology). But this argument does not adequately explain the prevalence of gear and vessel restrictions imposed in most regulated fisheries. The biological bias theory does not explain why fishermen would favor traditional regulations when it appears that, as a group, they would benefit under a limited entry or quota system with grandfathered rights. The following joint hypotheses are proposed as an alternative explanation: (""a"") Traditional controls do not have equal wealth effects on all fishermen and so promote wealth redistributionsâ€‹. (""b"") Hence, regulations that appear to be perverse are the results of rational maximizers exploiting the political process for redistributive gains. The author argues that, not only can contracting costs inhibit the adoption of `better' regulations, but also many fishermen prefer the traditional controls precisely because the controls redistribute the catch. Thus, even when entry restrictions or quotas are adopted, they may not replace the old regulations."
