14,Abstract:,"The combination of conservative structural design, diversified reproductive ecology, and a meaningful environmental axis along which variability can be conceptually organized, makes cancrids a promising basis for the testing of current ideas on crab mating ecology and sexual selection. A scattered literature has dealt with four main topics: types of mating system, effective size at sexual maturity, relative claw size, and potential for sperm competition. This study investigated these subjects on ""Cancer gracilis"", an open-habitat species in the Puget Sound area, through a combination of field sampling, observational data and laboratory experiments. Results are discussed in the context of the 'structured-â€‹open' habitat gradient which, it is argued, constitutes the template for the diversification of cancrid morphology and breeding systems."
