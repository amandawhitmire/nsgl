12,Abstract:,"Reviving the Past to Protect the FutureThe Swinomish Indian Tribal Community (SITC) is working near Similk Bay to revive an ancient mariculture practice by installing the first present-day clam garden in the United States. Clam gardens are shoreline habitats modified by Northwest Coastal Indigenous people to increase the area of clam habitat to improve shellfish production. Healthy and productive shellfish beds provide important local foods and support human well-being and cultural practices. The beds may also provide ecosystem services such as locally reduced ocean acidification and improved shoreline habitat for a healthy food web. Restoring native clam populations is a priority for the Puget Sound Partnership, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Northwest Tribes, including the SITC. Utilizing clam gardens promotes the integration of traditional ecological knowledge in contemporary resource management, encourages local food security, supports tribal treaty rights, and provides ecological and cultural benefits to the community."
