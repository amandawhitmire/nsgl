11,Abstract:,"Washington waters offer a delectable variety of clams, oysters, mussels, and scallops readily available to be gathered and enjoyed. At certain times, however, some shellfish become unsafe to eat because they contain a poison harmful to human beings. Paralytic shellfish poisoning, commonly known as PSP, is a danger that you as a shellfish consumer can avoid by being well informed and by observing certain basic precautions. This bulletin provides information about PSP, its symptoms and treatment, and its relationship to 'red tides.'"
