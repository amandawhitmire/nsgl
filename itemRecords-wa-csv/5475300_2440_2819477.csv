10,Abstract:,"Containerizatio​n, the movement of cargo in containers, is a dynamic system within which the players (carriers, terminal operators, stevedores, labor, port authorities, shippers, railroads, truckers, government, and others) all interact. Each exerts influence over productivity and at one time or another may be the primary determinant or constraint on control of productivity at a specific terminal or within the entire system. A major problem that faces the system is that each player reacts according to what he perceives his own best interests to be at any given moment--often with little or no concern for the system or, more exactly, for the efficiency of the system. Whenever someone looks at the containerizatio​n system, there is an assumption that if the terminal works at its maximum efficiency, then the entire system benefits. However, maximizing terminal efficiency might only shift the bottlenecks to some other element within the system. This paper provides a perspective on container terminal productivity-​-​how it is measured, the validity of the measurements used, and the factors that affect the elements of productivity."
