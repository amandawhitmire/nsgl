10,Abstract:,"White sturgeon (""Acipenser transmontanus"") is one of seven sturgeon species found in North America. It is also the largest freshwater fish on this continent, exceeding 1,000 pounds in weight and sometimes reaching nearly 20 feet in length. Modern relics of an ancient group of fishes, white sturgeon inhabit the larger rivers and bays of the Pacific Coast from Ensenada, Mexico, to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Sturgeon stocks throughout the world have been depressed because of demand for their highly valued flesh and the caviar produced from their eggs. Human activities in watersheds where sturgeon live have also affected sturgeon habitat. This publication examines the part played by fish locks and ladders in the continued presence of white sturgeon along the Columbia River. These fishways, though designed for salmon and steelhead, have also helped the bottom-dwelling sturgeon to migrate past dams; further efforts to improve fishway design could result in still greater gains by the sturgeon population in the Columbia River region."
