10,Abstract:,"High performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC), autoanalyzer (AA) and mouse bioassay techniques were used to measure the levels of the toxins associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) in shellfish extracts. The HPLC procedure described incorporates several improvements from the previously reported method and correlation with the mouse bioassay is good. The AA utilizes the same principle for toxin detection as HPLC (alkaline oxidation/fluor​escence) but provides no means of separating the individual PSP toxins; it is useful for rapidly screening shellfish extracts for presence of the PSP toxins."
