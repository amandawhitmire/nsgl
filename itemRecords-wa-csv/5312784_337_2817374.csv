13,Abstract:,"During the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, a large number of econometric studies were produced which focused on the factors affecting the demand for seafood products. The rapid growth in studies of this type was largely due ta attempts ta correct open access common property! problems present in existing fisheries and ta incorporate economic concepts in the management of developing fisheries. During this period the opportunity to expand management control over fisheries often came from declarations of extended fishing zones by many nations. In order to move from biological notions such as maximum sustainable yield ta bioeconomic notions of maximum economic yield, it became necessary to understand price-quantity and market structure relationships. Both descriptive and analytical studies of demand and supply, as well as market structure studies, flourished. In the United States these studies were largely sponsored by the National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS! and the newly founded National Sea Grant College Program. In other areas of the world, sponsorship was by both national and international agencies and foundations. In large part, research focused on the markets for domestically harvested species. The objectives of the conference were to learn more about the various fisheries around the world and the international trade patterns in those fisheries, to facilitate communication among individuals with interest in seafood trade questions, and to explore the possibilities of cooperative research and data exchange. Participants came from industry, governments, and the universities of 21 different countries."
14,,"Letter from President Ronald Reagan included in this document: "" I am delighted to extend my warm greetings to all those gathered for the International Seafood Trade Conference. This conference brings added recognition to some of the most critical issues facing people around the globe. With the increasing need for protein from the sea, international trade will play an especially valuable role in filling that need and feeding a hungry world. This means that we must continue to work to lower the barriers to trade in fish and shellfish and to increase cooperation in the development of our fishing industry. We must also recognize the need for effective management of the world' s living marine resources. They cannot be harvested without limit and our task is not only their more efficient utilization today but also their wide use for future generations. You have my best wishes for a productive conference and every success in the future."" (Ronald Reagan, The White House, Washington DC, August 20, 1982)"
