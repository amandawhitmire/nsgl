11,Abstract:,"Estuaries and coastal wetlands are among the most important ecosystems in the nation. The need for protecting, preserving, and restoring these valuable ecosystems was a major factor in passage of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) in 1972. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of state Coastal Management Programs (CMPs) in protecting estuaries and coastal wetlands. Data collection and state profile development were based on published information, structured interviews with state officials, and unpublished information from reports, permit tracking databases, and other sources. Once all available data for the twenty-nine states were collected and state CZM profiles developed, individual state programs were evaluated for effectiveness in a four-step, structured process. To the extent that outcome data were available (it was meager in many cases), it was found that state CMPs are relatively effective. Among the various management tools used by states, regulatory programs rated the highest for their contributions to estuary and coastal wetland protection. But a variety of other strategies and tools, many built around state-local planning partnerships, also contributed significantly. State CMP weaknesses were also apparent, including a general lack of organized outcome monitoring. The following papers are included in this publication: 1.
