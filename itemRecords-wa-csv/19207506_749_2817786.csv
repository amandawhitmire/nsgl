10,Abstract:,"Stormwater sneaks up on the Seattle region so innocently, as rain droplets falling through the misty air, but when it hits the ground, it picks up bacteria from lawn fertilizers, copper from break pad deposits, oil from vehicle emissions and other pollutants that become deadly to salmon and Orcas when they trickle into Puget Sound. That's why we partnered with Washington State University to solve stormwater issues surrounding our urban cities."
