10,Abstract:,"Chitosan and chitosan derivatives have found uses or potential uses in a wide variety of applications. However, the effectiveness of the polymers have been found to be dependent upon their molecular weight. Especially for biomedical applications, manufacture of well characterized polymers of known molecular weight may be necessary to obtain governmental approval for the products. The objective of this research was therefore to quantify the depolymerizatio​n of chitosan so that polymers of known molecular weight could be reproducibly manufactured. Unfortunately, chitosan is very resistant to the traditional methods of polysaccharide depolymerizatio​n. Accordingly, a kinetic study of the homogeneous depolymerizatio​n of chitosan by the use of nitrous acid was performed over a wide range of experimental conditions. The effect of the concentrations of nitrous acid solvent were examined in conjunction with the temperature of the reaction."
