10,Abstract:,"The Pacific Aquaculture Caucus hosted a two-day workshop on aquaculture regulations and research goals as they relate to the west coast region of the U.S. Drawing on experiences from the existing arenas on international, national, state, and tribal aquaculture, participants set out to envision a legal and administrative framework to enable the west coast industry to preserve cultural and social values, while meeting production goals identified in new national policies. The problems, solutions, and research topics required to achieve these goals are summarized here."
