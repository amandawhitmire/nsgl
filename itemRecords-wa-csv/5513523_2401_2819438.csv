12,Abstract:,"The multi-agency Puget Sound Dredge Disposal Analysis (PSDDA) Program was formed to site, evaluate, and manage the long-term unconfined disposal of dredged sediments in Puget Sound. As part of the siting process, trawl assessments of demersal in vertebrate and bottomfish resources were conducted for the purpose of siting disposal areas to minimize potential resource conflicts. Coincident with the PSDDA evaluations was the need of the U.S. Navy to identify a confined (capped) disposal site in Port Gardner for open-water disposal of contaminated sediments, and seasonal trawl assessments were made for this purpose also. The objective of this paper is to provide a synopsis of the methods and sites involved in the trawl studies and provide a summary of the general findings together with appropriate references to the detailed final reports."
