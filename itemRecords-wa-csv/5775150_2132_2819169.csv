11,Abstract:,This fact sheet discusses the introduction of the European green crab into North American habitats where it has generally had disastrous effects on native species. It documents the spread of the green crab from the East Coast to the West Coast and its progress towards the coastal areas of Washington state. It also explains ways that humans inadvertantly spread its range.
