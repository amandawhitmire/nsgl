12,Abstract:,"Our vulnerable coastal ecosystems in the Salish Sea—more than 4,000 milesof shoreline—are subject to impacts of development and require special attention. Consider these impacts: Shoreline armoring (built for coastal defense and erosion control) negatively affects nearshore fish distribution and behavior, alters aquatic communities, and eliminates upland vegetation (Toft et al. 2010).Coastal development also increases water pollution via urban stormwater runoff carrying sediments, nutrients, toxic chemicals, and bacteria (Waycott etal. 2009). While residents are drawn to, and value protecting, the region’s beauty, preserving this beauty requires careful planning efforts that balance development with shoreline protection. What tools can help planners incorporate coastal ecology into effective shoreline planning? How can we modify traditional planning systems designed for nonwaterfront projects to the waterfront? Planning practitioners in the Salish Sea have created, adopted, and applied innovative planning tools that address the impacts of urban waterfront redevelopment on coastal ecosystems, in partnership with (and sometimes driven by) a strong scientific community and an environmentally aware citizenry. In this chapter, using examples from the Salish Sea region, we highlight environmental planning tools used in master planning, site planning, and site design that may be useful to planners in other coastal areas.These tools focus on addressing observed impacts of development, including restoring nearshore (shallow water) ecosystems, restoring connectivity between aquatic and terrestrial habitat, and reducing pollution from urban stormwater runoff."
