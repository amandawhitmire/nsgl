10,Abstract:,"The initiation of the non-host resistance, in which pea tissue resists the bean pathogen ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli"" (Fsph), is more durable than R gene or race specific resistance. This suggests that multiple signaling routes may exist for inducing the PR genes that ultimately express resistance. Previously, the biotic elicitors, chitosan and FsphDNase, were shown to be released from the pathogen and to induce resistance by targeting pea DNA. Currently pea tissue was treated with an array of 40 inhibitors of an array of cellullar functions to identify other potential targets. Sub-microgram levels of phosphatase and kinase inhibitors potently induce phytoalexin (pisatin) production, significantly enhance PR gene expression and improve resistance lo a pea pathogen. At microgram levels they break down the pea's non-host resistance within 24 hours. DNA may not be an initial target of phosphatase inhibitors, but their presence caused DNA damage, possibly by changing the phosphorylalion patterns of nuclear proteins. The benefits of inhibitor array vs. microarray as well as their combined merits will be discussed."
