11,Abstract:,"This paper presents case studies of selected fisheries in the Northern California Current Ecosystem, a transition environment highly sensitive to environmental forcing on multiple time scales. The fisheries discussed include Oregon coastal coho salmon, canary rockfish, Pacific hake, Pacific sardine, Dungeness crab, and pandalid shrimp. The hope is that a critical examination of the relationships between these stocks and their environment, and the management approaches that evolved around these relationships, will give insight as to how to facilitate the response of these populations to the future impacts of both fisheries and global change. The fisheries examined here respond in different ways to highly similar environmental forcing, suggesting that successful management requires the protection of each stock's strategy for coping with environmental change."
