8,Abstract:,"Tourism is the world's largest industry. Rural areas experiencing declines in natural resource-based economies are looking to tourism as a development opportunity. One such area is Newfoundland, Canada, where a moratorium on cod fishing that affected all aspects of society gave rise to a modern tourism industry. The period following the moratorium offers a finite timeframe for analyzing the success of tourism development in a rural, coastal location devastated by the loss of a natural resource. This report documents the results of research conducted in 2008 to evaluate the impact of the 1992 cod moratorium on Newfoundland's rural coastal villages (""outports""), and the role of tourism in community revitalization efforts. Newfoundland and Maine have a common history of European settlement based on marine resource exploitation in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. Newfoundland's experience developing tourism in the face of significant economic and social changes can inform tourism development in coastal Maine, where reliance on a single fishery (lobster) mirrors Newfoundland's pre-​cod-​collapse economy and culture. Findings from this research may be especially relevant to Downeast Maine (coastal Hancock and Washington counties), where regional history, geography, and fisheries heritage are similar to Newfoundland."
