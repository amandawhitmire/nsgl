8,Abstract:,"The purpose of this paper is to present the argument that state government should increase its attention to ocean affairs and to show the steps two western coastal states have taken to assert influence in the 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ). State government can be an important force in shaping U.S. ocean management policy. The Reagan Administration has shown no interest in comprehensive ocean policy, and has actively sought to dismantle what little federal governmental apparatus there is for non-military ocean affairs. This policy vacuum at the federal level provides both the necessity and the opportunity for state government to assert its interests and to take new initiatives."
