14,Abstract:,Applications and technologies for biological sensing are presented and discussed. Biological sensors based on optical transduction approaches have been developed at Texas Instruments (TI) and representative examples of demonstrated transducers are described. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is highlighted as an important biosensor transducer because of the capability of this technique in measuring binding events between antibodies and antigens. Biosensor results using the TI SPR transducer are shown.
