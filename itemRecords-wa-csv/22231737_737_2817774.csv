9,Abstract:,"Welcome to the Washington Aquaculture website, a portal for state-wide aquaculture information and activities. The site serves as a clearing house of information that we, our collaborators and partners have produced on aquaculture. Explore the site for conference and symposia history and publications ranging from basic studies of geoduck, oyster and other shellfish species to farming, ecology and species recovery. Washington Sea Grant has been involved with aquaculture for more than four decades, supporting research and community outreach, producing publications and providing information to assist those pursuing aquaculture activities. We hope you find the site useful."
