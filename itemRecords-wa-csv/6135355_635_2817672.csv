9,Abstract:,"Seabird mortality in longline fisheries is a worldwide marine conservation problem. Seabirds aggregate in response to fishing operations and can become hooked and drown as they attack sinking baited hooks. Because many seabirds are long-lived species with delayed maturity and limited reproductive capability, they are highly vulnerable to adult mortality. Building on earlier collaborative work to reduce the bycatch of seabirds in salmon drift gillnets, Washington Sea Grant Program launched a suite of research and outreach programs in collaboration with industry, NOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reduce seabird bycatch in Alaska’s diverse longline fisheries. More recently this work was extended to Alaska’s trawl fisheries. Outcomes: • Paired streamer lines were proven to be near 100-​percent effective at eliminating the catch of albatrosses and other surface-​feeding birds. • Both sablefish and cod fishing fleets adopted this new technology, two years before it was required — resulting in an eight-fold decrease in seabird mortality. • Antarctic seabird avoidance requirements were modified in 2003, based on findings from the Alaska research."
