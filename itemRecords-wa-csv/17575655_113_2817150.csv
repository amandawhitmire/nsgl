14,Abstract:,"This report is one of three marine spatial planning (MSP) case study reports produced by the Coastal Resources Center/Rhode Island Sea Grant College Program (CRC) at the URI Graduate School of Oceanography. It is part of CRC’s broader ongoing research and capacity‐buildi​ng initiative to strengthen the network of marine spatial planning and coastal management practitioners. The purpose of the case studies is to document and share lessons learned from examples of marine spatial planning in the U.S. in order to build the capacity of MSP and coastal management practitioners. Research was conducted in three locations: Rhode Island, Washington State and San Francisco. The Rhode Island case focused on implementation of the Rhode Island Ocean Special Area Management Plan; the Washington case focused on the ongoing development of the Washington Coast Marine Spatial Plan; and the San Francisco study became a two‐case analysis of two different Coast Guard‐led waterways management initiatives. CRC has produced three technical reports summarizing case study research as well as a series of shorter publications highlighting key findings. The Washington State Pacific coast has a long history of its people making a living from its natural resources. Home to four coastal Treaty Tribes as well as communities that make a living from fishing, tourism, and logging, the people from this region have traditionally played a leadership role in the management of their coasts and offshore waters in partnership with state and federal government. Using tools, including community‐devel​oped shoreline management plans, national and state marine conservation areas, and formal agreements between government (including Tribes) and user groups, the people of this region have worked to protect the natural resources upon which they so greatly depend, while managing increased human activities. The most recent coastal management tool brought to this region is marine spatial planning (MSP). This began with the approval of a state law in 2010 that required the creation of regional non‐regulatory marine spatial plans: “The state intends to augment the marine spatial component of existing plans and to improve the coordination among state agencies in the development and implementation of marine management plans.”1 Spearheaded by a state Senator, this law was established with support from local individuals concerned about the impact offshore renewable energy would have on their fishing activity. The first area for which a marine spatial plan is being completed is the Washington Pacific coast region (see Figure 1). Through the public scoping process, it was determined that the Washington Coast marine spatial plan would have the goal of ensuring “a resilient and healthy marine ecosystem on Washington’s coast that supports sustainable economic, recreational, and cultural opportunities for coastal communities, visitors, and future generations.”2 ​ While the plan is not expected to be completed until the end of 2016, this case study communicates the story to date and presents observations and lessons learned that may be helpful to other coastal management practitioners. Key lessons learned identified through this study are these: the value of understanding the historical context of your place before you begin a plan, the need to manage expectations, and the need to adapt if the issues driving the MSP process cease to be relevant to stakeholders."
