13,Abstract:,"This paper reports on differences in timing, size-​at-​settlement and spatial distribution of two or more 0+ Dungeness crab cohorts within Puget Sound during 1984 through 1988; it is hypothesized that they originated from several geographic stocks of adults. The implications of multiple cohort settlement in relation to year-class survival, growth and recruitment to the fishery are discussed."
