12,Abstract:,"This study had three objectives: first, to assess interspecific priming of various microsatellite primer pairs in Pacific salmon. The authors do this by completing a broad multispecies screening of 35 salmonid microsatellite primer pairs. These primers, developed from six different salmonid taxa, are tested in five species of ""Oncorhynchus"" and ""Salmo salar."" Second, using the screening results, they demonstrate semiautomated multilocus genotyping by multiplexing six microsatellite loci in sockey, coho, and chinook salmon and scoring their alleles with a four-color fluorescent detection system. Finally, they provide an indication of the allelic variability of microsatellites in these salmon. The potential application of multilocus microsatellite genotyping to studies of ""Oncorhynchus"" spp. population structure as well as kinship analysis are discussed."
