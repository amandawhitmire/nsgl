9,Abstract:,"Unintentional exotic species introductions are a threat to marine ecosystems and industries worldwide. These introductions are expected to increase with expanding world trade in live aquatics. The primary goal of the live aquatics industry should be to develop and implement BMPs that address the risk of unintentional species transport. A first step is the identification of products and practices that carry a high risk of inadvertent introductions. Current methods of harvesting, packing, handling, shipping, waste disposal, and marketing of goods should be evaluated and their risks should be assessed. Considering this information, new and cost-effective BMPs would minimize the potential for introductions and their associated ecological and economic ramifications."
