12,Abstract:,"Coastal wetlands play an important role in sequestering atmospheric carbon, but these ecosystems are under threat from sea level rise, land use conversion, and other causes. Restoration projects in coastal wetlands can provide a range of benefits for habitat and ecosystems, including by increasing sequestration of “blue carbon.” Coastal wetland restoration projects that effectively sequester carbon and meet the requirements of the voluntary carbon market can generate tradeable carbon offsets, which have a monetary value and can be used to finance all or part of the restoration needed to generate them. Blue carbon offsets thus represent a promising tool to promote effective restoration and maintenance projects on threatened and degraded coastal wetlands. This study identifies key legal authorities and principles that affect whether and how government land management agencies can participate in blue carbon offset projects. While the principles identified here are applicable to any jurisdiction, this analysis focuses on a selection of federal, state, and tribal agencies and jurisdictions as case studies. These include the federal National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service; the states of Florida, Massachusetts, Washington, and Louisiana; and the Tulalip Tribes of Washington. Legal research applicable to these agencies and jurisdictions identified two primary categories of legal challenges: Title and Property Rights; and Legal Authority."
