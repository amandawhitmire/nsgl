11,Abstract:,"The fields of marine bioremediation (the cleanup of hazardous and toxic wastes by living organisms) and marine extremozymes (the study and use of enzymes extracted from organisms living in extreme environments) are in their infancy; however, bioremediation in the marine environment is still in the exploratory and startup phases. Washington Sea Grant brought together scientists and engineers from around the country to discuss these two emerging and fascinating topics. During a one-and-a-half day workshop held in September 1996 over 130 researchers shared the results and potential ramifications of their work through a series of oral and poster presentations. This proceedings provides summaries of the talks, titles of the posters, and a listing of workshop participants."
