11,Abstract:,"Speciation is the evolutionary process whereby one species separates into two. The speciation event that occurs is intrinsic to the organism that is evolving. However, the speciation process occurs in the environment in which the species lives. So, both the organism and the extrinsic environmental factors play a role in speciation. The extrinsic factors of the environment that affect speciation may include physical, geographical, chemical, and biological factors. These ecological factors not only provide the setting in which speciation occurs, but they comprise the selective force for the speciation process. However, it is the response of the organism to the environmental factors that is the hallmark of speciation. The organism's response takes the form of genetic variation in which mutation and horizontal gene transfer play roles, along with natural selection. In this chapter the author begins by discussing animal and plant speciation followed by bacterial speciation."
