11,Abstract:,"The Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") is among the largest crabs of the Pacific coast of North America, and supports a substantial commercial fishery. Over broad areas of that coast, populations of ""C. magister"" exhibit wide fluctuations, the causes of which are poorly understood. In this study, observations on growth of ""C. magister"" from 19 studies are summarized and synthesized using statistical models. Two growth components (molt increment, MI, and intermolt period, IP) are considered separately and in combination. MI shows slight, but statistically significant variation among studies for both juveniles and adults. There is significant variation in IP among studies. Overall growth is projected using a growth model incorporating temperature influence on IP, demonstrating the potential for wide temperature-â€‹mediated variation in age at reproduction and fishery recruitment."
