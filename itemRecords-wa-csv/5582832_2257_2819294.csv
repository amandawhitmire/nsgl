14,Abstract:,"The planktonic larvae of many marine invertebrates preferentially set in habitats that support growth and reproduction of adults of the species. Chemical cues induce set in many invertebrates including the oysters, ""Crassostrea virginica"" and ""C. gigas"". Researchers have identified a marine bacterium that produces both a molecule (L-DOPA or a DOPA mimetic) that triggers searching behavior by oyster larvae and a polysaccharide adhesive viscous exopolymer, or biofilm, that induces oyster larvae to attach and metamorphose. This bactetium is being tested in oyster hatcheries to enhance larval set and metamorphosis."
