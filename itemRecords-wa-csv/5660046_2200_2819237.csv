10,Abstract:,"A fundamental challenge associated with implementing an ecosystem approach is to create new institutional arrangements that bring together multiple jurisdictional authorities, landowners, resource users and other diverse interests to cooperatively manage natural resource activities. This brief paper outlines a collaborative approach that agencies can use for both internal and external processes to promote cooperation and build partnerships."
