15,Abstract:,"Researchers have established the existence of an orthostatic intolerance during and following an acute exposure to hyperbaric environments in two dives at 31 ATA and one dive at 45 ATA. Whether cardiovascular deconditioning occurs at 3 ATA saturation dives has not been established. In this study, the aim was to ascertain whether or not the same condition existed during a 7-day, 3-ATA nitrox dive over a 15-day period."
