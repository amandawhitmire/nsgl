10,Abstract:,"Numerous specimens of ""Nyctiphanes simplex"", a subtropical neritic euphausiid previously collected only as far north as northern California, were found in plankton collections and stomach contents of pelagic predators collected off Oregon and Washington during spring through fall of 1983 and again in apparently reduced abundances in 1984. These unusual occurrences may have resulted from increased poleward surface and subsurface flows of currents associated with El Nino conditions. Changes in the diet of pelagic predators during 1983 appear to have been associated with these occurrences."
