10,Abstract:,"Empirical models of quota share price often assume a single willingness-​to-​pay for quota at the margin by assuming a well-​functioning market that has converged on a single quota price. This assumption of a single market price follows analytical models developed by (Clark, 1980) among many others to demonstrate how the market price for quota reaches a single price which equals both the shadow price of the resource in situ as well as the marginal profit of quota across each used in many analyses of quota trading to estimate dynamic response to changes in policy (Batstone & Sharp, 2003), the costs associated with trade restrictions (Kroetz et al., 2015) as well as relationship between quota pound price and quota share price (Jin et al., 2019; Newell et al., 2005, 2007)."
