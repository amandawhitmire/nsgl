9,Abstract:,"A small plumb staff beam trawl system was developed for sampling fish and shellfish in shallow coastal waters. Several dives were made to observe it in operation, and compare it with an otter-trawl design that had previously been employed. Day/night comparisons of catch rates and size composition of the catch indicated that the beam trawl performed equally well in daylight and darkness. The plumb staff beam trawl system appears to be a far more effective stock assessment tool than the otter-trawl design that has previously served as a standard in this region."
