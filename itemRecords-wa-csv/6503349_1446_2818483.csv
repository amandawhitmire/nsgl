10,Abstract:,"Ocean acidification (or 'OA') is a long-term decrease in seawater pH that is primarily caused by the ocean's uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide released by fossil fuel combustion, agriculture and deforestation has been building up in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. About a third of that carbon dioxide ends up in the oceans, where it reacts with water molecules to form carbonic acid. As a result, average global ocean pH has already dropped by 0.11 pH units, representing a 29% increase in acidity. If current carbon dioxide emissions trends continue, we will see pH values reach 7.8 to 7.9 by the end of this century-a 100 to 150% increase in acidity!"
