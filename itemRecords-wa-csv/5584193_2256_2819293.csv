10,Abstract:,"The zoeal and megalopal stages of decapods correspond to the developmental (precompetent), and searching (competent) phases, respectively, of invertebrate larvae, and both behaviorally and morphologicallyâ€‹, the megalopal stage is transitional between the plankton and the benthos. Megalopae of the porcelain crabs ""Petrolisthes cinctipes"" and ""P. eriomerus"" Stimpson settle in response to conspecific adults; they do not molt at the time of settlement but rather lose the ability to swim with the pleopods and assume benthic habits similar to those of juveniles, molting to first instar a week or more later. Behavioral observations of megalopae suggested even brief contact with adults could result in this irreversible loss of swimming ability, and also indicated the possibility of an extended competency period. This paper describes experiments conducted to address these issues and the means of attraction for gregarious settlement, and the possible postsettlement benefits of continuing to associate closely with conspecific adults."
