17,Abstract:,"A novel, fully integrated surface plasmon resonance (SPR) transducer is described which is based on the encapsulation of the required electro-optical components within optical material, through a molding process. Prototype sensors based on this approach have been successfully fabricated and tested. Results are shown for sensing of refractive index variations in alcohol solutions. Additionally, the SPR transducer is shown to function as a biological sensor."
