13,Abstract:,"In studying the role of microbial Fe(III) reduction at elevated temperatures, scientists investigated microorganisms associated with a marine hydrothermal vent named 'Bag City' at a new eruption site on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. They report on the isolation and characterizatio​n of a novel thermophilic bacterium which was isolated from diffuse-flow vent fluid from Bag City and which can couple the oxidation of acetate to the reduction of Fe(III) or nitrate. The isolate, designated strain SS015, has an optimal temperature of 55 degrees C and can grow at temperatures as high as 65 degrees C; this isolate represents a novel genus in the family Geobacteraceae. These findings expand the known environmental range of the family Geobacteraceae and suggest that members of this family, which are known to predominate in many cooler Fe(III)-​reducing environments, may also be important Fe(III) reducers in hotter environments."
