10,Abstract:,"The Puget Sound Water Quality Authority has had agenda building as its primary mission. The consensus planning approach it has utilized has led to a plan with a high degree of popular support, achieved in some cases through the abandonment of highly divisive issues. The Authority has become increasingly proactive, however, as it has moved from consolidating gains made in other water quality programs on behalf of Puget Sound to developing new initiatives aimed at problems little addressed in the past. Recent events suggest that the consensus strategy pursued by the Authority may be leaving it vulnerable to attack from industry groups previously not heard from. The goal-directed, comprehensive, synoptic approach implicit in many water quality planning models must adapt to strategic policy-making. The agenda-building process will reflect the balance achieved between the two. This paper details the interplay between these approaches in the development of the comprehensive water quality management program now being implemented for Puget Sound."
