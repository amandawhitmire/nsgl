9,Abstract:,"In the Pisum sativum L. cv. Lance (garden pea)/Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi and phaseoli interactions, F. solani f. sp. pisi is a true pathogen of pea and F. solani f. sp. phaseoli is a pathogen of bean but not of pea, where the bean pathogen stimulates a non-host reaction in pea allowing for the study of host and non-host resistance. Chapter One discusses an inhibitor/effec​tor array approach to uncovering additional vital cellular processes involved in non- host resistance. Fungal growth, hypersensitive discoloration, and pisatin accumulation were monitored in the presence of these inhibitor/effec​tors. The initial analysis indicated that protein phosphatase inhibitors and protein kinase inhibitors influenced pisatin production more than the other inhibitor/effec​tors and also mimic some of the effects induced by the two Fusaria. The DNA damage assays in pea endocarp tissue treated with the inhibitors and fungal pathogens, from with DNA was extracted, associated minor DNA fragmentation with the phosphatase inhibitors shown in Chapter 1, Figure 5. High mobility group (HMG) proteins are found in the nuclei of eukaryotic organisms where they play a role in transcriptional regulation. In this study the tissue employed to investigate HMG A is P. sativum L. cv. Lance pea pods. Phosphorylation of HMG A detected directly with P32 labeling in pea pods is addressed in Chapter Two, Part One following treatments with the protein phosphatase inhibitors, calyculin A, okadaic acid, cantharidin and endothall, and the kinase inhibitor K252a. In this study pea HMG A was labeled in vivo with P32 and in combination with F, solani f. sp. phaseoli and pisi inoculum or inhibitor treatments. There were differences in the degree of phosphorylation relative to the treatments. In Chapter Two, Part Two the isolation and purification of HMG A from pea pods by isoelectric focusing was found to be a valuable tool to aid in the characterizatio​n of HMG A. Protein extracts containing HMG A were separated based on their isoelectric focusing point. The HMG A proteins were focused into two fractions with good purity and concentration."
