13,Abstract:,"Connecting science with education through technology and real or near time data provides outreach opportunities for researchers and local relevance and excitement for teachers and students. Using information from the South Atlantic Bight coastal observation systems (SEACOOS and CARO-COOPS) is a challenge requiring new collaboration among scientists and educators, new strategies and new models of engagement"
