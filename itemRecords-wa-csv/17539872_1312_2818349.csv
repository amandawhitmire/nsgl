13,Abstract:,"Salmonid ecology and conservation projects often necessitatedist​inguishing the offspring from anadromous or nonanadromousmo​thers, but the forms are often physically and genetically similar.We reared Oncorhynchus mykiss fry produced by anadromousmothe​rs on one of two diets: one rich in and the otherdepleted in marine nutrients. We then sampled and analyzed finand muscle tissues from fish fed both diets for nitrogen stable isotopesover time. Tissue nitrogen values from fish on the marinenutrient-​depleted diet indicated the size and time cutoffs at whichoffspring of anadromous O. mykiss no longer reflected a marineorigin (muscle tissue cutoff: 0.81 g, 50.8 mm, and 29.4 d postfeeding;fin tissue cutoff: 0.65 g, 45.9 mm, and 35.3 d). Salmonidssmalle​r than 50 mm cannot provide a sufficiently large fin samplefor isotopic analysis without significant risk of mortality. Therefore,our experiment did not reveal a period when fish were largeenough to provide a nonlethal fin clip but still maintain theirmaternal nitrogen isotope signature. However, fish growingslower than those we examined would likely be distinguishable​for a longer period of time than our data indicated."
