12,Abstract:,"Steelhead, Chinook and coho salmon, and piscivorous birds caught during the summer, 2008, research operations of the R/V Wakatake maru were screened for the presence of a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag using a hand-held detector. One PIT-tagged steelhead was found from among the 329 fish and 68 seabirds scanned. The steelhead was tagged in April, 2006, as a smolt in the Snake River of the Columbia River Basin, USA. This PIT tag detection demonstrates the feasibility of scanning immature and maturing salmonids during on-deck processing operations of high seas salmonid research cruises. The routine use of a PIT tag detector during high-seas cruises holds the potential to generate new information from tag detections of wild and hatchery fish, which could significantly increase our knowledge of the ocean distribution of steelhead, and other salmon that originate from areas where fish are routinely PIT-tagged prior to or during their freshwater out-migration."
