10,Abstract:,"Stable carbon isotopes were used to elucidate the seasonal origins and fates of different organic carbon sources in Puget Sound estuaries. Stable carbon isotope analysis was chosen because high riverine inputs of terrestrial carbon in fall and winter may produce a distinct, seasonally-​pulsed, 13C depleted signature separable from enriched estuarine and nearshore marine autochthonous carbon. Primary objectives were to: (1) intensively sample 13C of carbon sources and consumer organisms within estuarine and nearshore marine food webs; and (2) determine the seasonal isotopic composition of carbon sources and consumers in the different habitats."
