11,Abstract:,"The role of thyroid hormones in control of the early development of reptiles and fishes is not well understood. There is a large body of indirect evidence which suggests that thyroid hormones regulate development of fish embryos and larvae. To establish that the thyroid is involved in control of the early development of fishes it is necessary, but not sufficient, to demonstrate that thyroid hormones are present in the blood at early developmental stages. To that end, the blood plasma concentrations of thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-​triiodo-​L-​thyronine (T3) in developing embryos of five species of salmon were evaluated."
