6,Abstract:,"The National Sea Grant Fellows Program/Dean John A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship was established in 1979 to provide a unique educational experience to students who have an interest in ocean and Great Lakes resources and in the national policy affecting those resources.The program, sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration'​s National Sea Grant College Program, matches highly-​qualified graduate students with ""hosts"" in the Legislative Branch, the Executive Branch, or appropriate associations/in​stitutions located in the Washington, D.C., area for a one -year paid fellowship. Dr. Ned A. Ostenso, a former director of the National Sea Grant College Program, pioneered the establishment of what was then known as the Sea Grant Intern Program. Dr. Ostenso continued to nurture this program in his subsequent position as Assistant Administrator of NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research from which he retired in January 1996. During Dr. Ostenso's tenure, the Intern Program was later codified by an Act of Congress and renamed the Dean John A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship in honor of Dr. John Knauss, one of the founders of Sea Grant and a former NOAA Administrator. This internship directory is for the years 1979-1997."
