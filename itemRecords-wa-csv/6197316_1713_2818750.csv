11,Abstract:,"The cellular exterior that a microbe presents to its surroundings marks its first line of defense against environmental pressures that range from energy deprivation and other extreme conditions, including ionic and thermal stress, to viral and higher- order attack. The production of exopolymers, whether to provide an immediate individual coating of multiple functions or to be freely released and shared by other organisms in consortial arrangements or biofilm formations, is a hallmark of microbial life in soil, water, and host (plant and animal)-â€‹associated environments. The basic features of exopolymers and their functions pertain to all manner of environments and microbial adaptation, largely independently of ambient temperature. At extreme temperatures, however, where phase changes come into play, special considerations arise. In this chapter, we pay particular attention to the small-scale physics and chemistry of the behavior of exopolymers at low temperatures, and specifically within the sea-ice matrix where multiple phases are present in the space of a microbe, influencing its ability to survive. The study of exopolymers and cold adaptation in ice still represents a largely unexplored frontier, so other literature is tapped, including that for biofilms, polymers, the food industry, and medicine."
