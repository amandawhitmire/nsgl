13,,"The genetic population structure of geoduck clams (""Panopea abrupta"") in inland waters of Washington may affect fishery management and aquacultural practices involving this species. To investigate genetic differentiation in geoduck clams, samples were collected from 16 Washington State sites located in the five Puget Sound sub basins, southern Georgia Strait, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. A collection from Clarence Strait in SE Alaska was included as an outgroup. Individuals were genotyped at 11 allozyme and 7 microsatellite loci. There was little differentiation overall, but the Freshwater Bay collection in the Strait of Juan de Fuca was differentiated from others at both microsatellite and allozyme loci. For both marker classes, there was no evidence of significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance measures. In contrast to the microsatellite loci, the allozyme loci were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). Deviations from HWE expectations at microsatellite loci were interpreted as being primarily due to primer-site sequence variation rather than population level processes such as inbreeding."
