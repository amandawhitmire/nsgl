10,Abstract:,"If you work in an educational, research, or testing facility that receives and handles shipments of live, fresh, frozen, or air-dried aquatic specimens, you could be introducing non-native species into your local environment. Such shipments often harbor unwanted organisms that can be inadvertently released into local waters. This booklet describes preventive measures such as identifying potential risks to local ecosystems, assessing whether a facility might provide a pathway for introduction of non-native aquatic species, and standard protocols for handling and disposal of non-native aquatic species and their packaging. Although written for workers in the Pacific Northwest, much of the content is applicable anywhere."
