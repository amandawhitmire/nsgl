16,Abstract:,"In immature fish ovary, nutritional stress reduces body size and ovarian growth and induced atresia and disrupts the endocrine systems controlling growth and reproduction. Steroidgenesis-​related genes and some TGF--β superfamily genes were expressed low in fasted fish ovary. Apoptosis related genes were expressed high in fasted fish ovary. Genes revealed in this study may be good genomic markers of ovarian growth versus atresia."
