11,Abstract:,"Port pricing in North America often owes more to politics and to artistry than to repeatable scientific logic. Even when the pricing process seems to be carefully thought out, a concentration on internal factors, a neglect of external factors or a tendency to adopt a 'short run' time frame may bring unwanted results. To shed light upon an arena which seems to be constantly in the shadows. This paper offers an overview and a guide to effective port pricing practices based on U.S. and Canadian observations. A major challenge for public port authorities in the 1990s will be to act more like businesses. For some Ports, this means adopting more carefully constructed pricing policies."
