9,Abstract:,"Methods for the prevention and treatment of Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD), a significant systemic bacterial disease of salmonids, are reviewed with particular emphasis on the use of erythromycin compounds to prevent BKD episodes in North America and Europe. Topics addressed specifically are the significance of BKD in salmonid fisheries; an historical overview of antibiotic feeding methods used to prevent or control BKD; the use of salt and surfactant bath treatments with erythromycin phosphate (E-P04); the use of E-PO4 injections of adult salmonids; the use of E-PO4 as an egg water hardening agent; and suggestions for future studies."
