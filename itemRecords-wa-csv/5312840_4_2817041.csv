12,Abstract:,"This document is a report on the Connecticut Sea Grant Program for the period of July 1, 1983 to June 30, 1984. Change continues to be the order of the day at Avery Point. The decision to move toward a major marine center for education and research was made early in 1984. This decision has resulted in the creation of five State-​funded positions which are now being advertised, and a sizeable commitment for capital improvements. With the creation of the Northeast Center of the National Undersea Research Program at Avery Point in May and the commitment to an expanded and modified Marine Sciences Institute, in addition to Connecticut Sea Grant, the overall program is clearly starting to move forward. During the 1983-84 budget year, the Sea Grant program continued the two research projects on hard clam growth and oyster management which had started in 1982. In this second year of the Connecticut Sea Grant Program, we have moved much closer to NOAA and the National Sea Grant College Program, both in terms of our understanding of what Washington expects of us and in terms of their understanding of our present capabilities and future plans for Avery Point. These plans received an enormous lift from the discussions held in May between the leadership of NOAA and the University. With respect to the Connecticut Sea Grant Program, we wish to express our thanks to the National Office of Sea Grant for many hours of effort and endless patience in helping us to move toward mutual goals."
