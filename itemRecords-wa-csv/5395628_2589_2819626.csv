13,Abstract:,"In this paper, the authors estimate gene-centromere recombination rates for 25 enzyme loci and compare these rates in females from four different strains of rainbow trout. Gene-centromere recombination rates are also estimated in triploids (created by induced retention of the second polar body after fertilization with active sperm) to test the possibility that the high proportion of heterozygotes at some loci is due to reduced survival of homozygotes. Results indicate that this is not the case."
