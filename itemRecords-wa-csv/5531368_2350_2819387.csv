12,Abstract:,"Chitosan is a component of the fungal walls of many fungi, including ""Fusarium solani."" Chitosan has been implicated as a regulatory component in the ""Pisum sativum-​Fusarium solani"" host-pathogen interaction. This study examined the biological activity and actual polymer sizes of chitosan produced from the plant-fungus interaction or produced from the deacetylation of chitin synthesized by the pathogen. A biologically active chitosan oligomer (heptamer or larger) was recovered from the fungi."
