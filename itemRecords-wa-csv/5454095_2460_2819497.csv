10,Abstract:,"The caulobacters are members of the prosthecate or appendaged group of bacteria. During their life cycle these bacteria alternate between a monoflagellated​, rod-shaped cell (swarmer) and a nonmotile cell which has a stalk. The bacterium has been studied as a model system to understand differentiation processes in bacteria, because of the distinctive changes in morphology and the elaboration of organelles at specific positions on the cell and at predictable times during the life cycle. Here a total of 25 marine caulobacters were isolated from littoral marine sources. Several aspects of their physiology and morphology were examined, as well as their suitability for genetic manipulation in laboratory cultivation."
