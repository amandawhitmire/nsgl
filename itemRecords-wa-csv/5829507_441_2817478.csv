10,Abstract:,"Canada and the U.S. share a common estuarine resource which encompasses the inland seas of Puget Sound (all U. S. waters), the Straits of Georgia (largely Canadian waters), and the Straits of Juan de Fuca (shared). The inland waters connect with the Pacific Ocean via the Straits of Juan de Fuca to the west and to the north through the Strait of Georgia, Washington. In 1993 six scientists from British Columbia and Washington were appointed to examine environmental conditions in the shared inland marine waters. The BC/WA Marine Science Panel (MSP) included scientists from three universities, two federal agencies, and a private consulting firm. The state and province charged the MSP with answering specific questions dealing with transboundary pollution, the threatened condition of living marine resources, and the projected impacts of rapid growth on habitats and marine resources. Their findings are discussed here."
