16,Abstract:,"The amnesic shellfish poison domoic acid is produced by marine algae of the genus Pseudo-​nitzschia. We have developed a portable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor system for the detection of domoic acid. Because of concerns with domoic acid contamination of shellfish, there is a need for rapid field quantification of toxin levels in both shellfish and seawater. Antibodies were raised against domoic acid and affinity purified. These antibodies were used to develop competition- and displacement-​based assays using a portable six-channel SPR system developed in our laboratories. Standard curves for detection of domoic acid in phosphate buffered saline and in diluted clam extracts analyzed by the competition-​based SPR assay demonstrated a limit of detection of 3 ppb (10 nM) and a quantifiable range from 4 to 60 ppb (13-200 nM). Comparison of analyses for domoic acid levels in Pacific razor clams, Siliqua patula, containing moderate to high levels of domoic acid by the standard HPLC analysis protocol and the SPR-based assay gave an excellent correlation. This same technology should also function for detection of domoic acid in concentrated algal extracts or high dissolved levels in seawater."
