7,Abstract:,"The development of good farm stock-​traditionally has been a lengthy, hit or-miss process. The chickens in your freezer,-​for example, are the product of nearly 3,000 years of domestication..​ With the help of the Washington Sea Grant Program, salmon farmers hope to duplicate the same process — transforming a wild animal to a tamed food source — in just a few decades. Through selective breeding, Sea Grant researchers and private aquaculturists have been able to triple the growth rates of native coho salmon."
