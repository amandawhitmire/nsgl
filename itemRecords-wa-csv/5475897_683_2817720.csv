12,Abstract:,"This workshop report reflects the viewpoint that the state of knowledge should have a more prominent and explicit role in the identification, prioritization, and selection of environmental research concerning offshore oil and gas funded by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Since about 1978, MMS has applied study selection criteria that are quite mission-​oriented within the legal framework of federal laws and court decisions applicable to the agency. Consideration of the state of knowledge within the field of environmental and socioeconomic studies has been largely a matter of internal, subjective evaluation by the staff and advisory committees of MMS. Nevertheless, it has functioned as an informal, unwritten criterion and is a continuing source of frustration and dissension within the leasing process. To address the situation, Washington Sea Grant sponsored this workshop to provide a forum where scientists and research managers in government, industry, and academia could begin to systematize their thoughts on the currently dominant concepts in this field."
