10,Abstract:,"The petroleum industry may be coming to Washington's outer continental shelf (OCS) in the 1990s. This book begins with background information on the federal OCS leasing process, the oil industry, and oil in the marine environment. It then describes the geology, meteorology, oceanography, birds, mammals, and fisheries of Washington coastal waters. Without making predictions, it analyzes how those resources might be affected by offshore development; potential socioeconomic impacts of the offshore industry are analyzed as well. The book neither advocates nor opposes offshore oil and gas development, and does not compare such development with other energy alternatives. It was designed to provide the state with information to prepare for federal leasing of the OCS scheduled for 1992."
