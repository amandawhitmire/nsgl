15,Abstract:,"Seaweed aquaculture is a relatively young industry in the United States compared to Asian countries. Early attempts at seaweed aquaculture in California, Washington State, New York and the Gulf of Maine in the 1980s and 1990s did not result in commercial production but provided important lessons. Since 2010, commercial cultivation of kelp (Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata, and Alaria esculenta) and other seaweeds (Palmaria palmata and Por​phyra umbilicalis) began in the Gulf of Maine and Long Island Sound. Seaweed aquaculture is now a fast-growing maritime industry, especially in New England. If seaweed aquaculture is to maintain its momentum, it is important to (1) emphasise the environmental benefits; (2) domesticate a variety of local species; and (3) diversify seaweed products for food, animal feed, phycocolloids, cosmeceuticals, nutraceuticals, and ultimately biofuels if it becomes economically viable due to the cost of production. The exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the United States offers opportunities for expansion of seaweed aquaculture in an area greater than the entire land mass of the United States and with limited user conflicts. This study reviews the past and current status of seaweed aquaculture in the United States and discusses potential opportunities and challenges of open-water seaweed aquaculture."
