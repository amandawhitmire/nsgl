11,Abstract:,"This report summarizes results of research on the 1995 sockeye fishery, the first year of a two year study, on gear modifications and fishery practices intended to eliminate or significantly reduce the incidental capture of seabirds in drift gillnet fisheries. The objectives were: (1) to determine the relative entanglement rates of seabirds in gillnets modified to reduce seabird bycatch and determine relative entanglements rates among times of day, as well as (2) to determine the relative fishing efficiency of gear modified to reduce seabird bycatch. The report provides a detailed summary of fishing effort; seabird and marine mammal observations during fishing activities; and salmon catch, seabird entanglements and marine mammal entanglements by gear type, time-of-day, and location."
