11,Abstract:,"A worldwide continuing effort aimed at the enhanced utilization of shellfish waste as a source of chitin and chitosan is being maintained. Applications where high-quality or priced chitosan is recommended, but only a relatively small amount of material is needed, may transform a small physical achievement into a large financial success. This can be capable of generating the cash flow required to sustain a fledgling company that manufactures chitosan products. An example of this philosophy is the development of the wound-healing and disposable chitosan-based contact lens. Bicomponent structures can be prepared by coating commercially available fibers with a film of chitosan. The current work assesses the processability of polypropylene into bicomponent fibers by dynamic wettability measurements."
