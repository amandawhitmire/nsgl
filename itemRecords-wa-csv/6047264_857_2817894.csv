10,Abstract:,"Invasive species can radically alter the landscape and crowd out native plants and animals-a problem that costs the United States more than $100 billion each year. Washington State wrestles with dozens of aquatic invasive species including several cordgrasses in the genus ""Spartina S. alterniflora"" was introduced into Willapa Bay about 100 years ago and has colonized over 6,000 hectares of previously unvegetated mudflats (Davis et al. 2004). ""S. alterniflora"" presents an unusual challenge for land managers because it is remarkably versatile and resilient. It is capable of establishing in different habitat types, an uncommon feature among march plants; it is also very effective at producing and dispersing seeds and resisting mechanical removal by storing a reserve of nutrients in large underground root masses. This booklet describes ""S. angelica's"" ecology and it is aimed at uncovering the most important factors in developing a control strategy. It describes the results of manipulative experiments that tease apart the timing of seed production and germination as well as physical factors that most contribute to ""S. angelica's"" success. This booklet also links data from previous control efforts by the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) with the basic physiology of the plant and makes recommendations for developing future management plans. Lessons learned from work with ""S. angelica"" often may apply to control of invasive ""S. alterniflora"" because of similarities in the biology of these two species."
