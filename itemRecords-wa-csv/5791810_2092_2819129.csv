16,Abstract:,"The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon can be used to measure the refractive index of a wide variety of chemical samples. Such a refractive-​index determination may be utilized as a process-control and/or monitoring tool in chemical systems which can be qualified by an acceptable refractive-​index window. An optical tabletop system based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for refractive-​index determination has been developed to demonstrate the feasibility of a miniaturized and integrated concept which is also described. The components utilized in the tabletop system are consistent with the development of a low-cost miniature integrated surface plasmon sensor. Such a device has been constructed. A sketch of a minisensor is shown, along with preliminary response data."
