12,Abstract:,"Culture operations for the introduced Japanese oyster, ""Crassostrea gigas,"" now cover vast areas of intertidal landscape, particularly thalassinid shrimp for more than 30 years. Field experiments were conducted to examine the effects of these habitat modifications on the benthic community in Willapa Bay. Results indicated that the primary long-term effect of carbaryl application was removal of the two species of thalassinid shrimp that dominated the community at the start of the experiment and Clearly influenced community composition. The authors also discuss the impacts, both of oyster culture and carbaryl, on amphipods, molluscs, polychaetes, and the infaunal community."
