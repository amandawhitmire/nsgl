13,,"The drainage basin of the Columbia River encompasses seven states as well as British Columbia. Flow at the mouth of this mighty river averages 123 million gallons per minute. It is used extensively for hydroelectric power, irrigation, transportation, municipal water, flood control, fishing, recreation, tourism and wildlife conservation. But now it can no longer meet all the demands placed on it. A myriad of special interest groups and committees compete for allocations. Authority is fragmented among dozens of state, regional, federal and international agencies. Vital public policy choices must soon be made. The purpose of the conference documented here was to ascertain how users perceived the river's development and envisioned its future. Major sections are devoted to who runs the river now, how it is run, who wants the water, and what has been learned in the past. There is also an address by Senator Mark Hatfield concerned with the need for a national water policy."
