12,Abstract:,"The multi-agency Puget Sound Dredge Disposal Analysis Program has been delegated the task of evaluating, selecting, monitoring and managing sites within the inland waters of Washington State for long-term, unconfined disposal of uncontaminated dredged materials. The Disposal Site Work Group was assigned the responsibility of selecting unconfined, open water disposal sites in Puget Sound based on nineteen selection factors covering physical parameters, human uses, historical biological resource data and site-specific trawl investigations. This document is one of two final technical reports detailing the results of the site-specific trawl surveys for disposal sites located in north and south Puget Sound. The results of invertebrate resource assessments using a 3-m beam trawl are contained in this report."
