11,Abstract:,"In the current study, the authors report on the DNA fragmentation typically observed during programmed cell death following the inoculation of pea tissue with ""Fusarium"" pathogens. They also used various heterologous probes to further clarify the possible homology of animal p53 with a functional gene in plant systems. Although DNA fragmentation characteristic of endonucleolytic degradation was observed following inoculation, a strict p53 homolog was not detectable in pea plants using heterologous probes and PCR as tools to identify homologous sequences. Furthermore, the high mol. wt. pea protein that co-migrated with the maize protein formerly considered to be p53- related did not share the inductive characteristics of animal p53 in those tissues where it was present."
