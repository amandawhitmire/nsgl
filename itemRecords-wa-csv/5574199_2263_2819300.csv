10,Abstract:,"Hood Canal is a clear, deep fjord that knifes 60 miles into the edge of the Olympic Mountains of Washington state. Early settlers found abundant wildlife and acres of timber to exploit, never realizing that their efforts were snipping apart an intricate web of life, one strand at a time. Today, the ecosystem formed by Hood Canal and its watershed, stretching into Olympic National Park, may have reached the threshold. Small events take their toll, along with the everyday activities of residents. When an ecosystem is pristine, relatively easy steps can be taken to preserve it. When an ecosystem is destroyed, the task of bringing it back is often too complex and too costly to be attempted. But the real challenge is to save an ecosystem that is teetering on the brink--one that's still basically sound but faces a threat. That's when we learn about how to fit our human lifestyles into a natural system. Learning that lesson is the challenge of Hood Canal today. This book, most of whose text appeared in a series of newspaper articles, describes the Hood Canal's past, present and uncertain future; numerous photographs adorn the text."
