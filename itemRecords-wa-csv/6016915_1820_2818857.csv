12,Abstract:,"The Pacific cod (""Gadus macrocephalus"") supports large commercial fisheries in the northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea. Here the authors characterize 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci isolated from enriched genomic libraries. Loci were screened on a sample of 96 spawning adults. The average number of alleles per locus was 25.3 (range 12�44), with expected heterozygositie​s (HE) ranging from 0.54 to 0.97. No significant deviations of genotypic proportions from Hardy�Weinberg equilibrium or linkage equilibrium were detected. These markers will be used in future studies of population structure and mixed stock analysis of this important gadid species."
