11,Abstract:,"This illustrated 20-page booklet is an introduction to non- native species, their interactions with the natural environment, and the factors that affect bio-invasions, including pathways, barriers, and habitat alteration. It explains how species are transported from one geographic region to another and why some survive and thrive while others don't. The impacts of intentional and accidental introductions are discussed, and suggestions are given on how to prevent the introduction and spread of unwanted non- native species. Two species are looked at in detail: the European green crab and the zebra mussel."
