12,Abstract:,"A methanogenic archaeon isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent fluid was found to reduce N2 to NH3 at up to 92 deg. C, which is 28 deg. C higher than the current upper temperature limit of biological nitrogen fixation. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the hyperthermophil​ic nitrogen fixer, designated FS406-22, was 99% similar to that of non-nitrogen fixing Methanocaldococ​cus jannaschii DSM 2661. At its optimal growth temperature of 90 deg. C, FS406-22 incorporated 15N2 and expressed nifH messenger RNA. This increase in the temperature limit of nitrogen fixation could reveal a broader range of conditions for life in the subseafloor biosphere and other nitrogen- limited ecosystems than previously estimated."
