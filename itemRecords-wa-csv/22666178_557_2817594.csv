9,Abstract:,"What to do when you find marine debris? As a boater, you may encounter anything from plastic trash and derelict fishing gear to floating logs. All are potential hazards to navigation. Help keep our waters safe: Safely pick up ordinary trash, which includes things like plastic bottles, fishing line and bags. Use common sense: Don’t pick up anything sharp, awkward to lift, or that appears to be a hazardous. Please report debris that you can’t pick up."
