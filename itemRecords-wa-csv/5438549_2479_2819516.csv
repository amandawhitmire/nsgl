9,Abstract:,"The seafood and aquacultural products industry has been affected by both internal (technological) advances and external (social) changes (e.g., increased consumer income, greater labor force commitment of married women). The focus of this paper is on the external changes and their impact on food and seafood consumption away from home. Econometric models depicting how `eating out' patterns vary across U.S. subgroups are developed and analyzed; the significance of selected factors is assessed. Resulting estimates are used to calculate elasticities (total and decomposed) with respect to income, household size, and value of household time. The relevance of these decomposed elasticity estimates for the food service and seafood industry is discussed."
