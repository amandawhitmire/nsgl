10,Abstract:,"Increases in population and ferry traffic in western Washington require expansion of existing terminals, threatening the ecological functions of existing eelgrass (""Zostera marina"" L.) meadows. Eelgrass meadows are affected by light reduction and other initial and long-term disturbances associated with terminal construction and maintenance, propeller wash, and bioturbation by macroinvertebra​tes. Technological mitigation measures showed that concrete blocks with clear plastic centers, reflective material placed under terminals, and artificial lighting can all enhance light under the terminals. Restoration of damaged meadows adjacent to terminals is proposed as an alternative."
