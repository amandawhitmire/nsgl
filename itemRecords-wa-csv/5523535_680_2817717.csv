11,Abstract:,"Information on ways to reduce the loss of fish resulting from noxious phytoplankton blooms has been identified as the top research need of the net-pen salmon farming industry, which took devastating losses during the summer of 1989. The mortalities resulted from an uncommon bloom of the dinoflagellate ""Heterosigma akashiwo."" Previous losses of salmon to phytoplankton blooms in Washington were caused primarily by the diatom ""Chaetoceros convolutus"" or ""C. concavicornis."" With a sense of urgency, a workshop was convened to provide salmon farmers with essential background information regarding blooms, species, and mitigation methods on an international level. At the same time, a Washington Sea Grant project plan to research the problem was discussed with growers in order to cement a cooperative and standardized field effort. This report outlines the proceedings of the workshop."
