11,Abstract:,"It is well known that what are called ""far field"" tsunamis impact the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Indeed, tsunami waves propagating into Port Angeles Harbor in the central Strait of Juan de Fuca were documented after the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011. Certainly within the academic and emergency management community it is also well known that the Strait of Juan de Fuca is at risk from potentially catastrophic ""near field"" tsunamis that are generated near to our coast. In particular a so-called ""mega-thrust"" earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone could generate a large and potentially catastrophic earthquake and tsunami that could impact much of the Pacific Northwest coast. As a result, entities like the Washington Emergency Management Department are very focused on tsunami education and risk reduction throughout the coastal areas of Washington State, including along the Strait of Juan de Fuca."
