10,Abstract:,"It is easy to forget that bird conservation often comes down to habitat. If a species is threatened, odds are good it is running up against a bottleneck in critical habitat for mating, nesting, or feeding. A big problem with habitat alteration is that effects can be gradual and difficult to link to cause. So, even though conservation-â€‹minded folks would never pour motor oil down the drain, the same awareness doesn't necessarily extend to rearranging habitat. This is the case with Puget Sound's increasingly modified shorelines, such as seawalls or riprap (known as armoring). Depending on closeness to urban areas, it can be difficult to find natural shorelines; currently one-third of all Puget Sound shorelines are engineered or modified."
