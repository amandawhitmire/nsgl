11,Abstract:,"Maritime commerce plays a central role in the economic life of the Puget Sound region. The ports contribute to the economic health of the region and during the recent recession have often appeared to be an invaluable source of stability. However, port development and expansion can affect areas with significant ecological value for the natural environment and reduce space available for recreational and aesthetic use. ln this context there has been discussion about the extent to which ports can be expected to expand in the future in terms both of tonnages handled and of land utilized. Specifically, suggestions have been made that Puget Sound is well suited for the development of one or more ""super-ports"" capable of handling the largest deep-draft bulk cargo vessels now being built. In the first section we derive and present a range of projections of traffic tonnages through Puget Sound ports up to the year 2000, broken down by commodity classifications and with separate totals for the major ports of Seattle, Tacoma and Everett. Part II discusses the land area requirements of port-related commerce, including the demand for land in industrial parks adjacent to terminal facilities but not necessarily providing direct access to the water. In Part III (A) the causes and consequences of circumstances in which port-area land is in relatively plentiful supply are analyzed and the effects of public subsidization of port districts on their investment patterns are discussed. Part​ III (B) begins with an attempt to clarify existing usage of the term ""super-​port,"" then proceeds to assess the necessity and desirability of this type of development, with special reference to the Nisqually Delta area and to the Port of Everett's plans for Jetty Island."
