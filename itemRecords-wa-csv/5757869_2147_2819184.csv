12,Abstract:,"The nonhost disease resistance response (DRR) in plants is associated with the rapid production of a number of proteins, many of which are likely to be involved in preventing a successful pathogen attack. The authors previously described the isolation of a number of cDNA clones representing DRR transcripts that rapidly accumulate after inoculation of pea pod tissue with spores of the bean pathogen ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli."" Expression of one of these clones, p1206 (DRR206-a), was shown to be induced to high, sustained levels very early in the successful resistance response to ""F. solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli."" The nucleotide sequence of the genomic clone DRR206-d reported here is identical to the p1206 (DRR206-a) cDNA clone sequence with the exception of a single conservative change in the coding region and five base differences. These differences are most likely due to allelic variation resulting from the use of different pea cultivars to isolate the cDNA and genomic clones."
