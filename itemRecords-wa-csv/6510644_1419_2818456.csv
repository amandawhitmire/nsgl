10,,"In the early 1990s, nutrients in aquaculture effluent waters came under increasing regulatory scrutiny because of their role in stimulating unwanted algal and aquatic plant growth in public waterways. As a result, a number of states developed regulations that restrict the amount of phosphorus, nitrogen, and fecal solids that are allowed in the discharge water of freshwater fish culture facilities. At the time, these new regulations threatened to dramatically reduce production by the trout industry."
