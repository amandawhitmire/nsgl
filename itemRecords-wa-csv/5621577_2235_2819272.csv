12,Abstract:,"This video demonstrates a method of force-feeding small first feeding fish larvae. The technique involves micro-injection of diets into the gut of an anesthetized and immobilized larva in a petri dish under a dissecting microscope. The method is appropriate for studying the effects of different diet types, nutrients, nutrient forms, and physiological states on nutrient assimiliation. The method may also be useful in studies of toxicology, cell cycles, and basic developmental physiology."
