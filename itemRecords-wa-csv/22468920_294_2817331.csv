11,Abstract:,"Welcome. Thank you for your work to help protect Washington’s shorelines!As a volunteer monitor, you will conduct two types of survey tomonitor pocket estuaries in Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan deFuca and the San Juan Islands for invasion by European greencrab (Carcinus maenas): trapping and shoreline surveys. The CrabTeam staff at Washington Sea Grant (WSG) has identified sitesthat are thought to be at highest risk of invasion based on habitatsuitabil​ity. To increase the chances that we will detect green crab at the earliest possible stages of invasioninto inland Washington waters, monitors will:● work with a team of 3-5 monitors at an assigned site,● conduct monthly surveys from April through September of each year,● submit data to WSG within a week of completing surveys, and● notify WSG immediately upon finding evidence of green crab presence.We will increase monitoring at sites where green crab have been positively identified to determine whethercrabs are successfully establishing at that site, and how they are affecting other organisms in the community."
