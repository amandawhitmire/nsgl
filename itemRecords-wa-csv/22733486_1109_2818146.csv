13,Abstract:,"Olympic Coast tribes have depended on local marine species for their livelihoods, food security and cultural practices for thousands of years. Today, these species—and the indigenous communities that depend on them—are at risk from ocean acidification. Olympic coast tribes, federal and academic scientists, and marine resource managers are working together to understand and plan for the impacts of ocean change to tribal community well-being. This collaborative investigation and project video were funded by the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program; project partners include the Hoh Tribe, Quileute Tribe, Quinault Indian Nation, Makah Tribe, Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary, Olympic National Park, NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Lab, UW Applied Physics Lab, UW CICOES (formerly ‘JISAO’), and the University of Connecticut."
