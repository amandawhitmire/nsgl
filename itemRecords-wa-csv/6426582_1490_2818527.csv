12,Abstract:,"Chronic shoreline erosion of the mixed sand and gravel Elwha River delta has been attributed to the emplacement of two dams in the first quarter of the 20th century. The corollary of this assumptions is that the contemporary removal of the two dams might halt or even reverse erosion. In order to support the development of conceptual and numerical models of delta and shoreline response to dam removal, we undertook an investigation to measure delta shoreface and volumetric changes using annually collected shoreline topography and bathmetry data."
