12,Abstract:,"Recruitment variability is a central problem in fishery sciences and a major source of uncertainty in fisheries management. Recruitment variability of Dungeness crab, ""Cancer magister"", has been explained by statistical relationships between landings (as a proxy for planktonic larval abundance years prior) and physical variables. Processes involving predation and cannibalism also have been suggested as determinants of Dungeness crab recruitment. This paper shows that the first cohrt of YOY Dungeness crabs to settle annually in shell habitat may control survival and abundance of subsequent cohorts of settling megalopae by either cannibalism or other yet untested processes of competition or conspecific avoidance."
