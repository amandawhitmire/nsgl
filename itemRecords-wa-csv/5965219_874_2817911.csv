14,Abstract:,"Scientists used three techniques (temperature loggers, stable isotopes, fluorescence) to assess the relative amounts of oceanic and freshwater resources reaching sites throughout Willapa Bay, Washington. They hypothesized that spatial and temporal variation in delivery of these resources determines benthic secondary production of suspension feeders. Estuarine gradients associated with the quality and quantity of food, rather than, for instance, temperature or salinity, would affect suspension feeder growth. They tested the hypothesis by measuring the growth of Pacific oysters transplanted to multiple sites within the Bay. Traditionally, oysters growers have moved oysters from southern parts of the bay where recruitment is relatively high to beds closer to the mouth where market- size oysters can be grown. This study's results provide mechanistic support for these practices and suggest that climatic events on a variety of temporal scales (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, upwelling events) could have economic consequences for aquaculture."
