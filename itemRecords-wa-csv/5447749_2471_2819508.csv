8,Abstract:,"Plastic trash in the ocean is a hazard to wildlife and human safety. Last year, Congress passed the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act, which bans disposal of plastic trash in the ocean. This marine advisory publication details the components of the new law and its potential effects on the boater, port manager and fisherman. It also includes sections on regional marine debris education efforts, recommended further readings, and audio-visual materials available on the subject of marine plastic debris."
