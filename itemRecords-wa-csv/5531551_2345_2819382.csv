11,Abstract:,Genomic manipulations such as interspecific hybridization and induced polyploidy are becoming common practice in the management and culture of many species. Data from isozyme analyses can frequently play an important role in the utilization of these genetic processes in both applied and basic fishery science. The expression of structural genes encoding enzymes can provide an indirect measure of the number and parental source of chromosome sets present in manipulated progeny; it can also provide a direct measure of gene regulation in diploid and polyploid hybrids. This chapter describes the integral role allozyme analysis will play as the genomic manipulation of stocks becomes more widely utilized in fish culture and fisheries management.
