12,,"High hydrostatic pressure has been demonstrated to be a useful technique for treating food to reduce the number of pathogenic organisms and to extend shelf life. Most research in this area has focused on bacteria. However, a concern in the sashimi (raw fish) industry is that nematode worms such as ""Anisakis simplex"" occur naturally in cold- water marine fish. The authors of this research performed a pilot study to determine the effect of high hydrostatic pressure on the viability of ""A. simplex"" larvae, commonly found in king salmon and arrowtooth flounder. While the treatment was effective in killing ""A. simplex"" larvae in raw fish, they found it also had significant effects on the color and overall appearance of the fillet."
