11,Abstract:,"This paper explains the potential use of low-cost autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in fisheries research. Progress toward the actual use of AUVs as a tool for fisheries scientists and fishermen is described; and alternative methods for stock assessment made possible by AUVs, as well as applications for fish harvesting and aquaculture, are discussed. Because of their endurance and versatility, AUVs offer a cost-effective alternative to conventional methods of data collection for both scientists and fishermen."
