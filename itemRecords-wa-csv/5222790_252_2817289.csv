12,Abstract:,"This research has been directed towards the analysis and evaluation of a generalized data base management system, and the design of improved data base creation and updating methods. One of the problems confronting potential users of generalized systems is the selection of one of these systems from a wide variety of existing systems. In an attempt to evaluate a system, the feature analysis proposed by the Codasyl Systems Committee provide helpful guidelines. The Multi-Access Retrieval System-MARS VX has served as a focal point in this research effort.
