10,Abstract:,"This report discusses the increased user demands on many states' coastal waters which has spawned many conflicts over space allocation, resource allocation, and allowable resource degradation. It is clear that as conflicts escalate, states must more forcefully assert their role as public trustee by developing a comprehensive plan, establishing priorities and mediating among user groups."
