12,Abstract:,"Beta-​1,3-​glucanase may be involved in the defense of plants against pathogens through its ability to degrade the cell walls of fungal pathogens. In addition, some of the carbohydrates released from the fungal cell walls can elicit other plant defense responses. Results of a previous study indicated that the deduced amino acid sequence for a pea (""Pisum sativum"") glucanase clone, pPIG4-3, is highly homologous to those found in other plant species. This paper reports the complete sequencing of a 4132-bp pea beta-​1,3-​glucanase clone, pPIG5-4."
