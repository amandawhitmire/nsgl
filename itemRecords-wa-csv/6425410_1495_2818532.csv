9,Abstract:,"Once dominant along the North American west coast, Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) populations have declined significantly since the early 1900's. Restoration efforts have encountered many problems, one of which is the slow growth of O. lurida. This study aims to determine the effect of photoperiod and mechanical stress, environmental factors controllable in an aquaculture setting, on O. lurida stress and growth physiology. Natural photoperiod and absence of mechanical stress were expected to elicit a greater growth response. Oysters were separated into 12-hour light:12 dark or 24-hour light photoperiod treatments followed by mechanical stress or no mechanical stress. Tissue of oysters was analyzed using quantification of genes related to stress and growth. Results of stress genes indicated 12:12 photoperiod with mechanical stress induced greater stress. Growth genes implied 24-hour photoperiod with mechanical stress induced greater growth. Findings that 24-hour light was less stressful contradicted predictions that oysters would be better suited for conditions similar to natural lighting. The longer 24-hour light treatment could signal the growing season, which generally occurs in the summer months. Indications of growth in the 24-hour with stress treatment were also of interest. The results suggest that mechanical stress may play a role in stimulating growth in oysters. During the study, no growth was actually measured meaning quantification of genes only suggests possible physiological changes. Future work will aim to verify our results with real measured growth."
