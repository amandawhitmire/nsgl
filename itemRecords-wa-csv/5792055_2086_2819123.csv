9,Abstract:,"An interspecific analysis of life history characteristics for 28 stocks of fish showed that age at maturity, natural mortality (""M""), and reproductive effort (gonadosomatic index, GSI) were weakly but significantly correlated with body size. Viviparity was associated with reduced reproductive effort, reduced age at maturity, and low ""M"" relative to oviparous species of a corresponding size. Included in this study is an examination of the influence of viviparity on trade-offs in life history parameters, notably the trade-off between reproductive effort and adult survival. The authors suggest that if the correlation between GSI and ""M"" is to be used to provide indirect estimates of ""M"" for fisheries management, perhaps separate relationships should be used for oviparous and viviparous species."
