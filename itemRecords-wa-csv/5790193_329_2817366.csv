9,Abstract:,"Those who boat on Hood Canal (Washington State) for work or pleasure recognize how unique it is. Reaching some 62 miles from Foulweather Bluff to Belfair, Hood Canal's sheltered waters provide a home for birds, fish, shellfish, and other marine life, as well as a place for human activities. This brochure contains information to help maintain the beauty and health of Hood Canal and make boating trips safe and enjoyable. It includes a directory of pertinent phone numbers along with a two-color map of resources, facilities, sensitive areas, and boating facilities in Hood Canal."
