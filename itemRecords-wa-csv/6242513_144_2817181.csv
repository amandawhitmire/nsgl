10,,"At the direction of the State Legislature, the University of Washington's Washington Sea Grant established a geoduck aquaculture research program in 2007. Initial program activities included a review of existing scientific information and the commissioning of scientific research studies to assess possible effects of geoduck aquaculture on the Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca environments. Top priority has been assigned to examining the effects of commercial harvesting. Under Second Substitute House Bill 2220 (Chapter 216, Laws of 2007), Washington Sea Grant is tasked with completing the research studies and reporting the results to the Legislature by December 1, 2013. In 2007 and 2008, information on research activities was incorporated into the Washington State Department of Ecology's interim and final progress reports to the Legislature on the Shellfish Aquaculture Regulatory Committee (www.ecy.wa.gov​/ programs/sea/sh​ellfishcommitte​e/index.html). This report includes information on the research program covered by those earlier reports and provides an update on research progress in 2009."
