10,Abstract:,"This compendium contains over two-dozen lesson plans created by teachers participating in a series of interactive workshops designed to help link national geographic standards to concepts involving nonindigenous aquatic species, and to provide useful teaching tools involving concepts from geography, social studies, and biology. Some lessons deal with specific regions or species of concern to a region, while others are more global in scope. Most of the concepts, however, can be altered to suit any region or species. Some lesson plans can be used for any age group, while others have been designed with a particular age group in mind. One lesson plan is in Spanish.
