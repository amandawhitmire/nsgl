8,Abstract:,"Recreational boats and fishing vessels — not tankers and freighters — currently are the leading sources of known oil spills in Puget Sound. Between 2011 and 2015, recreational vessels reported spills of almost 6,000 gallons of diesel and gasoline in Washington and many go unreported. About two-thirds of these discharges are one gallon or less. Small spills, such as oily bilge discharge, accounted for an estimated 75 percent of the oil dumped into local waters over the last 10 years."
