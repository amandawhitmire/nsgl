13,Abstract:,"By catch (the capture of unmarketable or restricted species during commercial fishing) is a world economic, environmental, and political problem. This proceedings book features worldwide research and information on bycatch reduction methods and gear presented at the Solving Bycatch Workshop in September 1995 in Seattle. Forty-nine contributions address ecological impacts; fish behavior; management solutions; and gear types including trawls and codends, pot and scallop fisheries, longlines, gillnets, and purse seines."
