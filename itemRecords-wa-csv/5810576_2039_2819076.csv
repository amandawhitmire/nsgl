10,Abstract:,"In addition to applicable science, restoration of urban green areas requires two complementary efforts: a process to locate and rank potential restoration sites and an understanding of how restoration designs will be accepted in the urban Puget Sound region of Washington State. This discussion reports on two research studies using a geographic information system, one study demonstrates the feasibility and identifies the limits of combining physical data with social and political information. The second study is an ongoing, multidisciplinaâ€‹ry effort to evaluate the efficacy of regional urban stream restoration as to stream dynamics, biotic conditions and human responses. The human response part of this study uses photo-simulated images of proposed restoration designs to survey preferences, and evaluates human behavior toward urban streams."
