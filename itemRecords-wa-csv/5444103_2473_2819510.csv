9,Abstract:,"Theory has long predicted that the abundance of fish stocks is determined mainly by environmental conditions in early life history stages, when young fish are recruited to the adult population. Now strong evidence is emerging to support that theory. In this book the author reviews historical progress toward understanding factors believed to regulate animal populations. Using Atlantic herring as a point of departure, he divides marine animal species into geographic stocks and examines how their abundance and variability respond to localized physical processes. In his conclusion, he speculates on the implications his observations bear for ecological and evolutionary theory in general. This book is the first in a new series on recruitment fishery oceanography intended to disseminate current thinking on the effects of environmental variability on populations of marine organisms, especially those of commercial importance."
