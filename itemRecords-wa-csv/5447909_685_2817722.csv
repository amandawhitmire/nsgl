8,Abstract:,"A one-day seminar is not long enough to cover all the activities, groups, and research effort presently ongoing in the Puget Sound region. Seminar organizers decided to showcase two problems that have received much attention and that are considered to be most important to the conservation and development of the Sound and its resources: (1) toxicants-​-​their presence and distribution in the Sound's urban bay sediments, their point and non-point sources, and their resulting biological impacts; and (2) sewage contamination-​-​the bacterial contamination from sewage treatment plant effluent and from non-point land runoff that does not destroy shellfish resources, but does preclude commercial sales from contaminated beds. In the sessions that resulted speakers reviewed ways that agencies-​-​federal, state, and local--have responded to these problems and described management strategies to counteract them. They also described ways that management policies are creating useful interaction among agencies at different levels of government. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. Puget Sound, a fjord-like estuary. Alyn C. Duxbury pp. 1-11. 2. Sources of contamination in Puget Sound. Diane E. Strayer and Spyros P. Pavlou pp. 13-28. 3. Biological indication of pollution in Puget Sound. Edward R. Long pp. 29-45. 4. Bacterial contamination of shellfish in Puget Sound, Washington--a growing concern. John W. Armstrong and Daniel P. Cheney pp. 47-64. 5. Puget Sound sediments: a source and sink of contaminants. Robert C. Barrick pp. 65-82. 6. Toxic chemicals in fish: effects on their health and reproduction. Bruce B. McCain, Sin-Lam Chan, Usha Varanasi, Margaret M. Krahn, and Donald W. Brown pp. 83-109. 7. Contaminant levels in the edible portion of recreationally caught fish from Puget Sound, Washington. Marsha L. Landolt, David A. Kalman, and Ahmad E. Nevissi pp. 111-133. 8. The Puget Sound Estuary Program: managing for environmental results. Catherine Krueger and John Underwood pp. 135-148. 9. The plan for Puget Sound's future. Kirval Skinnarland, Kathy Fletcher, and John Dohrmann pp. 149-154. 10. Pollution management in Washington State. Andrea Beatty Riniker pp. 155-158. 11. Local goverments and clean water: fulfilling the agenda. Tim Douglas pp. 159-161."
