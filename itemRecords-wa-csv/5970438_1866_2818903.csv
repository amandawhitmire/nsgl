10,Abstract:,"The Puget Sound Water Quality Action Team has a legislative mandate to coordinate local, state, and federal action to protect and restore the health of Puget Sound. This report summarizes current shipping trends and ballast water practices in the Puget Sound/Georgia Basin area as well as ballast water exchange programs on the Pacific coast. In addition, it outlines a series of institutional, operational, oceanographic, and biological considerations for locating alternative zones for ballast water exchange for vessels entering the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Existing information and management gaps are identified and possible directions are proposed."
