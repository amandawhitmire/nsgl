8,Abstract:,"Fostering water-dependent industry through allocation of urban shoreline sites is an important coastal management goal. But water-​dependency is an elusive term to define operationally. A study of establishments occupying shoreline parcels in Puget Sound's urban harbors over two decades (1962-82) reveals the changing degree to which specific industries have been concentrated on shoreline sites, hence their changing degree of water-​dependency. The uneven discrimination among marine-related industries provided by the Standard Industrial Classification Code (SIC) limits precise measurement of water-​dependency. The public policy issue of preferential treatment for water-dependent industries in the coastal zone is more likely to be raised in the case of an expanding (rather than static or declining) industry; but whether or not the rate of expansion on the shoreline is higher than in the inland region must also be considered when assessing water-​dependence."
