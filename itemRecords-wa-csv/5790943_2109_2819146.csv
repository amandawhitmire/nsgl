13,Abstract:,"Thermophilic and hyperthermophil​ic microorganisms were cultured from 18 deg. C diffuse hydrothermal fluids at the CoAxial segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge deep-sea hydrothermal vent site 3 months after an eruption resulting from an intrusion of magma into shallow crust. The abundances of these organisms decreased over a 3-year period as the shallow magma cooled. The authors suggest that these organisms grew in response to nutrient input from hydrothermal fluid circulation and temperature (3-30 deg. C) fluids at three other chronic, highly active deep-sea vent sites."
