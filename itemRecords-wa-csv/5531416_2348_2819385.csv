13,Abstract:,"In designing a gear research experiment, two procedures invariably recommended by statisticians are (1) the randomization of treatment types to eliminate systematic effects, including possible subjective inputs by the researchers, and (2) the use of complete statistical blocks (to reduce the sample sizes needed to obtain statistically defensible results). However, the frequent changes of nets or cod ends necessitated by a randomized block design increases the workload and reduces trip revenues. Thus, the advantages of blocking need to be demonstrated in simple quantitative terms, particularly when research is to be performed under commercial operating conditions using donated vessel time. A method for estimating the sample sizes needed to reject an experimental hypothesis with a given design at a pre-set level of statistical significance and power is presented for an alternate tow gear experiment. For the specific application examined, there is a 4-10-fold reduction in sample size when randomized complete blocks are used within a vessel trip, compared with an unblocked experimental design using only one treatment type per vessel trip."
