12,Abstract:,"The authors of this review characterize the effects of interdecadal climate forcing on the oceanic ecosystems of the NE Pacific Ocean. They discuss a number of recent studies relating climate to marine ecosystem dynamics with focus on primary and secondary producers, forage species, and several levels of predators. Together these studies reveal how decadal-scale climate forcing may affect the large oceanic ecosystems of the NE Pacific."
