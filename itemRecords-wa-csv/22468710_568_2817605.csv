17,Abstract:,"The purpose of the Salish Sea Transboundary Action Plan for Invasive European Green Crab (Plan) is to establish and implement a coordinated and collaborative response to incursions of European green crab that pose a risk of harming or threatening the environmental, economic, or human resources within the shared waters of the Salish Sea. European green crab (EGC) is a globally-​damaging invasive species that has produced a variety of ecological and economic impacts on temperate coastal shorelines worldwide. Prolific and gregarious, EGC are known to disturb native habitat, displace resident species, and alter natural food webs, when abundant. Additionally, EGC predation has caused significant harm to shellfish industries in some regions. Using lessons learned from successful early detection and rapid responses, this Salish Sea Transboundary Action Plan for Invasive European Green Crab lays out clear actions to be taken to prevent and/or minimize harm to the environmental, economic, and human resources of the Salish Sea as a whole from an invasion of European green crab. This action plan focuses on six objectives calling for: • Collaborative management; • Prevention of human-mediated introduction and spread; • Early detection; • Rapid response to newly detected incursions; • Control of infested sites; and • Strategic research to improve adaptive management. Was​hington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), and Transport Canada are the key regulatory managers of potential human-mediated introduction and spread of EGC through their respective Aquatic Invasive Species programs. Washington Sea Grant’s (WSG) Crab Team program, in coordination with WDFW, plays a major role in early detection and rapid response by training and supporting hundreds of volunteers and agency and tribal staff to monitor sites for early detection. The actions laid out in this plan follow WDFW’s and DFO’s legal authority and mandate to lead the response to EGC in the Salish Sea. The estimated costs of implementing this plan for the Washington State 2019-21 fiscal year biennium (July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2021) and projections for future years will be addressed in a separate budget document. There is still opportunity to avoid major impacts from EGC in the Salish Sea by taking decisive and aggressive actions to contain populations and to prevent further introduction and spread of EGC in other parts of the Salish Sea."
