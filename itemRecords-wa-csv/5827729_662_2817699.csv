9,Abstract:,Research was initiated in 1999 to test seabird deterrents on active fishing vessels in two Alaska longline fleets: the IFQ sablefish fishery and the Pacific cod fishery. The goal of the research program is to develop methods to reduce the incidental capture of seabirds in Alaska longline fisheries without decreasing the target catch or increasing the bycatch of other species. This publication features a schematic and detailed description of an Alaska streamer line design being used for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service-funded program administered by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission that will make streamer lines available to the Alaska longline fleet.
