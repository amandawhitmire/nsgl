16,Abstract:,"Migratory species take advantage of multiplehabitat​s during their life cycle to optimize growth, survival,and reproduction. However, migration also makesthem vulnerable to habitat degradation and exploitationin each habitat, and loss of connection between habitats.Partia​lly migratory species (i.e., migration is facultativerath​er than obligate) can persist after loss of connectivityand may then resume migration after the habitats arereconnected.​We analyzed stable isotopes of carbon andnitrogen to investigate the possible use of marine habitatsfor foraging by bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, inyears immediately after removal of impassable hydroelectricda​ms on the Elwha River, Washington State,USA. Juveniles in the Elwha River estuary were similarin δ15N and δ13C values to those in the estuary of thefree-flowing Dungeness River nearby, and the values offish from the estuaries were higher than those of juvenilescollec​ted in the river, consistent with use of marinefood sources. Adult bull trout collected in each of therivers had values indicating extensive reliance on marineprey - similar to those of adult Pacific salmon thathad spent several years at sea. Taken together, these datademonstrate that the Elwha River bull trout, almostentirely landlocked for a century, are rapidly resuminganadrom​y and that the marine prey contribute substantiallyto their trophic ecology and likely their growth.More broadly, the results reveal the importance of connectivityfor migratory fishes, their ability to resumeanadromy once the connection between habitats is restored,and the population resilience that partial migrationprovid​es for them."
