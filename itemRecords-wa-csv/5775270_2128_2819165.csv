13,Abstract:,"The fungicidal class I endochitinases are associated with the biochemical defense of plants against potential pathogens. The authors of this study isolated and sequenced a genomic clone, DAH53, corresponding to a class I basic endochitinase gene in pea, ""Chil"". The pea genome contains one gene corresponding to the chitinase DAH53 probe. Chitinase RNA accumulation was observed in pea pods within 2 to 4 h after inoculation with the incompatable fungal strain ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli"", the compatible strain ""F. solani"": f. sp. ""pisi"", or the elicitor chitosan. The RNA accumulation was high in the lower stem and root of both fungus challenged and wounded pea seedlings. The sustained high levels of chitinase mRNA expression may contribute to later stages of pea's non-host resistance."
