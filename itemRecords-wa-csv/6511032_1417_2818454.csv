14,Abstract:,"This report provides an overview of 2012 water quality and conditions and associated biota in Puget Sound from comprehensive monitoring and observing programs. The report focuses on the marine waters of greater Puget Sound. Additional selected conditions are also included due to their influence on Puget Sound waters, such as selected climate indices and conditions along the outer Washington coast. In addition to observations on marine phytoplankton, bacteria, and pathogens contained within the marine waters, this year we have expanded to include observations on marine birds that use this marine water habitat."
