14,Abstract:,"The Coastal Zone Management Effectiveness Study was undertaken between 1995 and 1997 to determine how well state coastal management programs in the United States were implementing five of the core objectives of the U.S. Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). This overview article provides the governmental and policy structure for the U.S. CZM effort, noting the challenges that structure creates for systematic evaluation. Second, the framework for the CZME is established starting with a concise reference to selected past evaluation studies to distinguish them from the program effectiveness approach chosen here. The framework is described in some detail because it provides the general model used by each of the five individual studies, and the method may be used, modified, or amplified by other evaluators in the future. Third, the five studies of the core objectives are summarized briefly, noting how the methods for each may have differed from the general model, and presenting key conclusions specific to that topic. Lastly, national conclusions and recommendations about coastal program effectiveness and the need for future monitoring of results are reported."
