9,Abstract:,"No single gene product, attributable to a single Mendelian trait for disease resistance in plants as designated in the gene-for-gene hypothesis, has been biochemically characterized or had its structural gene cloned. However, the presence of such Mendelian traits in a genotype can be shown to be associated with pleiotropic effects involving the increased activation of multiple host genes. Discussion here relates aspects of nuclear structure to molecular explanations of gene-for-gene interactions."
