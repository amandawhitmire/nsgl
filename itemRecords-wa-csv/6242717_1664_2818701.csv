9,Abstract:,"Among human alterations to genetic diversity of fish populations are those imposed through hatcheries and by fishing. Translocations, reintroductions and supportive breeding can affect population structure, and fishing may be an important evolutionary force by changing the mean length and age of mature individuals, although fishing gear, locations and genetic correlations can affect the response. Paired comparisons of microsatellite DNA divergence of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) from different rivers around Puget Sound, Washington in 1938 indicated that the genetic differentiation was correlated with the geographic distance, consistent with a stepping stone model of isolation. Hatcheries have released millions of individuals of within river or within Puget Sound ancestry during the intervening years. The genetic differentiation between pairs of recently sampled rivers was no longer correlated with the geographic distance but with the number of individuals transferred between the two rivers. The genetic diversity among populations within rivers also declined with increased numbers of local origin individuals released. These results indicate that hatchery practices since 1938 have altered the pattern of gene flow among rivers, and homogenized populations within rivers. To evaluate fishery-induced changes to the mean length and age of mature individuals, we coupled a quantitative genetic model for length at ages zero through five, considering a range of genetic correlations, with population dynamics models parameterized from real Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations to simulate 100 years of harvest using 1) gillnets, which impose disruptive selection, or 2) long-lines, which impose minimum size selection, and targeting a) immature individuals in the high-seas, or b) mature individuals in the terminal area. The most abundant age class present during harvest usually dictated the overall response when traits were positively or negative correlated. In the high-seas this was the youngest age harvested or an older age in the terminal area. Selection differentials for the older ages were initially small for long-lines because we assumed only 50% of individuals within the selection window were harvested. Therefore, a long-line terminal fishery caused the least change. The results presented here reveal that human impacts on the genetic diversity may make salmon less resilient to environmental change, but also suggest management strategies to reduce those impacts."
