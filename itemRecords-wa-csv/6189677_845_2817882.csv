7,Abstract:,"Small oil spills continue to plague our marine environment. These spills often go unnoticed and introduce tens of thousands of gallons of persistent, toxic oil into our waters every year-often a few drops at a time. Washington Sea Grant Program is working to curb these spills and, with continued Legislative support, will share its message of ""protection through prevention"" with thousands of commercial and recreational boaters throughout Washington state."
