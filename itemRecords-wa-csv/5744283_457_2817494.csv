14,Abstract:,"This paper provides a general overview of sustainability program efforts across the National Sea Grant College Program Network. It also presents selected examples from the States of Louisiana, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Washington on sustainability projects. These projects demonstrate how universities, government and the private sector have developed partnerships to manage coastal resources on the sustainable basis. The examples also demonstrate how these partnerships can provide economic, environmental and social benefits to local communities and private landowners."
