21,Abstract:,"Fisheries genetics researchers will find invaluable the 38 peer-reviewed contributions in this book, presented at the 20th Lowell Wakefield Fisheries Symposium 'Genetics of Subpolar Fish and Invertebrates,' held in May 2002 in Juneau, Alaska. These contributions are important to modern fisheries science and genetics, and illustrate the evolution of the field over the past decade. Papers are organized into the following sections: Genetics of populations (subsections: freshwater and anadromous; marine; methods and applications); Genetic variability (subsections: fitness and adaptation; phenotype and maintenance of variation); Aquaculture genetics (subsections: interactions of cultured and wild fish; applications); and Phylogenetics. ​ The following papers are included in this proceedings: 1. Migration of Pacific Rim chum salmon on the high seas: insights from genetic data. L. W. Seeb, et al. pp. 21-36. 2.
