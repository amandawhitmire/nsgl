14,Abstract:,"A 10-year selection and breeding program with coho salmon was conducted to improve traits of primary importance to the saltwater net-pen industry. After four generations, this program has produced two pedigreed lines (maturing in odd- and even-years) which have shown a greater than 60% improvement in weight. Heritabilities for weight remained high, even in later generations. This report presents the genetic and phenotypic response of the broodstock to four generations of selection under the designed program. The results indicate that a long-term selection program on coho salmon could produce large improvements in performance without dramatically reducing genetic variation."
