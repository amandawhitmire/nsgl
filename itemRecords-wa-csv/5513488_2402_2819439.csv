11,Abstract:,"Unlike point source pollution at which much existing regulation is aimed, nonpoint source pollution does not have its origins in readily identifiable and discrete sources. Nonpoint source pollution is generally perceived as a problem whose solutions do not lie in the relatively expensive and technologically complex processes which have generally been used to address point source pollution problems. This article uses elements of implementation theory to examine the question of how best to design nonpoint source pollution control programs and highlights the need to address two related but different types of questions: (1) what measures are capable of reducing pollutant loading when broadly applied in a particular geographic area of concern, and (2) what implementation approaches are capable of achieving sufficient levels of acceptance and utilization in the target population to assure attainment of program goals? Efforts to develop an `early action' nonpoint control program in the Burley Lagoon-Minter Bay watershed of south Puget Sound illustrate the difficulties decision makers can have in balancing the ability of proposed management options to achieve water quality and biological objectives against their effects on the willingness and ability of the intended target groups to adopt the necessary control measures."
