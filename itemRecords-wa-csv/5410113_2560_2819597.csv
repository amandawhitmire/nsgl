9,Abstract:,"The cell walls of ""Fusarium solani"" and many other fungi contain chitosan. Chitosan applied externally to ""F. solani"" macroconidia inhibits germination and growth, whereas chitosan applied to pea endocarp tissue activates the disease resistance responses as does inoculation with the incompatible pathogen. The mode by which chitosan can both induce plant genes and suppress fungal growth is not completely understood. The present study was conducted to determine the influence of chitosan and fungal plant pathogens on cell membranes as measured by ion leakage and cell viability using the vital stains, fluorescein diacetate (FDA), and phenosafranin."
