11,Abstract:,"Nucleotide polymorphism at the pantophysin Pan I) locus in walleye pollock, ""Theragra chalcogramma,"" was examined using DNA sequence data. Two distinct allelic lineages were detected in pollock, resulting from three amino acid replacement mutations in the first intravesicular domain of the protein. The common ""Pan"" I allelic group, comprising 94% of the samples, was less polymorphic (71 = 0.005) than the uncommon group (71 = 0.008), and nucleotide diversity in both was higher than for two allelic lineages in the related Atlantic cod, ""Gadus morhua."" Phylogenetic analyses of ""Pan"" I sequences from these two species did not clearly resolve orthology among allelic groups, in part because of recombination that has occurred between the two pollock lineages. Conventional tests of neutrality comparing polymorphisms within and between homologous regions of the ""Pan"" I locus in walleye pollock and Atlantic cod did not detect the effects of selection. This result is likely attributed to low levels of synonymous divergence among allelic lineages and a lack of mutation- drift equilibrium inferred from nucleotide mismatch frequency distributions. However, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site (dN/dS) exceeded unity in two intravesicular domains of the protein and the influence of positive selection at multiple codon sites was strongly inferred through the use of maximum- likelihood analyses. In addition, the frequency spectrum of linked neutral variation showed indirect effects of adaptive hitchhiking in pollock resulting from a selective sweep of the common allelic lineage. Recombination between the two allelic classes may have prevented complete loss of the older, more polymorphic lineage. The results suggest that recurrent sweeps driven by positive selection is the principle mode of evolution at the ""Pan"" I locus in gadid fishes."
