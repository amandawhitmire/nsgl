11,Abstract:,"This fact sheet discusses how species that are introduced into habitats where they are not native--called 'exotics,' 'non-indigenous species,' or 'aliens'--can result in habitat alteration and degradation. They can outcompete native species for food, space and other resources, sometimes even causing extinction of native species. It also explains how exotics can be introduced into a specific habitat and how one can assist in preventing the introduction of alien species."
