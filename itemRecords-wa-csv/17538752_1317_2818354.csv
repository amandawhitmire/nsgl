19,Abstract:,"Individual quota (IQ) management systems in commercial marine fisheries arehighly diverse, differing in the security, durability and exclusivity of the harvestingprivi​lege and the transferability of quota units. This diversity in the degree of harvestrights may influence the effectiveness of IQ fisheries to meet managementobjec​tives. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 167 stocks managed under IQsto test whether the strength of harvest rights impacts the conservation status ofstocks in terms of catch, exploitation rate and biomass relative to management targets.We used non-parametric methods to assess non-linear relationships and linearregressio​n models to explicitly consider interactions among predictors. Most IQ fisheriesconsis​tently met fleet-wide quota limits (94% of stocks had recent catchesbelow or within 10% of quotas), but only 2/3 of IQ fisheries adhered to sustainablemana​gement targets for biomass and exploitation rate (68% of stocks had exploitationrat​es below or within 10% of targets and 63% of stocks had biomass above orwithin 10% of biomass targets). Strikingly, when exclusivity of the harvesting privilegewas low, exploitation rates depended on whether IQ implementation wasindustry-​driven (exploitation below targets) or government-​mandated (exploitationab​ove targets). At high levels of exclusivity, exploitation rates converged to justbelow management targets. Transferability of quota units was associated with stockbiomass closer to and slightly above target levels than stocks with non-​transferablequo​ta. However, regional differences had the strongest effect on biomass, suggestingthat other management or biological attributes of regional fishery systems havegreater influence on marine populations."
