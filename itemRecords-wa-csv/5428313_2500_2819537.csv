9,Abstract:,"To produce a summer oyster, the authors' used induction of triploidy through chromosomal manipulation to produce sterile oysters that devote less effort toward reproduction. Cytochalasin B (CB) was selected for this study because in preliminary comparisons with pressure, CB yielded significantly higher survival rates and percentages of triploidy. The optimal induction window at three temperatures (those treatments which produce high proportions of the triploidy and acceptable larval survival), were determined. Initial investigations were also conducted on two variables which will be important to large-scale induction, CB dosage and egg density."
