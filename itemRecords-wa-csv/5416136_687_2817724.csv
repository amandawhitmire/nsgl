9,Abstract:,"The gamotogenic cycle of the Japanese Suminoe oyster, ""Crassostrea rivularis"", was compared with that of two groups of Pacific oysters (""Crassostrea gigas"") on an intertidal oyster bed in Oakland Bay, Washington. The Pacific oysters exhibited an earlier and more extensive development of gonads and resulting carbohydrate depletion was much greater. Both groups of Pacific oysters spawned completely in mid-August. ""C. rivularis"" did not spawn but rather initiated phagocytosis of gametes by leucocytes. The implications of these results on the development of a marketable `summer' oyster are discussed."
