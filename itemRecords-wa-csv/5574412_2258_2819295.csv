11,Abstract:,"Recruitment of Dungeness crab, ""Cancer magister"", is reviewed considering all three major life stages: embryo, larvae and juveniles. Recruitment is defined as abundance change between consecutive life history stages, culminating ultimately in an annual increase in abundance of the fished population since larger crabs only molt once annually. Events progressively occurring throughout the life history cycle are discussed as these will bear on the abundance of crabs at each successive life history stage leading to recruitment to the fishery. Recruitment was examined in four major geographic regions selected on the basis of broad-scale oceanographic boundaries, unique oceanographic singularities, and available data on local dungeness crab population dynamics."
