14,,"Nori farming involves not only the winter cultivation of ""Porphyra"" blades, but also summer culturing of conchocelis-​bearing mollusk shells. This publication provides the grower with a quide for setting up and operating a conchocelis culturing facility. ""Porphyra"" (nori) grows from spores which are released by a plant that bears no physical resemblance to the nori blade. This plant, called conchocelis, is the summer phase of the ""Porphyra"" life cycle; in nature, it borrows and grows beneath the surface of mollusk shells. Released spores will float into the high intertidal and attach to rocks or any other suitable substrate, developing into ""Porphyra"" blades and completing the life cycle. The culture technique and materials described in this publication are similar to those used by growers in Japan and can be easily applied to a commercial scale greenhouse and tank facility."
