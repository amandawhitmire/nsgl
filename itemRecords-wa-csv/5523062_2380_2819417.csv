11,Abstract:,"It is well recognized that the Chromophyta include a broad spectrum of organisms that vary significantly in morphology, biochemistry and development. Despite extensive research, many enigmatic questions remain concerning the phylogeny and evolution of this diverse taxonomic assemblage. One may hypothesize that certain molecules within both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells could act as evolutionary footprints which would give clues to the ancestry and relatedness, not only of specific organisms, but their composite organelles as well. This review focuses on how molecular information may be utilized to probe questions concerning algal chloroplast evolution and phylogeny."
