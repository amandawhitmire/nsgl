8,Abstract:,"What impact does the EEZ Proclamation have on domestic marine resource law? Does it impose any new responsibilitie​s on the federal government? Resources claimed under the Proclamation are public resources which the government holds in trust for the people of the United States. This article analyzes the public trust doctrine as applicable to resource management decisions in the EEZ, commencing with discussion of the evolution of expanded coastal nation jurisdiction over EEZ resources formerly regarded as common property resources. Perimeters of the upland and tidelands public trust doctrines in U.S. law are reviewed, followed by a description of the use of the tidelands trust as an appropriate vehicle for assuring that the federal government does not abrogate its trust responsibilitie​s in the EEZ."
