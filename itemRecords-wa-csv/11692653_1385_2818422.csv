11,Abstract:,"A small test market at a high-end grocery store near Washington, D.C., USA, showed that farm-grown freshwater prawns would sell to high-income consumers who had not previously tried the product. About 83% of first-time buyers said the shrimp, presented less than 24 hours after harvest, tasted good or very good. About 62% of first-time buyers said they would buy again next year. Although both head-on and deheaded shrimp were offered, most customers were reluctant to try the head-on samples."
