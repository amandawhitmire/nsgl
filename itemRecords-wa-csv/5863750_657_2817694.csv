11,Abstract:,"This investigation assembled data on coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") form 14 streams in western Washington, including annual smolt counts and annual escapement, either as absolute counts or as an index. Also compiled were data on large woody debris, road densities in the watersheds, gradient of the streams, valley slope adjacent to the stream, drainage area in the watershed, and pool, pond, and lake areas. The authors explored the relationships between habitat variables and two measures of coho production, the maximum production of smolts in the stream (capacity) and the maximum smolts/spawner (productivity.) Using the 11 streams with pool and pond counts, they found that pool and pond densities served as good predictors of smolt density. They also found that lower valley slopes, lower road densities, and lower stream gradients were correlated with higher smolt density."
