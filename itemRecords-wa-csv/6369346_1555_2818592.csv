8,Abstract:,"The goal of this research was to investigate the ecological effects of geoduck harvest practices on the benthic infauna by quantifying changes in benthic community abundance, structure, and diversity. Objectives were to 1) create a baseline for benthic organism abundance, 2) quantify the harvest impact (if any) on benthic organism abundance, diversity, and community structure, and 3) determine the temporal extent of the harvest impact (if any)."
