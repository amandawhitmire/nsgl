18,Notes:,"A report prepared for the Washington Coastal Resilience Project (WCRP). This document was developed in partnership with the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group, Washington Sea Grant, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Estuary and Salmon Restoration Program (ESRP)."
19,Abstract:,"The Washington Coastal Resilience Project (WCRP) is a three-year effort to rapidly increase the state’s capacity to prepare for coastal hazards, such as flooding and erosion, that are related to sea level rise. The project will improve risk projections, provide better guidance for land use planners and strengthen capital investment programs for coastal restoration and infrastructure. Sea level is rising along much of Washington’s coast and is projected to rise at an accelerating rate as the climate continues to warm. Local variation in vertical land movement causes different rates of relative sea level change along the coast and in Puget Sound. For example, the Seattle tide gauge shows relative sea level rise (SLR) of 8.6 inches since 1900 due to a combination of land subsidence and SLR. In contrast, relative sea level has dropped in Neah Bay by 5.2 inches since 1934 due to a localized area of rapid uplift of the land. Rising seas and associated changes in coastal hazards such as flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion will impact nearshore restoration projects. Given these observed and projected future changes in sea level and coastal hazards, we developed this document to assist restoration professionals with considering SLR impacts in the planning and design of nearshore restoration projects in Puget Sound."
