10,Abstract:,"In the early 1970s, Alaska production of salmon was declining and the state was unable to take full advantage of lucrative salmon prices. Alaska, which was once the dominant supplier of salmon worldwide, was losing its hold on salmon markets. In response, the state of Alaska developed an extensive salmon hatchery program designed to create a stream of revenue from this valuable renewable resource. However, since 1988 Alaska salmon prices have steadily declined. A revenue analysis was performed to examine the effects of various salmon enhancement production levels on future revenue generated to salmon fishers working in Alaska waters. The results were then used in a cost/benefit analysis of the state's enhancement program for sockeye, chinook, coho, chum, and pink salmon. This report focuses on the two most important Alaska salmon species, sockeye and pink. Results of the revenue analysis indicate that for sockeye salmon, future revenues would increase if output from salmon enhancement were expanded. For pink salmon, revenues would decrease if salmon enhancement were expanded and increase if salmon enhancement were scaled back. However, a complete elimination of the pink hatchery program would decrease revenues. For both species, there are important regional differences."
