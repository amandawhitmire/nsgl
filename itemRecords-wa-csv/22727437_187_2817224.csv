11,Abstract:,"November, 2020, This year was already poised to be exceptionally busy for WSG Crab Team and the management of the European green crab invasion in Washington – even before we were faced with a global pandemic. Through last winter, facing new detection sites in Whatcom County, and increasing reports of green crab on the Pacific coast of Washington, Crab Team was collaborating with Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife to substantially expand management capacity. Now, as we take our seasonal pause in trapping, and reflect on what we did manage to accomplish in spite of all the obstacles 2020 has thrown at all of us, we are proud to share a few of the highlights."
