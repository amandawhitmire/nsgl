12,Abstract:,"The National Working Waterfronts & Waterways Symposium is the crown jewel of the National Working Waterfront Network. People from across the United States attend the symposium to connect with one another and showcase (and initiate) innovative solutions to their waterfront issues. The ultimate goal of the symposium, and the Network, is to increase the capacity of saltwater- and freshwater-​based coastal communities and for stakeholders to make informed decisions, balance diverse uses, ensure access, and plan for the future of their working waterfronts. Working waterfronts include waterfront lands, waterfront infrastructure, and waterways that are used for water-dependent activities, such as ports, marinas, small recreational boat harbors, fishing docks and hundreds of other places across the country where people use and access the water. By design, the triennial symposium moves around the country to highlight the diversity of our nation’s working waterfronts, to foster a cross-​fertilization of ideas, knowledge and solutions, and to generate strategic partnerships. The 1st symposium was held in Virginia, the 2nd in Maine, and the 3rd in Washington State. The 4th symposium will shine a light on Gulf Coast communities and their waterfronts. The Gulf region comprises five (1/6th) of the thirty U.S. coastal (and Great Lakes) states, yet accounts for about 24% of ocean-related jobs, 29% of ocean-related wages, and 35% of the nation’s ocean-related Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Florida Sea Grant, the National Sea Grant Law Center, and the Mississippi-​Alabama Sea Grant Consortium sponsored the 4th National Symposium. The symposium also incorporated the third edition of Florida’s reoccurring state conference: Stem to Stern: Boating and Waterway Management in Florida. The 4th National Working Waterfronts & Waterways Symposium was held on November 16-19, 2015 in Tampa, Florida."
