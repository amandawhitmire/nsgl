12,Abstract:,"Many people want information about marinas in Washington State. Boaters are looking for places to moor their boats; government agencies need to know where moorage is located in relation to fisheries they manage, or waterways they dredge and maintain; marina equipment and service firms need access to customers; trade associations want to know how various segments of the moorage industry will be affected by proposed laws or regulations; and planning and engineering consultants want a readily accessible, common base of detailed information about marinas, statewide. This directory provides that information; 379 facilities are listed alphabetically by county and marina name."
