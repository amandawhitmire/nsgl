11,Abstract:,"Oceanographers used recent and historical information to construct an updated synthesis of large-scale current patterns and water properties of the Pacific Northwest coastal zone and their variability, extending the synthesis where appropriate to suggest interactions between the physical environment and the ecosystem. In particular, an along-coast gradient in coastal productivity, one that opposes the along-coast gradient in wind forcing, is examined. The effects of important mesoscale features such as shelf width, submarine banks, canyons, and river plumes are considered, and new data from the Pacific Northwest Coastal Ecosystems Regional Study are presented to further describe important processes and variability within the region's coastal estuaries and links between the estuaries and the coastal ocean."
