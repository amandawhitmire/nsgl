11,Abstract:,"The following 73 pages of clippings are not organized as an argument for or against limited entry in the commercial fisheries. The clippings were cut from the Kodiak Mirror, the Fishermen's News, National Fisherman, Seattle Post Intelliencer, and news releases from the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission of the State of Alaska. The publications from which these items were taken represent in part the fisheries media which flows through this office from day to day. Chronologically​, this material extends from Hay, 1974 into July, 1975, a period of rather intensive comment on limited entry for the salmon fisheries as proposed in Washington State and is being implemented for the same species in the State of Alaska."
