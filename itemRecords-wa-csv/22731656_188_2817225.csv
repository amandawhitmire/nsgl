15,Abstract:,"Washington Sea Grant (WSG) maintains a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) by pursuing diverse perspectives and enhancing cultural understanding. WSG’s mission is to help people and marine life thrive by providing research, technical expertise and educational activities that support the responsible use and conservation of ocean and coastal ecosystems. We seek to forge tools, foster insights, build capacity and maintain relationships for sustainable management, enjoyment, and use of Washington’s marine resources. WSG endorses and is committed to pursuing activities that advance diversity, equity and inclusion across our core functions of research, outreach, education and communications.​ The Roadmap contains thirteen goals addressing the work and people who make up WSG. The strategies are designed to achieve outcomes consistent with each goal. Eight outcomes have been identified as short-term priorities. These include, in part: ◆ WSG’s mission and strategic plan reflect DEI as a core value and philosophy ◆ WSG has regularly-​collected metrics for evaluating progress toward DEI goals ◆ WSG staff, fellows, students, advisory committee members and program participants (current and future) feel that WSG is a space where they belong. WSG is thrilled to be on a path toward building and sustaining a culture where WSG staff, partners and Washington’s coastal communities are able to bring their full selves to every WSG endeavor. We aim for everyone to feel that they belong within our organization and programs."
