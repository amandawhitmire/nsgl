10,Abstract:,"This book tells two stories: the story of an important and highly visible public resource, and the tale of an obscure but influential governmental institution. The resource is the urban harbor and waterfront, a recently rediscovered asset of the millions of people in cities and towns that front on rivers, lakes, bays, estuaries, and oceans in the United States. The governmental institution is the public port agency, a semiautonomous landlord and public relations agent that quietly builds docks or moves cargo or moors boats, acting as overseer of the waterfront. Ultimately this book asks how the institution affects the resource, and how the public port contributes to the stewardship of the urban harbor. Essays explore the changes that have occurred in the modern harbor in the 1970s and 1980s and the many roles of the public port in stimulating or responding to these changes. The goal is to understand the modern harbor and public port and the contemporary pressures on them. The following chapters are included in this book: 1.
