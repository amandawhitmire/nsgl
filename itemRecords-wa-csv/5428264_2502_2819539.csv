8,Abstract:,"Genetic manipulations in shellfish fall into two categories: cytogenetic and molecular techniques. Induced triploidy is becoming a well established procedure in bivalve culture; chemical, pressure, and thermal shocks have been effective. Because gonad production in triploid shellfish is retarded, growth is enhanced and meat quality is preserved during reproduction. Gynogenetic techniques are not yet well developed. Cloning techniques are beginning to reach aquacultural species; three approaches are discussed. Cryopreservatio​n techniques of eggs or embryos of commercially important bivalves have not been studied extensively but are feasible."
