12,Abstract:,"The ways in which marine carnivores affect biodiversity are conspicuous. Studies documenting some of these effects have shaped modern ecology. For example, concepts such as ""keystone species,"" in which carnivores at relatively low abundance structure natural communities by mediating competition (Paine 1966), and ""trophic cascades,"" in which predators regulate herbivores allowing edible plants to be limited only by resources (Paine 1980; Carpenter and Kitchell 1993), were both first observed and described in the marine realm. These examples were top-down (consumer-â€‹dominated) effects driven by marine carnivores (Menge and Sutherland 1987; Scheffer et al. 2001; Steneck, this volume). These examples came from the marine real in part because shallow marine benthic ecosystems are accessible and scaled conveniently in space and time for ecological studies and also because documented predator impacts in these systems appear to be particularly strong (Schmitz et al. 2000; Shurin et al. 2002; Steneck, this volume). Oceans cover two-thirds of Earth, but most are nutrient-poor and populated with hyperdispersed and often highly migratory organisms that are difficult to study. Our review focuses on a subset of the marine realm: the coastal zones, shallow continental shelves where marine life concentrates at or near the seafloor. In this chapter we illustrate how widespread and globally important carnivores, particularly large carnivores, have been, and are, to the structure of marine ecosystems. We do not suggest that carnivores heavily influence all shallow benthic marine ecosystems, but they do influence many (or they have in the past) and thus should be considered for managing the biodiversity of those ecosystems. Large carnivores and top-down controls are also important in some pelagic and deep-sea realms, but they are studied less and are outside the scope of this review."
