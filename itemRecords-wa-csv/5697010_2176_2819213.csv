11,Abstract:,"This paper summarizes recent studies concerned with the mechanistic basis for large variations in Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") populations along the U.S. west coast. Because aspects of the ""C. magister"" life history are consistent with those of other commercially or ecologically important species, its recruitment mechanism may be representative of a larger group of coastal upwelling species and may thus provide insight beyond the present context. Analyses suggest that larvae in near-surface waters are advected considerable (and variable) distances alongshore, while being maintained close to shore and close to suitable juvenile habitat. This model contrasts with the prevailing paradigm for the species, which suggests that zoeae undergo progressive seaward transport after hatching followed by cross-shelf return of megalopae before settlement. Given the expected changes in temperature, salinity, and pH for the northeastern Pacific and the functional relationship between larval transport and year-class strength, indirect effects of greenhouse warming on coastal circulation will be most significant to ""C. magister"" populations."
