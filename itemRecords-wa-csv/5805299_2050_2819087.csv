11,Abstract:,"Using mark and recapture rates of coded-​wire-​tagged salmonids, the authors of this study compare salmon survivals over a large geographical range, both to detect declines in survival in the Pacific Northwest and to identify geographical and temporal patterns of survival. Using coho (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") and fall chinook (""O. tshawytscha"") as examples, they explore the relation between survival and age of the hatchery, as well as the hypothesis that declines in survival are caused by an increase in production from hatcheries located in less favorable locations. Overall results indicate that changes in ocean conditions could be at least partially responsible for the survival declines of coho and chinook in the Pacific Northwest."
