8,Abstract:,"The notion that a fishing vessel's costs are a function of its `effort' is a useful paradigm in fishery analysis. This paper elaborates on this micro-theoretic approach, and proposes a way to view the cost of effort relation as the interaction of capital intensity decisions and the length of the fishing season. The model indicates that capital intensity decisions are affected by season closures, and that season closures can be used to redistribute wealth among different classes of fishermen."
