10,Abstract:,"Effective population size (Ne) is inversely related to the rate of loss of genetic diversity and the rate of loss of genetic diversity and the rate of increase in inbreeding in a population that is finite but otherwise randomly mating. How the ratio of Ne to the number of sexually mature adults (N) varies in natural vertebrate populations is examined here. Researchers were able to determine the major variables responsible for changing the ratio over a period of 17 years in a population of steelhead trout (""Oncorhynchus mykiss"") from Washington State."
