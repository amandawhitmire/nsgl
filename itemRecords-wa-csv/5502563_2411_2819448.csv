9,Abstract:,"The Arctic until recently was dismissed as a frozen wasteland of interest only to a handful of explorers, traders, missionaries, scientists, and indigenous peoples. Today it is emerging as a major international region of global military, economic, and environmental significance. This is attributable partly to a surge of human activities taking place in the Arctic itself and partly to the linkages between Arctic phenomena and human activities centered in the mid-latitudes. Many of the international issues that have taken shape in the Arctic in the last few decades involve unfamiliar configurations of interests, and it has become clear that the new Arctic agenda can no longer be handled by the old alignments and relationships. This lecture explores the obstacles to and prospects for international cooperation in this region over the next few decades, and discusses which forms of international cooperation will prove most attractive to those with sizable stakes in the Arctic."
