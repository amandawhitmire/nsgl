14,Abstract:,"We report here that BODIPY 505/515, a green lipophilic fluorescent dye, serves as an excellent vital stain for the oil-containing lipid bodies of live algal cells. BODIPY 505/515 vital staining can be used in combination with fluorescent activated cell sorting to detect and isolate algal cells possessing high lipid content."
