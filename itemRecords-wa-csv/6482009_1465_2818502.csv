11,Abstract:,"Newspaper article on why words matter. Terms such as ""red tide"" and ""global warming"" are catchy but lead to misconceptions. For instance ""red tide,"" which is the popularized way of talking about blooms of harmful marine algae. This common terminology is a misnomer because the blooms are not always red and their movement is largely unrelated to tides. Also, many species of algae that cause red discoloration are not harmful."
