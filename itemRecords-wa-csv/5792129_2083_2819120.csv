13,Abstract:,"In this study, Stage 1 larvae of the Dungenes crab ""Cancer magister"" and the shore crab ""Hemigrapsus oregonensis"" were exposed to different prey densities with various periods of access to prey to determine the consequences of limiting access to prey on crab larval survival, development time, and growth. Results show that crab larvae do not require continuous access to prey for optimal development nor do they appear to require light for prey capture. Data obtained from this study help assess sub-optimal diets that can be used experimentally to determine the nutritional contributions made by naturally-â€‹occurring prey organisms during larval development in the two species."
