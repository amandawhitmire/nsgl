7,Abstract:,"The evidence for ocean acidification in the Pacific Northwest is compelling. It consists of published scientific literature representing a large number of laboratory and field observations. The scientific evidence comes from investigations of the natural and anthropogenic (human-​generated) changes to the biogeochemistry of Pacific Northwest waters, responses of organisms to present-day and future conditions, and observations made in aquaculture settings. This fact sheet summarizes our growing understanding of the causes and consequences of ocean acidification in Pacific Northwest marine waters."
