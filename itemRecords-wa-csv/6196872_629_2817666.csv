11,Abstract:,"The Olympia oyster (Ostrea conchaphila) is vulnerable to predation by the invasive Japanese oyster drill (Ocinebrina inornata). In Liberty Bay, the Puget Sound Restoration Fund and The Nature Conservancy are working to facilitate the recruitment of Olympia oysters by adding Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) cultch in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Previous research suggests the presence of Japanese oyster drills in Liberty Bay may pose a significant threat to the restoration of the Olympia oyster population. We are conducting research to test the feasibility of reducing drill densities and to quantify the benefits of drill control for Olympia oysters in the context of this restoration project. We are using a controlled, replicated experiment to compare the cost-​effectiveness of two control methods: (1) visual search and removal of drills from the substrate, and (2) the use of bait (barnacle-​encrusted stakes) to concentrate drills for removal. The experiment is replicated in a pre-existing habitat patch and a recent shell addition area, allowing us to ask whether the costs and benefits of drill control differ for established and colonizing oyster populations. Our results will help to inform the allocation of resources for predator control in native oyster rebuilding efforts. Our preliminary results indicate that there is no significant difference in mean drill density between the control, removal from substrate and removal from bait plots. We predicted that this is due to the small relative scale of the removal and the scale and intensity of the removal would need to be increased to have a significant impact on drill density. We tested these predictions by conducting a drill dispersal experiment to help understand drill movement in the experimental areas in Liberty Bay. Drills were collected, marked and released from a central point. We returned two weeks later to record movement and found that drills traveled meters from the release point. This supports the idea that drill movement is significant and explains why small scale removal may be ineffective. Preliminary conclusions indicate that in addition to increasing prey population (O. Conchaphila), predator density (O. inornata) should be reduced although this proves to be challenging."
