11,Abstract:,"The Cobscook Bay region of eastern Maine is a place where rivers and bays converge with the sea. The area features the highest tides in the eastern United States, abundant marine life, and a rich cultural heritage based on natural resources. Sustainable tourism has been identified as a promising economic development opportunity for Maine and, in particular, Washington County (Flanagan; VRC). Marine recreational fishing is one example of a nature-based activity with potential economic benefit. This fact sheet describes a study of marine recreational fishing activity in the Cobscook Bay region conducted during the summer of 2007. Specific objectives were to estimate the number of fishing trips, describe characteristics of anglers and their trips, and estimate county-level economic impacts generated by the fishing trips."
