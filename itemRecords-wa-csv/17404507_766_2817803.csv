9,Abstract:,"In response to the threat HABs present to human health and shellfish harvests along Puget sound, NOAA created the SoundToxins program in 2006, as part of its Oceans and Human Health Initiative. SoundToxins is designed as a cost-effective citizen-and industry-based monitoring program to provide enough warning of HAB events to enable early or selective harvesting of seafood, which ultimately minimizes health risks and reduces economic losses."
