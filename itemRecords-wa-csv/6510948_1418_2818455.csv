9,Abstract:,"A survey of the estuary at the mouth of the Elwha River and on the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe's reservation (Figure 1) was conducted in February 2013. The survey was conducted to track changes associated with the removal of two dams on the Elwha River. Previous surveys of this estuary complex had been conducted using a variety of methods, including manual measurements of bathymetry using a Real Time Kinematic-​Differential GPS (RTK-DGPS) system. These surveys were time-consuming, and generated relatively few data for the time invested. In addition, the survey methodology introduced unquantifiable uncertainty into bathymetric measurements due to the difficulty of ""feeling"" the soft substrate of the estuary. As a result, there was an interest in applying acoustic technology to collect soundings in the estuary to both increase the density of data collected and improve confidence associated with measurements. A shallow-water single beam sonar system owned by Peninsula College was applied to this problem, and coupled with a RTK-DGPS in an attempt to collect high density and high quality topography and bathymetry data in and adjacent to the estuary complex."
