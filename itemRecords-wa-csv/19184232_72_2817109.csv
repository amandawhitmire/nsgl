9,Abstract:,"Eighty percent of Washington residents live along a 3,000-mile coastline that is physically, culturally and economically shaped by the sea. Washington’s maritime sector employs 57,000 people, generating $15.2 billion in direct revenues, and Washington’s fishing fleets and shell- fish farms produce the nation’s largest, most prized catches and cultured harvests. Washington Sea Grant (WSG) works to assure that state residents understand, protect and prosper from our marine riches and are prepared for coastal hazards. With 25 communicators, educators and field agents located in eight coastal counties whose expertise ranges from oceanography and fisheries to economics and urban planning, WSG is uniquely prepared to serve coastal residents."
