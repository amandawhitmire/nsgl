13,Abstract:,"When the enhancement program in Alaska was initiated in the early 1970s, North American wild Pacific salmon dominated world salmon markets. Since then, there has been a rapid rise in the supply of salmon worldwide. A cost/benefit analysis of the State's enhancement program for salmon indicated that the additional producer's surplus generated by the pink and sockeye hatchery programs are estimated to be less than the costs of running these programs. Eliminating the entire pink or sockeye salmon programs is estimated to increase net benefits by about 8% and 6%, respectively. A 15% increase in either program is estimated to result in a reduction in net benefits and a 15% decrease in either program is estimated to result in a slight increase in net benefits."
