12,Abstract:,"The healing of wounds is a serious problem for sessile unicellular organisms: lacking the ability to recruit or replace cells, they must rely upon the resources of the damaged cell to effect repair. ""Acetabularia acetabulum"" reared in laboratory cultures are subject to wounding during routine handling such as the biweekly media changes which are necessary for these cells to complete development. The goals of this study were (1) to assess the impact of experimentally induced pressure-wounds on the reproductive capacity and development of ""A. acetabulum"", (2) to find ways to mitigate wounding which is an inadvertant consequence of routine cell culture of this alga, and (3) to begin to elucidate the mechanisms of healing in this unicell."
