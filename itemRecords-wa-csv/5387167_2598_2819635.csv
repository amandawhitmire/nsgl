10,Abstract:,"This book on the harvestable shellfish and seaweeds of Puget Sound has been rewritten several times in order to reflect the many changes that have occurred in the shellfish and seaweed industries. We have seen the rapid expansion of new aquaculture crops, the development of shellfish hatcheries, and the beginnings of nori aquaculture in Puget Sound. A heightened awareness and understanding of the fragile nature of the Sound's water quality are also evident. The intent of this book is to describe shellfish and seaweed capture fisheries and aquaculture-​-​past and present. It focuses on the commercial sector and the research, development, and political activities that have influenced these industries."
