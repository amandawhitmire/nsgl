14,Abstract:,Biosensors provide a unique opportunity to couple the sensitivity and selectivity of biological molecules to the convenience of measurement with modern electronic instruments. A general approach to the use of proteins for providing analyte specificity to surface plasmon resonance sensors and other biosensors is discussed. Approaches for identifying and producing the desired proteins are described.
