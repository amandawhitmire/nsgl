11,Abstract:,"As part of a study to assess the aquaculture potential of triploid At?Bn hybrids relative to the widely cultured Atlantic salmon, the authors studied the performance of the hybrids in freshwater and found them to survive and grow at rates generally comparable to those of diploid Atlantic salmon. In this report, they describe the performance (also comparable to diploids) of these fish during the first 376 days of growth after transfer to a saltwater net-pen."
