12,Abstract:,The homologous radioimmunoassa​y system has been developed for the measurement of plasma circulating levels as well as the content of insulin in the pancreatic islets of salmon. The assay entails use of purified coho salmon insulin as standard and isotope-labeled hormone. Specific antibodies were raised by immunization of both rabbits and guinea pigs. The assays revealed a high content of insulin in salmon plasma and gave a good correlation of plasma circulating levels of insulin with nutritional state of tested fish.
