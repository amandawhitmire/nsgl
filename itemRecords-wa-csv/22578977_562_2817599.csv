11,Abstract:,"Understanding human–sea interactions is crucial to developing equitable and sustainable management strategies. In recent years, resource managers and ecosystem scientists have sought to incorporate measures of socioeconomic conditions into their evaluation of coastal and marine systems. This momentum stems from a recognition that “our quest to achieve a healthy and sustainable environment utterly depends on understanding how human well-being is linked to the environment and impacted by our management of it,”1 emphasized Phil Levin, Professor of Practice at the University of Washington and Lead Scientist at The Nature Conservancy of Washington."
