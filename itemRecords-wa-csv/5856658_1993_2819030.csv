11,Abstract:,"There is no consensus in the scientific community about the efficacy of using hatchery fish to enhance ('supplement') the declining wild salmon populations. To predict how hatchery fish will perform relative to wild fish in streams, both the genetic and environmental components must be understood. In this study researchers simulated hatchery supplementation by releasing hatchery-reared coho salmon parr into streams containing naturally rearing coho salmon. The two rearing groups were derived from the same group of parents so differences in survival, growth, and movement could be attributed to early rearing conditions, not genetics. They tested the null hypotheses that the hatchery-reared and naturally reared salmon in the streams had equal rates of survival, growth, and patterns of movement."
