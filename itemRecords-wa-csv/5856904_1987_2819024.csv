12,Abstract:,"Shortraker and rougheye rockfish (""Sebastes borealis"" and ""W. aleutianus"") have been an independent management subgroup of the Gulf of Alaska slope rockfish assemblage since 1991. Special concerns are proposed for the management of these species because they are very slow growing, long-lived, and commercially important. This study investigated the potential role of harvest refugia in the management of these two species by using GIS application to design harvest refugia networks of varying spatial extent. Twenty-year projections employing a population dynamics model were used to compare ending biomass and fishing mortality under the current management system with biomass and fishing mortality under refuge management system. The results indicate that harvest refugia can be used to greatly reduce discards and serial overfishing of substocks without reducing current catch levels."
