9,Abstract:,This thesis focuses on the trophic impacts ecosystems engineers and is an outgrowth of the author's fascination with food production by the most disruptive of ecosystem engineers: Homo sapiens. The ultimate question of the research is to understand the ecological consequences of consumption by certain ecosystem engineers in both space and time. I focus on the pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and a freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium americanum).
