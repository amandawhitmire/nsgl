14,Abstract:,"Transgenic studies demonstrate a role for the DRR49 protein in the disease resistant response of peas. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of DRR49a indicates a protein of 4.79. A search of the GenBank, EMBL, SwissProt and PROSITE databases revealed a number of similar sequences form several genera of plants. Most are described as pollen allergens or inducible pathogenesis-​related proteins of unknown function. However, one related protein from ginseng cultures has associated RNase activity. Transgenic studies are currently underway to further elucidate the role of the DRR49 protein in the disease resistance response."
