11,Abstract:,"This paper examines salmon fishing permit prices in Alaska during 1977-1990 and interprets the relationship between permit prices and expected net earnings in present value model asset pricing. Objectives are (1) to determine whether, over a longer span of time than previously examined, permit prices continue to conform to the theory of asset pricing; (2) to examine differential properties of longer term predictive models for two main classes of salmon fishing gear; and (3) to carefully test empirical models of adaptive expectations of profitability and asset pricing for the presence of serial correlation."
