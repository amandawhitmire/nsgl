11,Abstract:,"This paper addresses the question of how we cope with scientific uncertainty in exploited, complex natural systems such as marine fisheries. Ocean ecosystems are complex and have been very difficult to manage, as evidenced by the collapses of many large-scale fisheries (Boreman et al. 1999; Ludwig et al., 1993; National Research Council, 1999). A large part of the problem arises from scientific uncertainty and our understanding of the nature of that uncertainty. The difficulty of the scientific problem in a complex, quickly changing, and highly adaptive environment such as the ocean should not be underestimated. It has created pervasive uncertainty that has been magnified by the strategic behavior of the various human interests who play in the game of fisheries management. This paper argues that scientific uncertainty in complex systems creates a more difficult conservation problem than necessary because (1) we have built into our governing institutions a very particular and inappropriate scientific conception of the ocean that assumes much more control over natural processes than we might hope to have (i.e., we assume we are dealing with an analog of simple physical systems), and (2) the individual incentives that result from this fiction, even in the best of circumstances, are not aligned with social goals of sustainability. As a result, the author believes we have slowed significantly the process of learning about the ocean, defined scientific uncertainty and precautionary acts in a way that may turn out to be highly risky, and created dysfunctional management institutions. This chapter suggests we are more likely to find ways to align individual incentives with ecosystem sustainability if we begin to view these systems as complex adaptive systems. This perspective alters especially our sense of the extent and kind of control we might exercise in these systems and, as a result, has strong implications for the kinds of individual rights and collective governance structures that might work."
