10,Abstract:,"Every summer when temperatures begin to rise we receive reports of Vibrio parahaemolyticu​s (Vp) illnesses caused by eating shellfish. A Vibrio Control Plan was placed into Chapter 246-282 WAC a number of years ago to help prevent Vp illnesses. The plan specifies temperature control measures during summer months to minimize excessive vibrio growth, and tightens controls when shellfish-​related vibrio illness is reported. This somewhat reactive approach has had some success, but illnesses continue to occur"
