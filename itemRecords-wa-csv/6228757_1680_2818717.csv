14,Abstract:,"Transgeneration​al mass marking of viviparous ﬁsh larvae in vivo was validated by intra-muscular injection of elemental strontium chloride (SrCl2 ) in gestating females and detection of the Sr in the otoliths of developing larvae. All otoliths of brown rockfish Sebastes auriculatus larvae produced from SrCl2 -injected females showed enriched Sr:Ca ratios near the otolith edges, and the signatures did not appear to be affected by the anterior, centre and posterior positions of larvae within the ovary. Results from the present study indicate that transgeneration​al marking is a highly reliable technique for marking large numbers of extremely small viviparous ﬁsh larvae."
