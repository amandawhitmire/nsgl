8,Abstract:,"The powerful planetary perspective of plate tectonics has established the global mid-ocean ridge system as a dynamic manifestation of internal convective processes that control the shape of the ocean basins, the interaction of continents through geologic time, and the physical and chemical evolution of the planet. Consequently, a vigorous attack on the problem of mantle- crust interactions in the ocean basins will drive the earch sciences at a most fundamental level. The RIDGE (Ridge Inter- Disciplinary Global Experiments) initiative is proposed as the vehicle for that attack. It will integrate exploration, experiment and theory in a major effort to understand the primary processes that shape the surface of this planet. As set forth in this document, the RIDGE program is primarily focused on activities that represent new approaches to ridge-crest research or activities that to date have not been effectively implemented within the traditional U.S. funding/researc​h structure."
