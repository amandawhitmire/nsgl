12,Abstract:,"Just as many of the spills on land occur when weekend mechanics change oil and repair their cars, much of the oil-based fluids dumped into our waters are spilled during routine boat maintenance and repairs. This illustrated 8-page brochure, laminated for seaworthiness, shows fishermen and boaters some simple things they can do to help prevent small marine oil spills. It addresses precautions that should be taken before vessel repairs are done, the importance of timely oil changes, selection of proper oil and equipment, reducing the risk of pollution during repairs, and the importance of a careful cleanup. Oil spill response hot line numbers are given."
