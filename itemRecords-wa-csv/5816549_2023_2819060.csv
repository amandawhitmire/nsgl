13,Abstract:,"Both the prevalence and tissue titer of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) increased in Pacific herring ""Clupea pallasi"" following their introduction into net pens (pounds) used in the closed pound spawn-on-kelp (SOK) fishery in Prince William Sound, Alaska. VHSV was also found in water samples from inside and outside the SOK pounds after herring had been confined for several days. Little or no virus was found in free-ranging, spawning herring captured from the vicinity of the pounds, nor did the prevalence of VHSV increase following spawning as it did in impounded herring. Infection was spread within the pounds through waterborne exposure to virus particles originating from impounded fish. Pounds containing predominantly young fish had a higher prevalence of VHSV, suggesting that older fish may be partially immune. Operation of SOK pounds during spawning seasons in which young herring predominate may amplify the disease and possibly exacerbate the population fluctuations observed in wild herring stocks."
