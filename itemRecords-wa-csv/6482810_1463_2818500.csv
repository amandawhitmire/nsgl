9,Abstract:,"Where is high tide? It may not look like it today, but 150 years ago downtown Seattle's shoreline looked like other locations in Puget Sound: wetlands, bluffs, and mudflats lined our waterfront. In fact, the natural shoreline stretched all the way back to present-day First Avenue. And then, like many port cities around the world, Seattle's previous generations built out the shoreline to meet the demands of our growing city. A wharf, a railroad, and deep water piers all contributed to Seattle's economy but also have made it more difficult for underwater habitat to thrive."
