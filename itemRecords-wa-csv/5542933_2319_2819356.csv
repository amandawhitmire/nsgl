9,Abstract:,"A large percentage of current technical information falls into the category of `grey literature' which is difficult to identify and acquire. It is typically unpublished or quasi-published material that cannot be obtained through the usual bookselling channels and is rarely incorporated into the large databases and standard reference sources. How does the `grey literature' get into the government depositories such as NTIS, DTIC, NASA, GPO, Sea Grant and the municipal, state and federal depository libraries? Who is responsible for depositing this material? This paper answers these questions for a non-government, marine research facility and describes some of the responsibilitieâ€‹s librarians must assume to ensure timely dissemination of information through the technical information network."
