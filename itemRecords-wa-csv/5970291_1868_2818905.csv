11,Abstract:,"To achieve partial or complete sterility in order to reduce the possibility of genetic interactions between wild and cultured geoduck populations, it is essential to optimize for triploid yield. While methods of triploidy induction exist and have been optimized for other bivalves, most notably the Pacific oyster, the methods have not been applied to geoduck clams. The objective of this study was to determine optimal methods to produce high yields of triploid geoduck embryos for commercial hatchery production."
