12,Abstract:,"Researchers investigated seasonal and life-long variations of Sr/Ca ratios in shells of ""Mya arenaria"" from Grays Harbor, Washington, and discuss its possible use as an ancillary criterion for age determination. ""Mya arenaria"" was introduced to Grays Harbor (Washington) during the 1880s. Maximum size of members of the extant population is much smaller than that of clams dead ""in situ"" in preceding decades and forming extensive 'death assemblages'. This could reflect differences in growth rate or maximum age (i.e. survival rate). There was a positive, significant correlation between mean Sr/Ca ratio and estimated age at the time of shell formation. Results support the hypothesis that the observed difference in maximum size is due to higher longevity in the extinct population."
