8,Abstract:,"Hatchery techniques for spawning oyster seed hold promise for reversing the decline of natural oyster populations. For example, Washington State oyster growers are now rearing triploid, or sterile, oysters; because these animals divert considerably less energy toward developing reproductive tissue, their body tissue remains firm and appetizing during the summer season. The ability to profitably raise triploids suggests the commercial possibility of breeding oysters with a variety of other traits, for example, oysters that are able to resist disease or grow to maturity before they succumb to disease. This article examines the development of West Coast hatchery technology and the all-season triploid oyster, the problems of oyster disease in Chesapeake and Delaware bays, and the prospects of ongoing research to understand and combat disease."
