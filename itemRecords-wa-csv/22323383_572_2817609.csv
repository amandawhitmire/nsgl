11,Abstract:,"These proceedings summarize a workshop held October 5-6, 1999, to discuss the role of marine biotechnology in preventing degradation of the environment as well as in remediation and restoration. The agenda is reprinted in Appendix A. Each speaker summarized the current state of knowledge for each topic and highlighted the research needs in each area. Participants discussed the development of strategies for preventing or inhibiting biofilm development, remediation of oil spills and of marsh pollution, restoration of coral reefs, and the effects of heavy metals, overgrowth of microbes, and algal blooms. They also highlighted our critical knowledge gaps. Any advice, findings, conclusions, or recommendations are strictly those of the author and do not reflect a consensus of the workshop as a whole. In addition to the speakers, those attending the workshop included representatives from the National Science Foundation, National Sea Grant Program of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Electric Power Research Institute, and Department of Energy, all of whom were sponsors of the workshop. We are indebted to these institutions for their sponsorship of the project and for their input during the workshop.This 2-day workshop is the culmination of a study of the status and future of marine biotechnology. The overall goal of this workshop is to examine what was initially called “Opportunities for Marine Biotechnology in the United States,” to consider where we are now in this field of “Environmental Marine Biotechnology,” to envision the field in the future, and to discuss any impediments that might be encountered along the way. We hope that participants will address the question of where the federal government should invest its limited funds and what future initiatives should be planned. The agencies that initially commissioned this study were the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Sea Grant College Program, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and Electric Power Research Institute. The reports that follow highlight the most recent research results and leading edge ideas for applying the tools of biotechnology to the study of the marine environment. The discussions will surely help the responsible federal agencies to plan for future opportunities in research and applications of marine biotechnology."
