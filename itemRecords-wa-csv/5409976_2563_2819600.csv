11,Abstract:,"Non-host resistance, whereby a given plant species is able to resist most of the potentially pathogenic microorganisms it encounters, can be overcome only by a very small number of `true pathogens' which can use that plant as a host. In some cases, plants have developed mechanisms for overcoming infection by specific races or strains of a true pathogen. This race-specific resistance can be easily manipulated into agronomically important cultivars by plant breeders. Nine cDNA clones which represent pea genes active during non-host resistance against the fungus ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli"" have been previously described. In the present work, these cDNAs have been used as probes to compare non-host resistance with race-specific responses of peas against three races of ""Pseudomonas syringae"" pv. ""pisi""."
