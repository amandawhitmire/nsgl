9,Abstract:,"This dissertation is an investigation of ecological relationships between Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and riparian forests along the streams in which they spawn. My primary goals were to derive a mechanistic understanding of the pathways and fate of salmon nutrients in riparian forests, and then, in light of the mechanistic work, to evaluate dendroecologica​l methods for reconstructing salmon abundance. A pilot study, Chapter I, provided initial evidence of positive relationships between salmon abundance and tree-ring growth. This prompted investigation of processes regulating availability of salmon nutrients to riparian trees. In Chapter II, I used a case study to examine the products and dynamics of salmon carcass decay. At least 49.3% of carcass N was contributed to soils, and the N moved laterally through soils at least 50 cm. The quick decay of soft tissues and slow decay of bones results in bioavailability of NH4+ within weeks, NO3- within months, and P and Ca+2 over months to years. In Chapter 111, I used a 15N tracer study to quantify the fate and movement of a late-season N pulse in a riparian plant-soil system. Western red cedar roots began to take up trace N almost immediately, and uptake continued throughout the winter. By spring, approx. 34% of the tracer N was found in trees, and tracer N was reallocated to aboveground pools. Most of the remaining tracer N was bound in soil organic matter, and - 79% of the tracer N was retained in the plots for one year. The mechanistic studies showed that riparian trees can acquire and use salmon-derived N within one year. In Chapter IV, I tested potential relationship between tree- ring 615N and salmon abundance. Interpretation of tree-ring 515N was fundamentally compromised by the presence of sap, and even when sap was removed, patterns in tree-ring 615N attributable to salmon were seen at only the coarsest scale. In Chapter V, I expanded the pilot study investigation to 9 additional systems. I identified relationships between tree-ring growth and salmon escapement at 5 sites, and used these relationships to reconstruct salmon abundance over 150-350 years. Tree-ring- based salmon abundance reconstructions presented here are novel."
