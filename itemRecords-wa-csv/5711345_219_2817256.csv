14,Abstract:,"Silver has a long history of varied uses in society. Yet, very little useful information on environmental concentrations, chemical forms and biological effects are available. This conference provided a forum for the presentation of up-to-date research results on sources, biogeochemistry​, environmental cycling and biological effects of silver in the environment. Speakers were chosen from a wide cross-section of scientific disciplines. The conference objectives were to synthesize current knowledge and to identify information needs necessary to more accurately interpret environmental behavior and potential impacts of silver. This year there was special emphasis on chemical and biological behavior of silver in the water column and in sediments. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. The occurrence and behavior of silver in natural waters. A.W. Andren, et al. p. 7-10. 2. Effect of water quality parameters on silver availability. G. P. Cobb, et al. p. 11-17. 3.
