13,Abstract:,"The peaceful hiking trails of the Theler Wetlands at the head of Hood Canal are alive with marsh grasses, blue heron, and bald eagles. In the fall, salmon wash up in the marsh after spawning. The peace and tranquility of this popular preserve and walking trails belie their history of strong shaking, sudden land-level change, and tsunamis that have rocked the marsh in the past. The coastal wetlands of the Salish Sea are rich, diverse habitats, and they are an important focus of coastal ecosystem restoration efforts in our region. However, unknown to many visitors to coastal wetlands, they often preserve in their sediments a rich history of past earthquakes, tsunamis, and strong ground shaking."
