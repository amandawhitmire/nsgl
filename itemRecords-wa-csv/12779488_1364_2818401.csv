16,Abstract:,"MPA policy implementation in Puget Sound appears to be a mixture of successes and failures. Informants indicated repeatedly that there was a lack of leadership for the policy at the highest managerial and political levels that limited policy implementation. Most informants thought that serious challenges afflicted MPA management in Puget Sound: managers asserted they required more staff; monitoring for effectiveness was lacking; MPA goal formulation should be improved; and the involvement of tribal co-managers was minimal. These variables coincide neatly with Sabatier and Mazmanian’s (1980) framework for policy implementation and lead to the conclusion that the effectiveness of Puget Sound MPAs can be improved. Many scientists reported that they were optimistic that MPAs can serve groundfish management well by creating refugia for depressed fish stocks. Other informants thought that the bottom-up site selection process, though needing to be guided by scientific information, generally offered stakeholders an appropriate forum for participating in resource management."
