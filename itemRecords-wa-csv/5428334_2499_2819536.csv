12,Abstract:,"The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) industry on the U.S. west coast relies heavily on hatcheries for its seed. As such, the possibility exists for developing of selective breeding programs; however, inbreeding depression due to crossing of close relatives exists as a potential problem. On an experimental basis in four years of breeding with C. gigas, it was found that two-year-old progeny from first generation brother-sister matings were smaller in shell size and wet and dry meat weights than those from outbred or control stocks. Effects of inbreeding should be considered in designing any shellfish hatchery breeding scheme."
