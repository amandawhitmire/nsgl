9,Abstract:,"While the application of biotechnology based on terrestrial organisms has been expanding quickly, it is only recently that biotechnologicaâ€‹l research and development in the marine sciences has received concerted attention. Opportunities in the marine sciences for product enhancement and disease control through development of sophisticated aquaculture techniques and for the production of novel pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals are vast. Similarly, new approaches for control of industrial and municipal pollution by genetic manipulation of organisms or controlled alterations in degradative enzyme capabilities offer serious challenges and opportunities; successful outcomes may yet alter the pollution stress paradox in our favor. Further investigation of biofouling and corrosion at the molecular and organismal interaction levels holds great promise in the eventual development of controls, with none of the consequences associated with painting submerged surfaces with various toxicants. A brief summary of emerging areas in marine biotechnology is presented here."
