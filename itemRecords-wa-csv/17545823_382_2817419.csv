10,Abstract:,"Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is a public process of analyzing and allocating the spatial and temporal distribution of human activities in marine environments to achieve ecological, economic, and social objectives. The goals of the plan are to protect existing uses, protect cultural uses and resources, preserve the environment, integrate the plan into existing decision-​-​‐making, and provide new economic opportunities. As part of the MSP process, Washington Sea Grant (WSG) is developing economic indicators to measure a wide range of important factors associated with human economic wellbeing and the health of regional economies. When it comes to economic indicators, there is no single number that provides a comprehensive measure of a region’s economic health or addresses all of a community’s concerns. To answer questions about economic health, it is typically necessary to evaluate multiple economic indicators that help you to understand different pieces of the economy. By looking at all of the pieces together, y In order to determine the appropriate economic indicators that measure the economic health of a region, multiple steps were taken. A review of the literature was completed to determine the measures most frequently used and referenced in textbooks, peer reviewed journal articles, and popular internet sites. Interviews were held with local economic development council (EDC) directors and a list was requested from them of currently used measures. A comprehensive list was developed from these resources and consolidated to remove redundancy. ou can begin to develop a more comprehensive assessment of the economic health of the region."
