16,Abstract:,"The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has undertaken a research and development program to establish a commercial seaweed aquaculture industry utilizing the marine waters of Washington. While research is being performed to determine the biological feasibility of the commercial culture of Porphyra, and the suitability of various sites, it must be simultaneously shown that the product can be produced economically and then marketed successfully. This report has collected and analyzed information about a new potential industry for Washington. This information will allow DNR to better manage the public lands and associated marine resources of Washington and will also allow potential nori farmers and investors to evaluate their potential for nori aquaculture. It must be emphasized that this is a preliminary economic analysis. No nori farm yet exists in the U.S. and so the information about equipment and costs was gleened from Japanese industry expertise. The use of this information in this report is at the user's own risk. DNR makes no guarantee of the accuracy or correctness of the information contained in the report."
