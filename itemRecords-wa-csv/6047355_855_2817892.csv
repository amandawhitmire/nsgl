12,Abstract:,"Funded by Washington Sea Grant, the study of local marine bird species repeats key elements of marine bird census work conducted in the late 1970s as part of Marine Ecosystems Analysis Puget Sound Project (MESA). The MESA study, directed by Bellingham's Terry Wahl and Steven Spiech, was the first comprehensive census of marine birds in northwestern Washington. The objective of our study is to compare our census data with the 1970s MESA census data to provide insight into changes in local marine bird abundance over the past 25 years. Results from the first year of our study have shown disturbing declines for many species in this area. In this second part of our two-part series, we focus on the changes we are seeing in one local body of water-Drayton Harbor."
