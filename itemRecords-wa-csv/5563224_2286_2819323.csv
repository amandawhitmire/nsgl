11,Abstract:,"Biological marks that occur naturally can be used in analyses of mixed populations. If distinctive genetic differences among populations do not exist naturally, they may be bred into one or more of the populations. That process, known as intentional genetic marking, is the focus of this paper. When a genetic marking program is planned, several questions must be addressed, including how to choose a marker allele and how to evaluate its performance. In this paper quantitative guidelines are provided for choosing appropriate marker alleles, and how to examine the selective neutrality of a marker allele is described."
