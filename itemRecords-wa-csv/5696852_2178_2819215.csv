8,Abstract:,"Seabirds and marine mammals are taken as bycatch in the commercial gillnet fisheries in Puget Sound and throughout the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. Of immediate concern is the incidental capture of marbled murrelets (""Brachyamphus marmoratus'), listed as a threatened species in Washington State under the Endangered Species Act. Other seabirds are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA); some are inadvertently captured and killed by commercial net fisheries. Unlike the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the MBTA has no provision for the incidental capture of protected species in net fisheries. Such takings are a misdemeanor offense and may result in seizure of the vessel. The goal of this pilot study was to begin to identify and develop methods to reduce or eliminate the incidental capture of seabirds in gillnet salmon fisheries without significantly reducing fishing efficiency."
