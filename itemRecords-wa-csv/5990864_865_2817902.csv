15,Abstract:,"On October 22, 2003 USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) approved Alaska salmon and Washington salmon for TAA (Trade Adjustment Assistance) benefits. Salmon permit holders and possibly their crew members who caught salmon during 2002 became eligible for TAA benefits. This manual was created as a text used for training purposes. It was compiled from many sources and resources to acquaint fishermen with the benefits extended to them under the TAA program."
