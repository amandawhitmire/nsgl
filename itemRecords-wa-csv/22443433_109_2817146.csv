19,Abstract:,"One of the objectives of the WCRP is to develop an updated assessment of projected sea level change for coastal Washington State and its relationship to coastal hazards such as flooding and erosion. Washington State has two previous assessments of sea level rise; one published in 2012 by the National Academies of Science (NRC, 2012), and another in 2008 (Mote et al., 2008). This report provides an updated set of sea level rise projections that incorporates the latest science, provides community-​scale projections, and is designed for direct application to risk management and planning. Subsequent reports will describe new findings related to storm surge, waves, and efforts to integrate sea level rise in coastal planning and management. Washington’s coastal areas and marine waters are not only an important economic engine for the state but also provide an important sense of place and figure irreplaceably in the traditions and cultures of tribal communities. The state’s coastlines also provide valuable ecosystem services that support human and natural communities alike. Sea level rise will exacerbate existing risks and vulnerabilities​, such as shoreline and coastal bluff erosion, storm surge, flooding, and groundwater intrusion. This assessment provides new up-to-date projections for use in coastal habitat restoration, community and land-use planning, and infrastructure design and operations."
