11,Abstract:,"The primary objective of this project was to analyze long-term trends in Puget Sound marine fishes based on a synthesis of the available data. A secondary objective was to establish baselines against which future fish monitoring efforts could be compared and evaluated. An additional benefit of the project was the identification of the collection methods used over the years, which can be used to help define standardized methods so that future investigations can be conducted in a compatible fashion."
