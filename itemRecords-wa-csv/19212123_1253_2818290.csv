17,Abstract:,"We studied the effects of light intensity on larvalactivity, feeding behaviour, growth and survival ofa candidate species for aquaculture – sablefish(Anopl​opoma fimbria). Of six light intensities rangingfrom 2 to 750 lux at the water surface, thegreatest surviving biomass in small tanks wasobserved at 12–42 lux. In another experiment inlarger tanks, behavioural observations showedthat larvae fed poorly under light brighter than800 lux but fed better at lower light intensities,dep​ending on tank type. In a separate experiment,wher​e live feed densities were varied between 2.5and 17.5 rotifers per mL of tank water, survivingbiomas​s and dry weight increased with higher feeddensities. These experiments help refine methodsfor rearing larval sablefish by demonstrating effectsof light intensity and feed density on larval performance."
