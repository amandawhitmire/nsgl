8,Abstract:,"Each year, Maryland Sea Grant reflects on our many accomplishments​ in research, education, and outreach, and our valuable partnerships. This year, we highlight our Sea Grant Extension agents and their partners for their critical and impressive efforts to increase sustainability ​ in the Chesapeake and coastal bays. Our Sea Grant Extension watershed specialists implement practices to reduce runoff and help communities create and maintain stormwater management infrastructure. Our aquaculture extension agents help the industry continue to grow and thrive. Our seafood specialist advises industry to make sure the fish and shellfish we eat are safe. Our fisheries economist advises local and regional policy makers on fisheries management. Our Chesapeake Bay Sentinel Site Cooperative coordinator translates scientific data into products that increase communities’ resilience to coastal storms, erosion, and flooding. Our extension agents’ work is possible in part by Maryland Sea Grant-supported research. Maryland scientists advance understanding in our region and inform policy decisions. Research highlights include guiding restoration of the Chesapeake Bay’s submerged grasses and exploring coastal flooding patterns to assist climate change adaptation decisions. Maryland Sea Grant’s education leader brings together scientists and high school students to investigate biofilms and showcase aquatic biodiversity in city harbors in the U.S. and Europe. Maryland Sea Grant fellowships have a diverse cohort of undergraduate and graduate marine scientists. Our Knauss fellows spend a year in Washington, D.C. learning about the integration of science and policy. Our Centro TORTUGA undergraduate students in Puerto Rico — even after the devastation of Hurricane Maria — remain committed to studying the island’s coastal ecosystems."
