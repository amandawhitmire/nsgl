12,Abstract:,"Plastid genomes of two rhodophytes (""Porphyra yezoensis"" and ""Griffithsia pacifica"") and two chromophytes (""Olisthodiscus luteus"" and ""Ochromonas danica"") were compared with one another and with green plants in terms of overall structure, gene complement and organization. Comparison of the entire plastid genomes suggests that despite differences in gene organization, there remain overall similarities in architecture, gene content, and gene sequences among the three lineages. These similarities are discussed with reference to the ancestry of the different plastid types."
