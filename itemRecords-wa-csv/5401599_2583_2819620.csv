10,Abstract:,"Because of the short time span between the appearance of clinical signs of vitamin B6 deficiency and death in fish, there is a need for rapid and early detection of a deficiency. This study was thus undertaken to compare the vitamin B6 status of rainbow trout by the direct measurement of pyridoxine and pyridoxal and by measuring the activity of a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme from liver tissue of rainbow trout fed a pyridoxine-â€‹deficient diet. Results show that vitamin B6 deficiency in rainbow trout can be readily determined weeks before clinical signs of a deficiency are apparent by measuring pyridoxine- enhanced liver ASAT activity. However, liver levels of pyridoxine and pyridoxal are not sensitive indicators of vitamin B6 status."
