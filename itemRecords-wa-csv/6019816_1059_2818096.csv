10,Abstract:,"Economics teaches the behavioral lesson that people respond to the incentives they face and are, for the most part, rational in what they do. In this way, the economics of fisheries and their management are interrelated. The relationship stems from the signals management provides, the incentives those signals create, and the behavioral responses caused by those incentives. The incentives created by fishery management encourage managers and fishermen to take short-term perspectives and act against long-term ecological and economic interests. Their actions create costs for management that affect its performance. A precondition for improving fishery management is to contain these costs."
