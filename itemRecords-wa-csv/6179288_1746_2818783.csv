15,Abstract:,"Internet access provides the technological capability for new forms of rapid data acquisition. We now can make stock assessments simultaneously from multiple remote or widely diffuse locations using teams of observers. To organize observations over large areas, we have recruited, assembled, and trained a diverse team of citizen scientists from many different communities and organizations across the state of California. Information and communications between individuals and across the entire group can be readily disseminated by electronic mail and frequent web-based updates. Monitoring schedules and sign-ups for specific sites and times are managed electronically via pages on the web. Data observations, sightings, and comments can be directly entered into a database using interactive web‐based questionnaires and e‐mail. Our methods are particularly applicable when the species of interest is unique and readily identifiable by nonscientists, as is the case for beach‐spa​wning populations of the California grunion Leuresthes tenuis. This large, successful multi‐yea​r state‐wid​e assessment program has led to increased public awareness of this species and improved management efforts to protect and conserve their spawning grounds. We suggest that in the future, these methods could potentially be tailored for a variety of different situations and species. As an example, we are developing a small, pilot project for opportunistic sightings of Humboldt squid, Dosidicus gigas in an effort to tack its northward migrations."
