13,Abstract:,"Context and Research Questions: The Columbia River Estuary (CRE) extends 146 river miles from the Bonneville Dam to the Pacific Ocean. Accelerated population growth in southwest Washington has led to large changes in land use within the lower Columbia River watershed, which has likely impacted the dynamics of nutrient flux into the CRE with implications for primary productivity and plankton populations. In addition, the CRE has experienced several critical introductions of non-native zooplankton taxa resulting in significant ecological impacts.The CRESCENDO project partners Washington State University Vancouver (WSUV) science and education faculty with five SW Washington high school teachers and their students in a unique research collaboration focused on human and natural systems in the CRE and surrounding watershed.We are investigating two overarching research questions:• What are the links between upstream watershed processes, land use practices, and downstream estuarine health, as indicated by nutrients, harmful algal species and invasive zooplankton in the CRE?• What are the links between high school students’ understanding of CRE ecology, their participation in authentic scientific research, and their perceptions of and attitudes toward the CRE landscape?"
