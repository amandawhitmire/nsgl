11,Abstract:,WSU Whatcom County Extension entered into a contract with City of Bellingham Public Works Division to provide community outreach education about residential landscaping practices with a focus on stormwater management and water conservation in March of 2016. Education and outreach are crucial to the success of these public works programs. An informed and knowledgeable community with greater understanding of the reasons why it is necessary to manage storm water and conserve potable water builds public support for programs and leads to greater compliance. This community outreach effort (Gardening Green) moves residents through a continuum from basic awareness to implementation of on-the-ground changes that address these management goals to becoming partners in the education and outreach of other community members.
