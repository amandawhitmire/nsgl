17,Abstract:,"Shoreline armoring is widespread in many parts of the protected inland waters of the Pacific Northwest,U.S.A​, but impacts on physical and biological features of local nearshore ecosystems have only recentlybegun to be documented. Armoring marine shorelines can alter natural processes at multiple spatial andtemporal scales; some, such as starving the beach of sediments by blocking input from upland bluffs maytake decades to become visible, while others such as placement loss of armoring construction are immediate.We quantified a range of geomorphic and biological parameters at paired, nearby armored andunarmored beaches throughout the inland waters of Washington State to test what conditions andparameters are associated with armoring.We gathered identical datasets at a total of 65 pairs of beaches:6 in South Puget Sound, 23 in Central Puget Sound, and 36 pairs North of Puget Sound proper. At thisbroad scale, demonstrating differences attributable to armoring is challenging given the high naturalvariabil​ity in measured parameters among beaches and regions. However, we found that armoring wasconsistently associated with reductions in beach width, riparian vegetation, numbers of accumulatedlogs​, and amounts and types of beach wrack and associated invertebrates. Armoring-​related patterns atlower beach elevations (further vertically from armoring) were progressively harder to detect. For someparameters, such as accumulated logs, there was a distinct threshold in armoring elevation that wasassociated with increased impacts. This large dataset for the first time allowed us to identify cumulativeimpac​ts that appear when increasing proportions of shorelines are armored. At large spatial and temporalscales, armoring much of a sediment drift cell may result in reduction of the finer grain-​sizefractions on beaches, including those used by spawning forage fish. Overall we have shown that localimpacts of shoreline armoring can scale-up to have cumulative and threshold effects – these should beconsidered when managing impacts to public resources along the coast."
