11,Abstract:,"Evidence is presented and reviewed of gene activity in the pea host, following challenge by both a bean and a pea pathogen. Many aspects of the bean pathogen-pea endocarp interaction have been well characterized, most notably the action of chitosan as an elicitor. Some aspects of the pea pathogen-pea interaction remain to be clarified, primarily the means by which the pathogen can turn off the disease resistance response genes (DRRG) and successfully colonize the tissue. Here it is shown that the same DRRG are active in a race-specific manner in certain pea differential lines when the host is challenged by the live ""Pseudomonas syringae"" pv. ""pisi"" (Psp) races but are activated non-​specifically when challenged by isolated Psp cell walls alone. Relatively low expression of the DRRG occurs in the susceptible reaction of the pea-pea pathogen at time periods when fungal growth rapidly accelerates; lower copy numbers of those mRNAs are observed following resistance-​breaking heat treatments."
