11,Abstract:,"A stochastic population dynamics modelling framework that incorporated a hypothesized relationship between an environmental variable and process error in life history parameters was developed for a cetacean population. A method was adopted that integrated an index of sea-ice, which has been hypothesized to pertain to calf production, into the stock assessment for the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales. In addition to stochastic birth rates, the framework also allowed for stochasticity in survival rates, and was fit to an index of strandings to capture the dynamics observed during the mortality event of 1999 and 2000. Sensitivity tests were performed to evaluate the consequences of various assumptions. The results of this framework were compared to those based on a deterministic model that was only fit to the abundance data. These alternatives were each able to fit the abundance data well, but led to different interpretations with regards to current depletion and other quantities of interest. The framework developed here can be used as an operating model with which to test the gray whale SLA, given climate forecasts and hypotheses regarding environmental impacts on population dynamics."
