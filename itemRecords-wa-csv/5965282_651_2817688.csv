12,Abstract:,"As other authors have done, these researchers used fishery landings data to compute the long-term average contribution of 1+ juvenile crab populations reared in estuaries to future coastal fisheries in Oregon and Washington. They grouped landings of Dungeness crab ""Cancer magister"" in two large geographic zones by combining fishery ports as adjacent to Large Estuarine Zones (LEZ; Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay, and both sides of the Columbia River) and Small Estuarine Zones (SEZ; all other ports in Oregon). Mortality estimates were used to reduce 1+ crab abundance to surviving legal males, and portrayed as percent of the fisheries. Trends in the SEZ indicate that an average of only about 5-7 percent of estuarine production adds to coastal adult population. The contribution is 25-30 percent in the LEZ (or higher). The data indicate that estuarine juvenile production provides a relatively stable source of recruits to coastal adult populations, and large systems in the LEZ are important nurseries. Since direct coastal settlement of larvae does occur but is highly variable, the estuarine contribution may be especially important when physical forcing or unusual events lead to low survival of the coastal 0+ cohort."
