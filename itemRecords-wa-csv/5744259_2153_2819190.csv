11,Abstract:,"The Skokomish River and its delta comprise a compact, esily studied system. Two minor alterations-​-​diking of a small area of peripheral marshes and blockage or partial blockage of some peripheral channels--and two relatively lrge changes-​-​removal of 40% of the freshwater inflow and logging of a large fraction of one sub-basin--have occurred which have implications for the sediment budget of the system. The authors focus on impacts of flow diversion by examining historical changes in deltaic bathymethry and habitat. (The perturbing effects of logging can be largely neglected in this analysis for several reasons. Results presented show that loss of transport capacity, not the actual change in sediment supply, has been the decisive factor in these historical changes. These circumstances render the Skokomish a good natural laboratory in which to study downstream effects of water withdrawal on estuaries."
