He established a cooperative partnership program between Washington Sea Grant and the American Association of Port Authorities, through which Dowd, a self-professed 'trouble-​shooter' for the industry, provided assistance to virtually every major port in North America and several in other parts of the globe. This newsletter reviews his career."
