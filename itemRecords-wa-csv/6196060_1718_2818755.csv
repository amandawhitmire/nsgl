12,Abstract:,"This study investigated temperature effects on depuration for reducing Vibrio parahaemolyticu​s and Vibrio vulnificus in American oyster (Crassostrea virginica). Raw oysters were inoculated with 5-strain cocktail of V. parahaemolyticu​s or V. vulnificus to levels of 10^4 to 10^5 MPN (most probable number)/g and depurated in artificial seawater (ASW) at 22, 15, 10, and 5 deg. C. Depuration of oysters at 22 deg. C had limited effects on reducing V. parahaemolyticu​s or V. vulnificus in the oysters. Populations of V. parahaemolyticu​s and V. vulnificus were reduced by 1.2 and 2.0 log MPN/g, respectively, after 48 h of depuration at 22 deg. C. Decreasing water temperature to 15 deg. C increased the efficacy of depuration in reducing V. parahaemolyticu​s and V. vulnificus in oysters. Reductions of V. parahaemolyticu​s and V. vulnificus in oysters increased to 2.1 and 2.9 log MPN/g, respectively, after 48 h of depuration at 15 deg. C. However, depurations at 10 and 5 deg. C were less effective than at 15 deg. C in reducing the Vibrio spp. in oysters. Extended depuration at 15 deg. C for 96 h increased reductions of V. parahaemolyticu​s and V. vulnificus in oysters to 2.6 and 3.3 log MPN/g, respectively."
