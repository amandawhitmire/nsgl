10,Abstract:,"One of the great treasures of Puget sound is the abundance of intertidal clams and oysters that can be readily harvested. Digging clams and gathering oysters with family and friends can provide hours of enjoyment and a nutritious source of food. This publication is designed for shoreline homeowners interested in raising shellfish on their beaches. It introduces a variety of methods available to seed a beach with shellfish or to enhance it so that more shellfish will live there naturally. Even if you have never gathered shellfish on your beach before, with a little effort and the right conditions, you may have clams and oysters growing in the future."
