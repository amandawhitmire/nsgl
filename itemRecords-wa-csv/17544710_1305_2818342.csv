12,Abstract:,"Following a review of stakeholder inputs, we propose a box layout for the EcoWin.NET ecological model of 76 boxes, with 38 boxes in the upper water column layer and 38 boxes in the lower layer. The detailed analysis, results, and their justification, are presented in the text. This document reviews the comments of various stakeholders on the EcoWin.NET model box division for PESCA. Stakeholder views and comments were analyzed and organized into a table where the main concerns were the box sizes in the inlets and coves because they have different characteristics in the mouth and shallow heads. For a better understanding of proposals maps were made to visualize the box boundaries where changes were suggested."
