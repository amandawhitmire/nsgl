9,Abstract:,"One of the problems with hydroacoustic techniques for estimation of fish populations is the need to determine the effective sampling angle of the hydroacoustic beam. The duration-​in-​beam is an empirical technique for estimation of the effective sampling angle of a hydroacoustic beam. The technique potentially allows estimation of fish densities without the usual requirements for system calibration and target strength information. When the method was applied to 50 hydroacoustic surveys, results showed reasonable consistency in the beam angle measurement and indicated that the technique was not subject to the estimation errors usually associated with uncertainty in the acoustic system calibration and target strength parameters."
