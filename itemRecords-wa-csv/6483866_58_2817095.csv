9,Abstract:,"The geoduck (Panopea generosa) is North America's largest burrowing clam. It can be found in soft intertidal and subtidal marine habitats in the northeast Pacific Ocean to depths of more than 200 feet. In Washington state this large clam has been cultured since 1991 and on a commercial scale since 1996. Today geoduck harvesting in Washington and British Columbia is an $80 million industry, with Washington supplying nearly half of the world's demand through wild and farmed operations. Aquaculture contributions to the annual state harvest have grown steadily and now total around 1.3 million pounds per year or 90% of global geoduck aquaculture production. While the clams are a valuable resource that can fetch $100 or more per pound overseas, until recently, little scientific information was available on the ecological impacts of common culture practices. In 2007, the Washington Legislature enacted Second Substitute House Bill 2220 (Chapter 216, Laws of 2007) to commission studies assessing possible effects of geoduck aquaculture on the Puget Sound and Strait of Juan de Fuca environments. The bill called on Washington Sea Grant, based at the University of Washington (UW), to establish a six-year research program, reporting the results back to the Legislature by December 1, 2013. The following final report summarizes the results of the commissioned research studies, provides an overview of program activities and recommends future research and monitoring to support sustainable management of geoduck aquaculture in Washington state."
