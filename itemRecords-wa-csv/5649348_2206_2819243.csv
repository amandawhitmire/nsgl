11,Abstract:,"The demand by the general public for eductional programs offered at aquariums and museums has increased dramatically within the last five years. Project Marine Discovery, initiated during the 1987-1988 academic year, was designed as a unique, field trip experience to acquaint precollege students with the plants, animals, habitats, and processes of the marine environment through a series of rotating sessions especially designed for the visiting age group. Over the last four years, six additional educational programs have been developed and implemented as a direct result of the original program. These interactive learning experiences are putting excitement back into science, and allowing program participants to augment both their knowledge and critical thinking skills."
