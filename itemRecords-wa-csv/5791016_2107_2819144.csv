14,Abstract:,"Most documented temperature-​related pressure responses are in deep-sea hyperthermophil​ic isolates. In order to determine whether protein thermostabiliza​tion by pressure is restricted to species from the deep ocean, the authors studied the pressure response of DNA polymerases from three thermophilic species: ""Pyrococcus"" strain ES4 (isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent), ""P. furiosus"" (from shallow marine hot springs), and ""Thermus aquaticus"" (from terrestrial hot springs). DNA polymerases were thermally stressed using the 'winerack' pressure system and the remaining enzyme activity was followed through time to determine inactivation rates at denaturing temperatures and increasing pressures."
