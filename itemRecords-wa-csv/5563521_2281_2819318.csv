12,Abstract:,"The presence of two chemically distinct gonadotropins (GTH I and GTH II) in salmonids has been well established. Since all hormonal actions are preceded by the binding of the hormone to its specific receptor(s), the affirmation of two GTHs in salmonids naturally brought about some basic questions concerning their receptors. This study was designed to optimize binding conditions of salmon gonadotropins to membrane preparations of salmon gonadal tissues. Results suggest the presence of some shared and some separate binding sites for the two gonadotropins."
