12,Abstract:,"Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") megalopae recruit to northeastern Pacific coastal estuaries, and settle into intertidal and subtidal habitats where they molt into Early Benthic Phase (EBP) crabs, and are dependent on epibenthic structure for shelter from predation. Given the importance of shell refuge to their post-settlement ontogeny, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began constructing intertidal plots of oyster shell in the Grays Harbor estuary, Washington, to enhance recruitment and mitigate losses of subtidal ""C. magister"" entrained and killed during extensive dredging efforts. When shell habitat was newly constructed, settlement and survival of ""C. magister"" were high, and expectations for the mitigation project were met. During the first several years (1992-1997), plots greater than 1 yr post-​construction were colonized by yellow shore crabs, ""Hemigrapsus oregonensis"" (often greater than or equal to 75 crabs m^-2), and abundance of EBP ""C. magister"" was reduced to nearly zero. While some predation of settling megalopae by ""H. oregonensis"" does occur, the relationship between these species is characterized by density-​dependent competitive interactions. Laboratory observations of competition for shell habitat indicate that ""H. oregonensis"" are dominant over EBP ""C. magister"" and can evict ""C. magister"" from refuge spaces. Field experiments show that high densities of the former cause the latter to emigrate from shell, and suggest detection and avoidance of areas with high densities of ""H. oregonensis"" by settling ""C. magister"" megalopae. More recently (1998�2001), abundance of ""H. oregonensis"" has declined dramatically within plots of oyster shell, apparently due to recruitment failure, and patterns of ""C. magister"" abundance and production have returned to levels consistent with original expectations of the mitigation project. Both intraspecific and interspecific competition for space are significant factors effecting population regulation of ""C. magister"" when they are strongly dependent on refuge from predation. Efficacy of constructed oyster shell plots as a mitigation tool may hinge on the population dynamics of a species previously considered of little consequence to the target species."
