10,Abstract:,"The nonhost response of pea tissue to ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""pisi"", a pathogen of peas, and ""F. solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli"", a pathogen of beans, has been characterized in terms of the mRNA and protein species that selectively accumulate or whose synthesis is enhanced following inoculation. It is of importance for further biochemical definition of resistance responses to obtain a pea system in which race-specific resistance responses could be compared with those of nonhost resistance. This paper characterizes interactions between five lines of peas that react differently to three races of ""Pseudomonas syringae"" pv. ""pisi"". The accumulation of phytoalexins and yellow-green pigmentation adjacent to the inoculum have been associated with a hypersensitive type of resistance. Both of these changes are most intense in cultivars of pea resistant to the nonpathogenic fungi and avirulent races of the pathogen."
