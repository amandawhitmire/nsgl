14,Abstract:,"The single recombinant expressing the ""Streptomyces coelicolor"" minimal ""whiE"" (spore pigment) polyketide synthase (PKS) is uniquely capable of generating a large array of well more than 30 polyketides, many of which, so far, are novel to this recombinant. The characterized polyketides represent a diverse set of molecules that differ in size (chain length) and shape (cyclization pattern). This combinatorial biosynthetic library is, by far, the largest and most complex of its kind described to date and indicates that the minimal ""whiE"" PKS does not independently control polyketide chain length nor dictate the first cyclization event."
