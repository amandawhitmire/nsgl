8,Abstract:,"An issue that will arise with increasing frequency is the long-term commitment of ocean space to a particular use: oil and gas production; mineral extraction; sanctuaries; research stations; mariculture; recreation; waste disposal; energy production; etc. Each of these uses requires that a site be selected and alternative uses limited. Making site selection decisions requires finding a balance among use opportunities, trading off development and preservation values, and ensuring predictability and fairness in the decision-making process; the coastal decision model can be a useful tool. This paper characterizes the structure and norms of the coastal decision framework and uses these characterizatioâ€‹ns as criteria for determining the adequacy of the current ocean management regime. A number of `deficiencies' of the current regime are noted that suggest areas for institutional reform."
