14,,"The presence of plasmids in turbot ""Vibrio"" isolates was associated with the bacteria's ability to cause disease in fish. Plasmid-​carrying vibrios could grow under conditions of iron limitation; nonvirulent plasmidless derivatives could not, and were also unable to produce either siderophore activity or the iron-regulated 86 kDal outer membrane protein, suggesting the plasmid-​mediated nature of these components."
