10,Abstract:,"The authors of this paper examined several strategies to reduce seabird bycatch, primarily of common murres (""Uria aalge"") and rhinoceros auklets (""Cerorhinca monocerata""), in a salmon gillnet fishery in Puget Sound, Washington. They compared rates of seabird bycatch in nets modified in collaboration with the fishing industry to include visual or acoustic alerts to traditional nets set throughout the normal fishing hours. The results identify three complementary tools to reduce seabird bycatch in the Puget Sound drift gillnet fishery--gear modifications, abundance- based fishery openings, and time-of-day restrictions-​-​for a possible reduction in seabird bycatch of up to 70-75% without a significant reduction in target fishing efficiency. Although these tools are based on local conditions and will thus vary among years and locations, all might be exportable to other coastal gillnet fisheries worldwide."
