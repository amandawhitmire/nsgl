9,,"The materials included in this compilation concern the decisions that comprise the international law of the sea. Their organization is in terms of the activities that take place in the ocean, such as the movement and anchoring of vessels, the taking of fish, waste dumping, resource exploration and harvesting, the emplacemement of instruments or equipment, the taking of measurements, or simply the observation of nature. The six chapters document important decisions about navigation and flight, nonliving resources, living resources, marine pollution, boundaries, and marine scientific research. Within the chapters, the material is organized around the claims made by states to exercise authority over the activity in question. These claims are often cast in terms of zones and areas in which coastal states claim particular authority. Thus, attention returns to the zonal approach which is so prevalent, but the primary focus of attention is upon the activity that is subject to claimed authority."
