15,Abstract:,"At the Port Townsend Washington State ferry dock, construction is underway. New piles are being sunk dockside. The technique in use: vibrational pile driving. Rapid vertical vibrations are transmitted into the pile - driving it home. This method is often used to try to keep the noise down. Measuring the noise below the surface is a team of graduate students from the UW Department of Mechanical Engineering led by Per Reinhall and Peter Dahl of the UW's Applied Physics Laboratory."
