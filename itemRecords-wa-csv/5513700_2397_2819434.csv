16,Abstract:,"The energetic and nutritional requirements of reproductively maturing fish increase to accommodate the process of gametogenesis. Unquestionably, the endocrine system plays a pivotal role in the metabolic shifts and reproductive performance of maturing fish. There is evidence of the importance or possible roles of metabolic hormones in fish reproduction. Some recent work on the seasonal changes in blood levels of thyroid hormones and insulin in reproductively maturing salmonids is summarized here, and possible roles of these hormones in reproduction are suggested."
