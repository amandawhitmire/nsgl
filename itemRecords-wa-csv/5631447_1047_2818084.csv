15,Abstract:,"The preservative effect of glucose oxidase (GOX) and catalase (CAT) in a 4% glucose aqueous solution were evaluated on shrimp (""Heterocarpus reedi"") stored at 0 deg. - 2 deg. C. On board and immediately after catch, shrimp were washed with tap water at 10 deg. C, and dipped or kept in the enzyme solution. Microbial, chemical, and sensory tests showed that holding shrimp in the GOX/CAT/glucose solution retarded microbial spoilage and preserved quality more effectively than dipping shrimp in the same solution. The importance of treating shrimp as early as possible was demonstrated by comparing shrimp treated 4 and 82 hr after catch."
