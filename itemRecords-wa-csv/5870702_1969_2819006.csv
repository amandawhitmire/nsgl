11,Abstract:,"As part of a collaborative initiative to increase the resiliency of Pacific Northwest harbors to seismic hazards, a GIS assessment model has been created, including 3-D system visualization, hazard scenario simulations, and resource vulnerability analysis. This model is reviewed here, using the harbors of Yaquina Bay, Oregon, as a case study. The model and subsequent analyses facilitate the development of site-specific strategies that protect port and harbor resources and provide a foundation for post- event planning."
