13,Abstract:,The experiments described here were intended to investigate the role of thyroid hormone in reproduction of rainbow trout. In-vivo studies involving injection of gonadotropin-​releasing hormone analogue alone or in combination with thyroid hormone were done to evaluate possible stimulatory effects of the hormones on ovulation and spawning. In-vitro studies were aimed at determining whether the possible action of the hormone was direct. Results suggest that thyroid hormones may influence final maturation of trout by potentiating the steroidogenic responses of the ovary to gonadotropin.
