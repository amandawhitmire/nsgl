12,Abstract:,"The oceans support economically and culturally important fisheries. However, changes in the oceans –such as warming waters, shifts in the distribution, abundance and timing of species, and other alterations to ecosystems– may create risks to coastal communities who are dependent on fisheries. These social-​ecological changes can create vulnerabilities to fishing operations and other “off-the-dock” features of communities participating in fishing-based ways of life. Changes may impact local economies as well as social fabric, fishing identity and access to healthy local seafood, among other social benefits. In this presentation, we present results from recent interview and survey research in West Coast communities. We will discuss local ecological knowledge of ocean changes and the experiences and implications of ecological and socioeconomic change for community well-being. We summarize the kinds of actions that fishing participants, communities, and managers are or could be taking to cope with and adapt to ocean changes."
