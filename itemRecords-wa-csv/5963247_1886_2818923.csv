12,Abstract:,"The response of a high discharge river plume to an alongshore ambient flow and wind forcing is studied with a 3-dimensional numerical model. The study extends prior model studies of plumes by including (1) a very large volume discharge - about twice the maximum used in other models, (2) ambient flow in a direction opposite to that of the propagation of coastally trapped waves, and (3) a sequence of wind direction reversals. The magnitude of the ambient flow, wind stress, estuary width, and river outflow are based on typical values for the Columbia River on the Washington coast. The model results challenge two longstanding notions about the Columbia plume; first, that plume orientation is in a relatively stable southwest position in summer, and, second, that the plume is unidirectional. It appears that branches can occur both upstream and downstream of the river mouth simultaneously."
