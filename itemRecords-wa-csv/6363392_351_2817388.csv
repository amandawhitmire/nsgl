11,Abstract:,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are one management tool used to protect and restore the marine environment. Structured interviews with waterfront users, resource users, key informants and government officials provided insights on the establishment processes of MPAs created by Washington State agencies and local governments. This study examines the establishment process of seven Puget Sound MPAs through an examination of waterfront user demographics, general awareness of the nearby MPA and perceptions of collaboration between the government agency and the nearby community at the different sites. While 44% of waterfront users in Puget Sound were aware of the nearby MPA, males and respondents with at least a college degree were more likely to have heard of the sites. Perceptions varied on the potential environmental impact of MPAs and whether waterfront users thought that their opinion had an impact on the MPA establishment. A dependent variable, 'perceived collaboration,' was built using resource user survey responses to measure the degree of collaboration between state agencies and the nearby community at each site. Two independent variables - a) whether resource users perceived that adequate information was used, and b) whether all views were taken into consideration ? are key factors explaining variance in perceived collaboration. Both were significantly correlated with perceived collaboration with Spearman Rho rank-order correlations of 0.56 and 0.64 respectively (p<0.05). In addition, there was a significant difference between government official and resource user perceptions regarding the openness of the process and the degree of community influence in MPA establishment."
