11,Abstract:,"One of the real difficulties we have in understanding ecosystem properties is our inability to deal with scale. Historical science allows us to approach the issue of scale through the interpretation of pattern in time and space. The historical descriptive approach is applied to research on climate change and biological production in the northeast Pacific; in particular, the rapid decadal-scale shifts in the abundance and distribution of two major components, salmon and zooplankton, of this large marine ecosystem, and how they relate to similar shifts in North Pacific atmosphere and ocean climate. Researchers conclude that they are all related, and that climate-driven regime shifts, such as those identified in the northeast Pacific, can cause major reorganizations of ecological relationships over vast oceanic regions."
