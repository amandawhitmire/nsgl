13,Abstract:,"Reported here is the development of 20 primarily tetranucleotide microsatellite markers from the commercially important gadid fish, walleye pollock ""Theragra chalcogramma,"" isolated using magnetic bead hybridization selection methods. Loci were chosen from an initial pool of 112 microsatellite-â€‹bearing clones for properties such as short array length (and thus minimal expected short allele dominance and PCR induced stutter,) moderate to high levels of variation, and robust amplification. Also the results are reported of tests confirming the Mendelian inheritance of these loci, and their conservation in other gadoid fishes."
