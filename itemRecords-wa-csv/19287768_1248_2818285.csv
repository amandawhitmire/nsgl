6,Abstract:,"The Blue Crab Bowl is Virginia’s regional competition of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl (NOSB®), an academic tournament for high school students. Designed to inspire and challenge high school students, the Blue Crab Bowl tests the competitors’ knowledge of the marine sciences, covering the breadth of oceanography and maritime disciplines. In February or March of each year, up to 16 teams from Virginia high schools compete in a contest co-hosted by the Old Dominion University and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. At the Bowl, each match pits two teams of four students in an academic quiz‐bowl format. The Bowl offers students who excel in math and science a chance to receive regional and national recognition for their diligence and talent. The 19th Annual Blue Crab Bowl was held February 5-6, 2016, at the Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. The Regional Coordinators are pleased to announce a successful competition involving 16 teams. After a hard fought competition and only one loss after more than 45 matches, students from Chesapeake Bay Governor’s School, Warsaw Campus Team A took a close Second Place in the Blue Crab Bowl. This 19th Annual Virginia Regional competition of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl was held at Old Dominion University’s Norfolk Campus on February 6. Coached by science teacher Bethany Smith, the team consisted of all seniors including: Stephen Parker (Northumberland High School); Lizzie Ellis (Essex High); Michael Johnson (Washington & Lee High); Team Captain John Richardson (Lancaster High School), and Hannah Gross (Essex High). Winner participated in the National Competition in Morehead City, North Carolina April 21-24, 2016."
