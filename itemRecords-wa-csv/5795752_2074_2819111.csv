9,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to determine how ""Renibacterium salmoninarum"" (Rs) injection and subsequent Rs infection affected long- term growth, percent survival, and mean number of days to death for subadult chinook salmon. The author examines the effects of varying Rs infection levels on fish size, growth rates, and disease resistance over a 600-day period. General trends are reported."
