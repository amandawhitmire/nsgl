9,Abstract:,"The Communications Manager of Washington Sea Grant describes the protocols and courtesies that should govern interactions between the author of a highly technical report and the editor or communicator that addresses the technical information for a wider readership. These include mutual professional respect, willingness to negotiate, avoidance of nitpicking, (but) care for detail to the very end, and gracious distribution of credit."
