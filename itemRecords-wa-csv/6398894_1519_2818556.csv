9,Abstract:,"Since its inception in 2003, NOAA Science Camp has evolved into a highly regarded collaborative science program. It introduces middle-school aged youth to the multidisciplinaâ€‹ry nature of research. Scientists and educators interact directly with camp participants to demonstrate how NOAA research addresses environmental issues on both local and international scales. NOAA Science Camp is a self-motivated, cumulative learning experience that is at the core of real-world science learning. Camp activities integrate NOAA sciences into high-quality educational materials through a curriculum that meets state education standards, as well as all Ocean Literacy Essential Principles. Complex concepts are presented in innovative and interesting ways that engage campers and demonstrate that science can be fun. Science activities are blended with other enriching camp experiences - playing field games, gaining confidence through team-building and fostering new friendships with fellow campers."
