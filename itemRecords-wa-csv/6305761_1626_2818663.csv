13,Abstract:,"Recent studies have shown that pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are ubiquitous in the environment. These PPCPs are continuously discharged in wastewater effluent suggesting that conventional water treatment methods are not consistently effective at removing these emerging organic contaminants. In this study, the sonochemical degradation of two representative PPCPs, ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin, were investigated in the presence of a natural organic matter (NOM), Suwannee river fulvic acid (FA). The pseudo first-order degradation rate constants, k (s-1), were determined at a frequency of 620 kHz, power density of 400 W/L, and different PPCP and FA initial concentrations. The results indicated that the presence of FA had little effect on the degradation rate constant of PPCPs."
