11,Abstract:,"Survival rates for coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") were estimated for all coded wire tag release groups in the Pacific Northwest between 1971 and 1990. The spatial and temporal patterns show considerable geographic variation, with most regions south of northern British Columbia showing declining survival since 1983, while northern areas have shown increasing survival during that period. Survival of marked wild fish generally showed the same trend as hatchery fish. The authors conclude that the ocean conditions have been the dominant factor affecting coho salmon survival since the 1970's, and that a major reduction in exploitation rates is necessary to maintain the populations."
