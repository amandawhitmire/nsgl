9,Abstract:,"A cytological study of the heteromorphic marine red alga ""Porphyra torta"" was conducted to determine where meiosis occurs in the life history. Chromosome counts in all developmental stages of the conchocelis phase, including the maturing conchospores up to the time of release, were diploid. In contrast, all chromosome counts in two- and three-celled sporelings were haploid. Characteristics of the first division of the conchospore and the change in ploidy at the two-celled stage indicate that meiosis I occurs during the germination division of the conchospores of this alga."
