10,Abstract:,"There are severe restrictions on the importation and distribution of grass carp ""Ctenopharyngodâ€‹on idella"" in the U.S. Of primary concern is the potential naturalization of grass carp to the detriment of indigenous fauna and flora. Because of the grass carp's prodigious weed-eating capabilities and its potential value for control of aquatic vegetation, efforts have been made to create nonreproducing populations of grass carp. Triploid grass crap became available commercially in 1983; it has been presumed that triploids are sterile. Gonad development is retarded in triploid grass carp--females are functionally sterile, whereas males have large testes with numerous spermatids. This study examined the products of male meiosis and estimated their potential contribution to future generations."
