13,Abstract:,"This essay takes a broad look at the appalling rates of bycatch in fisheries around the world, the technical and political influences, and the necessity of compromise on all sides of the issue in order to reduce the problem. The authors discuss an example where efforts to decrease the rate of bycatch of one species led to increased rates for others"
