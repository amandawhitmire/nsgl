13,Abstract:,"Aquaculture is viewed as a potential mechanism to meet the growing demand for seafood around the world. The future of bivalve shellfish aquaculture in the U.S. hinges on sustainable practices on the part of industry and a more consistent regulatory regime. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture is a recent practice relative to its history in other countries, beginning in the late 1800s along the U.S. West Coast where it is now well established with farm raised product utilizing land-based hatcheries and grow-out directly in numerous estuaries. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture can be viewed as a disturbance which modifies the estuarine system in three ways: 1) changes in material processes ? bivalves process food and produce wastes; 2) addition of physical structure ? aquaculture introduces the cultured organisms and in some cases a physical anchoring structure; and 3) pulse disturbances like harvest and bed maintenance disturb sediments, remove species in addition to the cultured organisms themselves, and change resource or habitat availability. In U.S.West Coast estuaries, water column and sediment nutrient concentrations are relatively high and influenced by large tidal exchange and proximity to deeper nearshore ocean waters where upwelling controls production during summer months. Bivalves are unlikely to influence material processes except at local bed scales in these systems, although estuary-wide effects could appear as the fraction of cultured area rises or in poorly flushed bays. Bivalve culture clearly modifies estuarine habitat at local community and at landscape scales and effects are most often evaluated against existing structured habitat in the form of submerged aquatic vegetation. Individual activities act as pulse disturbances and the recovery of eelgrass (Zostera marina) to predisturbance levels is variable (b2 to N5 years). The extent of disturbance depends on the aquaculture practice and the distribution of eelgrass reflects a balance of space competition, pulse disturbance and recovery, and is therefore at dynamic equilibrium on aquaculture beds. Structure provided by aquaculture appears functionally similar to eelgrass for small benthic infauna and mobile epibenthic fauna while use of aquaculture as habitat by larger more mobile invertebrates and fish depends on mobility and varies with lifehistory stage and taxon being evaluated. Scale seems a very important management consideration and further research at estuarine landscape scales, especially for habitat use by important invertebrates and fish, may prove useful in designing and implementing best management practices. Though local and short term effects from aquaculture are clearly evident in U.S.West Coast estuaries, bivalve aquaculture does not remove area from the estuary or degrade water quality like other anthropogenic influences, and thus has not been implicated in shifts to alternate states or reduced adaptive capacity of the larger ecological system."
