12,Abstract:,"In the Grays Harbor estuary, juvenile Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"" Dana) are found at higher densities in epibenthic shell deposits compared to open mud flat. Differences in predation rate between habitats have been suggested to be due to habitat preference and differential survival. Reported here is the first experimental study of swimming behavior of Dungeness crab megalopae in a range of current velocities (0-40 cm s-1) equivalent to natural flow in Grays Harbor estuary. The results suggest that Dungeness crab megalopae are able to maneuver and actively search for settlement sites under current velocities found in natural habitats, including intertidal shell deposits, and support the hypothesis of active selection of shell by megalopae."
