10,Abstract:,"The Columbia River was once the greatest salmon-​producing area on the entire Pacific Coast. During that era, 10-16 million salmon and steelhead made their home in the Columbia River and its tributaries. In more recent years, however, the annual runs have been only 2.5 million. The decline of the Columbia River salmon is the culmination of events and activities that have occurred over the past hundred years. This brochure highlights the rich salmon resource that was present for thousands of years; presents reasons for the decline over the past century; and outlines current salmon protection and enhancement efforts that are underway."
