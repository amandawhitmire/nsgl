10,Abstract:,"Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoy technology, developed at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Lab (PMEL) in Seattle, Washington, is based on the integration of real-time measurements and modeling technologies. This system improves the capability for the early detection and real-time reporting of tsunamis in the open ocean."
