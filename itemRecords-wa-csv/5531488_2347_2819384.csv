12,Abstract:,"The transitions between life-history stages provide many unique opportunities for studying basic endocrine phenomena. The hormonal control of ontogeny in fish and amphibians is reviewed here. Neuroendocrine regulation and actions of metabolic and osmoregulatory hormones (thyroid, interrenal, pituitary, pancreas, and gut) during amphibian and fish metamorphosis and the parr-smolt transformation of juvenile salmon are discussed, along with the developmental significance of hormones in egg yolk."
