13,Abstract:,"This paper focuses on the relatively recent introduction of the marine European green crab ""Carcinus maenas"" into the northeastern Pacific, and review how the species has colonized its new environment, how it is dispersing from its location of introduction, what perceived biological consequences have been detected to date, and what biological consequences might be expected if its range extends into the island waters of British Columbia and Washington State."
