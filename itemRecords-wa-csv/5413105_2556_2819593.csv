9,Abstract:,"Serious consideration is currently being given to the feasibility of applying surimi-â€‹processing technology in order to utilize menhaden (""Brevoortia tyrannus"") for human food consumption. The menhaden industry infrastructure in the Chesapeake Bay and mid-Atlantic region is well developed for the production primarily during the late spring, summer, and fall months. Additional supplies of raw material must be secured during the winter months to keep a menhaden-based surimi plant operating at peak efficiency and to maximize returns on fixed assets. A complementary species would have to meet several exacting requirements to be considered as a possible alternative source of raw material. The spiny dogfish ""Squalus acanthias"") is an alternative species which meets many, if not all, of these requirements."
