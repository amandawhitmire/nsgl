9,Abstract:,The long-term strategy of the RIDGE initiative is to achieve sufficient spatial and temporal definition of the global mid-ocean ridge-crust system to allow development and extensive testing of numerical models that link all major aspects of energy flow through the planatary spreading center network. This document contains the reports of five 1989 RIDGE Working Groups. The draft program outline is followed by reports on global structure and fluxes; crustal accretion variables; experimental approaches to mantle flow and melt generation; observing temporal variability of ridge-crust processes; and event detection and response.
