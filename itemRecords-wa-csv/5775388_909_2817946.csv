12,Abstract:,"Examination of historical records for coho salmon in Big Beef Creek (Washington), indicated that more adult males than females returned to spawn, and that the mean length of the females exceeded that of males. A sex-linked pseudogene was used to determine the sex of smolts emigrating from Big Beef Creek in 1995-1997. In each year the sex ratio was indistinguishabâ€‹le from 50:50, indicating similar survival rates in fresh water, and implying that the male and female follow different foraging strategies at sea. The female strategy results in greater mortality, but benefits survivors with greater size. The male strategy allows greater survival at the cost of reduced size."
