15,Abstract:,"This report provides a summary and compendium of the management of estuaries in the Pacific Northwest that lie between Puget Sound, Washington and Cape Mendocino, California. It begins with a timeline of the historical progress of estuary management for each of the three states. Then, following a comprehensive description of each estuary reviewed in this study, it gives an overview of federal, state and local management programs as well as significant special programs involved. Details of particular programs and approaches are described, as are issues that frequently arise. The intent of this publication is to help managers learn more about the variety of strategies being pursued."
