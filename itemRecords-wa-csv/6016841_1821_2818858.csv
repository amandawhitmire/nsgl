14,Abstract:,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe to the male-specific GH-Y (growth hormone pseudogene) was used to identify the Y chromosome in coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch""). The sex chromosome pair is morphologically similar to chinook salmon (""Oncorhynchus tshawytscha"") with the GH-Y localized to the small short arm of the largest subtelocentric chromosome pair. FISH experiments with probes containing sex-linked genes in rainbow trout (""Oncorhynchus mykiss"") (SCAR163) and chinook salmon (Omy7INRA) showed that the coho sex linkage group is different from chinook and rainbow trout and this was confirmed by segregation analysis for the Omy7INRA locus. The telomeric location of the SEX locus, the presence of shared male-specific markers in coho and chinook salmon, and the lack of conservation of sex-linkage groups suggest that transposition of a small male-specific region may have occurred repeatedly in salmonid fishes of the genus ""Oncorhynchus""."
