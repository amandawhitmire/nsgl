10,Abstract:,"Salmon are the sould of the Pacific Northwest. People tend to think of the Northwest as a place of natural abundance_of forests, rivers, and fish. Unfortunately, the salmon decline is real. Recognizing the seriousness of the problem, many hard-working coastal people are involved trying to restore salmon and the watersheds they share with the fish. Salmon and watersheds interact in unique and subtle ways. Profile are watershed restoration projects in coastal Oregon, Washington, and California. This half-hour video is suitable for middle school through adult audiencies."
