21,Abstract:,"Phenylpropanoid​s and flavonoids are major classes of natural products commonly associated with plants. These secondary metabolites are structurally diverse, serve important physiological functions in plants, and exhibit numerous pharmacological properties. The absence of phenylpropanoid​s and flavonoids in bacteria apparently mirrows the absence of two key enzymes, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and chalcone synthase. This article highlights progress on the biochemical and genetic characterizatio​n of recently identified bacterial enzymes and pathways with ties to the plant world."
