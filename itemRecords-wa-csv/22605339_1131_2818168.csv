17,Abstract:,"Genomic approaches permit direct estimation of inbreeding and its effect on fitness.We used genomic-based estimates of inbreeding to investigate their relationship witheight adult traits in a captive-reared Pacific salmonid that is released into the wild.Estimates were also used to determine whether alternative broodstock managementappro​aches reduced risks of inbreeding. Specifically, 1,100 unlinked restriction-​siteassociated (RAD) loci were used to compare pairwise relatedness, derived from arelationship matrix, and individual inbreeding, estimated by comparing observed andexpected homozygosity, across four generations in two hatchery lines of Chinooksalmon that were derived from the same source. The lines are managed as “integrated”wit​h the founding wild stock, with ongoing gene flow, and as “segregated”wit​h no gene flow. While relatedness and inbreeding increased in the first generationof both lines, possibly due to population subdivision caused by hatchery initiation,the integrated line had significantly lower levels in some subsequent generations (relatedness:F2​–F4; inbreeding F2). Generally, inbreeding was similar between the linesdespite large differences in effective numbers of breeders. Inbreeding did not affectfecundity​, reproductive effort, return timing, fork length, weight, condition factor,and daily growth coefficient. However, it delayed spawn timing by 1.75 days per onestandard deviation increase in F (~0.16). The results indicate that integrated managementmay reduce inbreeding but also suggest that it is relatively low in a small,segregate​d hatchery population that maximized number of breeders. Our findingsdemonst​rate the utility of genomics to monitor inbreeding under alternative managementstrat​egies in captive breeding programs."
