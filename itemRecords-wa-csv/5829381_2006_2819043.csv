9,Abstract:,"The role of port authorities is changing. Policy decisions are no longer a matter of 'winging it,' but instead must be informal and deliberative. The reasons are that competition among ports has increased and the public is less inclined to provide subsidies. On the contrary, some cities now demand a share of net revenues for themselves. The future will see more active boards of directors, and a more team- like approach in sharing decision making with executive managers, who in the past were used to more autonomy."
