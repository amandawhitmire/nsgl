11,Abstract:,"Previous studies suggest that collaboration between management agencies and the public has the potential to increase the legitimacy of Marine Protected Area establishment processes, thereby leading to increased public support. A social survey was conducted in seven communities near Puget Sound MPAs to determine whether government agency-public collaboration can be empirically connected to increased process legitimacy and public support. Results show that perceptions of collaboration are significantly correlated with measures of process legitimacy and public support, while tangible measures of collaboration (meeting attendance, information sharing, opinion solicitation) are not significantly correlated. Perceived collaboration is shown to account for 38.9% of the variance in process legitimacy and 13.8% of the variance in public support. Process legitimacy is shown to mediate the relationship between perceived collaboration and public support. Exploratory analysis identifies variables that may account for additional variance in process legitimacy and public support, beyond that already explained by perceived collaboration."
