11,Abstract:,"Chitosan is naturally produced by many fungi. This study shows it is clearly a signalling component within some host- parasite interactions, with a potential both for direct and antifungal action against the pathogen and the activation of host genes which are associated with the major resistance reactions of the host plant. The renewed interest in chitosan as an agricultural chemical may result in uncovering other direct beneficial actions of chitosan on existing crop plants which can be exploited for the benefit of food production."
