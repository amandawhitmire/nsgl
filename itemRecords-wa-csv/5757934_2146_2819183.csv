11,Abstract:,"Since some fungal nucleases can be released into the extracellular environment, the knowledge of their functional role is important for understanding the growth, development and survival of the fungus. Initial research indicated that a highly catalytic nuclease was released into the culture filtrate of shake cultures of ""Colletotrichum cooccodes"" (CCN). Here the authors report the purification and characterizatioâ€‹n of one ""C. coccodes"" extracellular nuclease and discuss the probability of its functional role in plant pathogen interactions."
