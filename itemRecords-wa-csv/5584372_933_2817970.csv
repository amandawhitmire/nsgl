14,Abstract:,"This paper presents an equivalent adult loss model of impacts to the Washington coast Dungeness crab fishery from dredging of a navigation channel in Grays Harbor, Washington. The model is driven by empirical population data to account for spatial and temporal variation in abundance and age-class structure. Results show that impacts are quite sensitive to the type of dredge used and the season in which dredging occurs. Contrary to initial expectations, the 0+ age-group loss was unimportant relative to losses from older age-classes. Despite many limitations, the model has proven useful for focusing impact assessment work, as a basis for scheduling construction to reduce impacts, and as a basis for scaling mitigation projects."
