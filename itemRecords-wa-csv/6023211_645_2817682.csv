9,Abstract:,"Washington State is the leading producer of farmed bivalve shellfish in the United States and Puget Sound (PS) is one of the richest shellfish growing areas in Washington. Washington State currently uses fecal coliform concentration in growing water to determine the safety of consuming shellfish harvested from Puget Sound (PS). With the exception of some Vibrio testing, the level of viral or bacterial contamination in PS shellfish has never been studied. The reason for this is that current methods for testing shellfish tissues for viral and bacterial contamination are considered cumbersome and inefficient, a result of the tedious dissection and extraction procedures required for isolating the viruses from the digestive tissue of oysters, and the lack of a standardized protocol (including primer/probe sets) for Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR. In this study, two modifications were made to current methods to overcome the problems of labor intensive isolation procedures and the need for a high- speed centrifuge. The first was ultra-cold freezing of oyster tissue prior to dissection, and the second was direct RNA isolation from oyster lysate. Since shellfish tissue may contain high levels of PCR inhibitors, and because viruses and other pathogens collect in the digestive diverticulum (DD) of shellfish, recently described methods have relied on isolation of the digestive tissues prior to viral analysis in effort to reduce inhibition. Pre-freezing the intact oyster resulted in separation of the adductor muscles from the shell and made it significantly easier to remove oysters from their shells. More importantly, freezing allowed for easier location and dissection of the DD within the organism. Isolating RNA directly from the oyster lysate rather than relying on an adsorption/elut​ion technique increases the sensitivity of the assay. Chloroform extraction removed the majority of particulate matter from the oyster lysate, making near-constant reloading of the Qiagen RNeasy columns possible. Because the amount of virus in shellfish tissue is commonly small, being able to sample a larger volume is critical in order to capture the small amount of virus which may be present. To ensure wide breadth of detection, two sets of broadly reactive primers and Taqman probes were used in the real time RT-PCR assay to detect the viral RNA captured on the Qiagen columns. These modifications resulted in a method for detection of virus in oyster tissue that significantly reduced both personnel time required to complete the assay and time to detection of virus in the samples."
