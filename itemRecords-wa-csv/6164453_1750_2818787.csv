10,Abstract:,"Florida pompano (Trachinotus caro!inus), a marine carnivore, is one of the most expensive food fish in the United States and is gaining commercial aquaculture importance. Currently, fishmeal is being replaced in fish diets with less expensive plant proteins such as soybean meal and its derivatives to reduce the feed cost and subsequent production cost. A 12-wk feeding trial was conducted to determine the effect of different levels of soybean meal (SM) and soy protein concentrate (SC) on the growth performance of juvenile Florida pompano. A control diet was formulated with dehulled solvent-â€‹extracted soybean meal, low-antigen soy protein concentrate, wheat flour, corn gluten meal, and fishmea1, to contain 45% crude protein and 12% crude fat. Another five experimental diets (SC36/SM35, SC39/SM30, SC42/SM25, SC46/SM20, and SC58/SMO) were formulated with the same ingredients except fishmea1 to match the control diet's protein and fat content. Fifteen pompano juveniles (mean body weight of 3.7 g) were stocked in each of24, 189-L rectangular tanks in two recirculation systems maintained at about 16 ppt salinity. Each of the six diets was randomly assigned to two tanks in each system. The fish were fed to apparent satiation everyday for 12 weeks and weighed at the end of 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. There was no difference in the growth performance among fish fed the non-fishmeal diets and for each weighing period, all fish fed non-fishmeal diets had significantly (P < 0.05) lower weight gain and specific growth rate than fish fed the control diet. To determine if the nonfishmeal diets had any palatability issue and consequent lower growth rate, another feeding trial was conducted with selected experimental diets from the first trial which were reformulated to contain some fishmeal. The data from both the feeding trials will be presented and discussed."
