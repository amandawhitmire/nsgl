11,Abstract:,"What can you do about ocean acidification? More than you think. While it's true that ocean acidification is a global problem caused primarily by industrialized nations' use of fossil fuels, it is particularly severe in our region. Because local problems, like nutrient pollution, urban runoff, and dense traffic are exacerbating ocean acidification in Puget Sound, these issues are something Washington residents can address."
