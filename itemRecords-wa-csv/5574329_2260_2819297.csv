11,Abstract:,"The industrial process for extracting chitosan from low cost shellfish waste is well known. It comprises three basic steps: deproteinizatio​n, demineralizatio​n of the shells to yield chitin, followed by deacetylation of chitin to produce chitosan. However, the product obtained from the process often still contains many impurities. The treatment of chitosan flakes with aqueous solutions of inorganic polybasic acids permits the removal of impurities. This paper describes an engineering-​type procedure which develops a pure, colorless material having a controlled molecular weight."
