10,Abstract:,"Recreational boaters and others who use and enjoy our marine waters are faced today with a very serious problem--waste disposal. Most people are aware of waste disposal problems on land, but not everyone knows that there is also a growing crisis at sea. More than 14 ""billion"" pounds of crew wastes, gear, and cargo are lost or dumped into the oceans every year from vessels involved in recreational boating, commercial fishing, merchant shipping, passenger service, and other marine-related activities. Because the problem has reached such enormous proportions, laws have been enacted to prohibit the disposal of plastics, boat garbage, oil, hazardous materials, and sewage into marine waters. This publication focuses on the issue of wastes in the marine environment-​-​where they come from, what damage they cause, and how the problem can be reduced."
