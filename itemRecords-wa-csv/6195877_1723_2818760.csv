9,Abstract:,"Past reports of fish kill events in Hood Canal, a fjord like sub-basin of Puget Sound, have attracted legislative and community interest in the vulnerabilities of this ecosystem. Here I seek to explore the impacts of prolonged and intensified seasonal hypoxia on the structure of resident food webs to evaluate ecological responses to hypoxia in Hood Canal and explore the application of ecosystem-based management (EBM) tactics for mitigating the problem of hypoxia in the region. I use a quantitative modeling approach to construct mass-balanced food web models, enabling the exploration of system -- level metrics that cannot be identified with a species or community-level approach. Specifically, I developed four mass-balanced food web (Ecopath) models to evaluate differences in food web structures between a site that experiences regular seasonal hypoxia and one that does not. I also compared seasonal shifts via analysis of food web structures prior to the onset of regular seasonal hypoxia and during seasonal hypoxia. The food web structures at Hoodsport, which regularly experiences seasonal hypoxia, were characterized by reduced biomass, production, and absolute flow at all trophic levels compared with the food web structures at Hazel Point, which does not regularly experience seasonal hypoxia. These differences were magnified with the onset of seasonal hypoxia. Differences between time periods at Hoodsport reflects the hypoxia, seasonal, and other unidentified impacts, whereas the differences at Hazel Point reflect seasonal and unidentified impacts absent of hypoxia. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is an integrated approach that considers entire ecosystems, including humans, the interactions among ecosystem components, and the cumulative impacts of multiple activities (McLeod et al. 2005, Leslie & McLeod 2007, Levin & Lubchenco 2008). EBM can be applied to the management of stressed or disturbed marine ecosystems. Here I used the stressed ecosystem of Hood Canal as an example of the application of the four principles for marine EBM at the regional scale. I demonstrated the four key principles of EBM (Leslie & McLeod 2007) at work to address the hypoxia problem in Hood Canal. I identified the way in which each principle is currently addressed. I summarized exemplary actions of the Hood Canal Dissolved Oxygen Program (HCDOP) and its partners relating to each principle. Finally, I argue that the EBM approach used to address hypoxia in Hood Canal can be used as a model for managing other marine ecosystems under stress."
