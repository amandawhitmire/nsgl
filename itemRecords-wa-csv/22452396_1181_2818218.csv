17,Abstract:,"Consumers and regulators influence conservation of marine finfish by controllingharv​est demand and availability. Consumer power to choose sustainablyharv​estedspecies is threatened by seafood mislabeling, which may be a productof fraud or human error. Here we examined the prevalence of mislabeling,and its financial and ecological implications, by compiling and analyzing aninternational dataset of DNA barcoding studies of marine finfish (n = 43). Onaverage, DNA-identified species sold were less expensive (−2.98% ex-vesselprice) and more sustainable (+3.88% IUCN status) than species listed on theirlabel; thus, mislabeling had a net positive impact on the conservation statusof sold species. However, ecological impacts of some frequently mislabeledtaxa were potentially severe, suggesting eco-conscious consumers may wantto avoid certain genera. Mislabeling may be reduced by increasing traceabilityand identification of seafoods, particularly at points in the chain-​of-​custodybeyond ports, where the majority of mislabeling occurred."
