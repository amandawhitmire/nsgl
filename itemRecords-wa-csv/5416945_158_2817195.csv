10,Abstract:,"Congress established the National Sea Grant College Program in 1966 to accelerate the development, use, and conservation of the nation's marine resources. Ather 15 years of modest federal support, Sea Grant's quiet life was suddenly disrupted in 1981 when the Reagan administration decided--in budget parlance--to `zero out' the program. For the last five years the President's budget has sought to eliminate its funds. Each time Congress has restored them. The durability of this tiny program is an interesting case of `distributive' or `clientele' politics. As Daniel Webster said of Dartmouth College, it is small, but there are those who love it. Policies get made in many ways. The Sea Grant program has developed a particular kind of political network. It is not like all Washington networks. It is also not unique. It belongs to a class of policies. To show this it is necessary to give it a proper conceptual and theoretical setting. We can anticipate the political process likely to surround different kinds of policies by linking what a policy is supposed to do (regulate, distribute, redistribute) with an identification of those affected by it."
