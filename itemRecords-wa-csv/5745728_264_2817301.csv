14,Abstract:,"This study compared entanglement rates of seabirds and marine mammals and catch rates of salmon among three experimental gear treatments and a control (nylon and monofilament netting), and among three time-of-day categories. Because the scope of activities and seabird interactions were greater in the sockeye fishery than in the chum fishery, research in the sockeye fishery is emphasized. The goal was to develop methods that eliminate or significantly reduce the incidental capture of seabirds in salmon gillnet fisheries without significantly reducing the fishing efficiency of the nets. Three basic tools to reduce seabird bycatch are identified: abundance-based management, alternative gear, and time-of-day."
