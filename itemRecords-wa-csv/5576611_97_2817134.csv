11,Abstract:,"Twenty years ago, Washington state's oyster industry suffered from uncertain seed oyster supplies, the Manila clam fishery was in its infancy, and mussel aquaculture was just a hopeful idea. Today, however, Washington is one of the few states blessed by diverse arid thriving commercial and recreational shellfisheries. It leads the nation in commercial production of Manila clams, its oyster crop is surpassed only by that of Louisiana, and cultured Puget Sound mussels are the rage in West Coast restaurants. Subject areas in this publication include: shellfish, resource management, human health, shellfish culture, water quality education. Available publications and a bibliography are also included."
