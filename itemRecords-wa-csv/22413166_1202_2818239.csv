13,Abstract:,"Modular  adaptive design facilitates the inclusion of changing demands through entire lifecycle of the ship. Almost the only certainty in the design of  a Navy ship is that the final use will not be the exact operational scenario that was envisioned during the design of the ship; therefore, the ship must be designed to be adaptable to new missions and new technologies. Ensuring that the ship remains fully functional for unforeseen tasking and is easily upgraded with new, currently unknown technologies is one path to a long service life for a platform. Over many years, the trend has been toward more power-intensive weapons and sensor systems, with the result that the engine and power distribution system are an integral part of the performance of the ship payload items. We propose that a modular integrated power corridor is just the modular, flexible structure needed for the electrical distribution system."
