11,Abstract:,"Seabird mortality in fisheries is recognized as a global marine conservation issue. Seabirds are attracted to fishing vessels due to the discharge of whole fish and offal. Once in the vicinity of a trawl vessel, seabird mortality can occur due to collisions with cables or net monitoring devices. One objective of this report was to provide NMFS with estimates of warp and third-wire effort by target fishery, large geographic region and vessel types for Alaska trawl fisheries to fulfill their required reporting to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A second objective was to provide information that will guide future investigations of the extent and significance of seabird cable strikes in the Alaska fisheries and inform the development of mitigation technologies and practices, should they be necessary."
