10,Abstract:,"This is the final report of a Sea Grant project to demonstrate the feasibility of raising marketable pan-size salmon on a commercial scale in Puget Sound, Washington. A total of 211,000 salmon were successfully raised from eggs to an average marketable 12-inch size (approximately 340 grams) in fourteen months using floating net pens. The following phases of the operation are described in this report: 1. Incubation of eggs. 2. Freshwater cultivation in ponds. 3. Saltwater cultivation in net pens. 4. Stimulation of public awareness. 5. Environmental monitoring. Th​e overall objective of the program was to stimulate aquaculture development by demonstrating the feasibility of commercial-​scale production of pan-size salmon. Other topics/key words include: fingerling salmon, freshwater ponds, harvesting and test marketing."
