8,Abstract:,"Over the past fifteen years, state government has spent much of its time seeking to wrest power away from federal agencies by gaining a greater voice in federal decision-​making. The prevalent issue used by the state has been the environmental and economic impact that will result in state and local populations and resources due to federal decision-​making. Issues should shift away from impact identification and toward use alternatives; states should become full and equal participants in the fashioning of ocean uses, even in areas far seaward of their borders, and the state's role must be enhanced to make the partnership a reality. Elements of state-level ocean initiatives, and governmental mechanisms through which the initiatives may be launched, are suggested."
