13,,"Salmonid feeding in Puget Sound has been a topic of interest since the mid-1970s, although most studies have been short-duration and spatially-â€‹limited. Prey preferences appear to differ by habitat, time, and size within each species. It is therefore difficult to pinpoint the most critical prey source for a species, as the dominant source typically shifts over time, size range, habitat, and often between years. We reviewed the available literature on salmon feeding habits in Puget Sound and summarized patterns in feeding by species by habitat. We also identified data gaps for additional study. Each species generally progresses from a typical nearshore diet characterized largely by epibenthic crustaceans to a typical offshore diet comprised of pelagic zooplankton. Chinook salmon feed on epibenthic gammarid amphipods and neustonic drift insects then transition to a diet based on pelagic crustacean larvae and small fish prey. Coho salmon also display a progression from epibenthic to pelagic feeding, but may depend on epibenthic prey sources to a lesser extent than other species. Chum salmon have stronger dependence on the epibenthos than the other species: they rely on gammarid amphipods and harpacticoid copepods heavily at small sizes nearshore and appear to be highly selective and size-selective for these prey. In offshore pelagic areas, chum salmon tend to feed on larvaceans and calanoid copepods. Pink salmon diets are similar to that of chum salmon, feeding epibenthically on harpacticoids and gammarids then moving offshore to feed on calanoid copepods and larvaceans. Of the species, data are most lacking for pink salmon. For all species, the pelagic feeding stage is the least well-studied. Additionally, many previous studies focused on only a relatively small near-to-shore area, which makes large-scale basin comparisons challenging. Data which integrate over habitats and capture zooplankton availability and feeding transitions are needed to fully evaluate juvenile salmonids' estuarine and early marine prey experience."
