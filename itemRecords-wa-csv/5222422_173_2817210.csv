11,Abstract:,"During the fishing season in Bristol Bay in 1971 a feasibility study was made with a field terminal connected to a remote processor in a cooperative venture among Alaska Department of Fish and Game, National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Fisheries Research Institute of the University of Washington. The purpose of this paper is to outline a framework for future studies of management problems and strategies, to discuss briefly experiences gained in the use of computer access during the fishing season in Bristol Bay in the summer of 1971, and to describe in detail the construction of a data base for the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery."
