13,Abstract:,"Traditionally, natural resource management has focused almost exclusively on the natural environment, or biophysical condition of the ecosystem. Natural science conceptualizati​ons and investigations were separated from those of the social sciences, as the two scientific fields developed independently and do not combine easily (Ostrom et al. 2009). The wellbeing of human communities is inextricably linked to both the health of the earth’s biophysical environment and the health of humans living in the community (Yee et al. 2012); however, our understanding of how humans interact and benefit from nature has been limited. Although many have studied the human-nature interaction, the complexity of coupled systems has not been well understood (Liu et al. 2007)."
