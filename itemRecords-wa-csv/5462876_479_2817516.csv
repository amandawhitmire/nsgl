10,Abstract:,"The `conventional wisdom' about petroleum resources off the Washington coast is challenged in this book. Written by two geologists in the state's Department of Natural Resources, it unveils a new analysis of Washington coastal geology with significant implications for planned 1992 federal sale of petroleum leases on the outer continental shelf (OCS). The authors argue that the potential for large discoveries is better than previously thought, that oil rather than gas would most likely be developed, and that the entire length of the OCS has oil potential (with the greatest potential within about 12 miles of the shore). The public domain data available were not of sufficient quantity or quality for estimating the total reserves; using these results, however, industry and government can evaluate their own more extensive data to clarify the hydrocarbon potential of the Washington OCS. This book is a technical reference document for petroleum geologists, and includes twelve separate working-size maps and seismic charts."
