10,Abstract:,"The estuarine systems of the central Gulf of Mexico are among the most biologically prolific areas in the world, but competition for waterways and wetlands has often led to habitat destruction and pollution. A technique was deveoped for the Mississippi Sound whereby all scientific data could be assimilated in a format that permits sediment pollution to be assessed and possible solutions to be evaluated. The areas of investigation were: pollutant levels, toxicity of pollutant-laden sediments, resuspension properties of sediments, sediment disturbance potential and resilience of biological communities. After division of the sound into geographic segments, each was assigned a rating in each of the five categories with a combined rating called an environmental stress index. Only a few `hot spots' emerged from the study. What was surprising was the low ratings in certain industrialized regions that are subjected to routine dredging. The indexing system can be readily adapted to any estuarine system and can be updated as conditions in the estuary change or broaden for more detailed surveys."
