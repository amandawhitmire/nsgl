13,Abstract:,"Effective strategic communication is essential to resolving conflicts, building partnerships and creating public support for science-based management of coastal resources. The session from which this report issues examined the purpose, structure and effectiveness of a Sea Grant forum on national fisheries issues held September 11, 1995, at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., that resulted from a collaborative, multi-â€‹institutional effort organized by the session's speakers. The session also examined the most appropriate strategies and tools for effectively communicating complex coastal issues to the media and for infusing scientific information into coastal policy-making."
