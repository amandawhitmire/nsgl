11,Abstract:,"This instructional videotape accurately conveys the technique for creating triploid Pacific oysters with the chemical ""cytochalasin B."" It is approximately 37 minutes long and is co-produced by the School of Fisheries, Washington Sea Grant, and Instructional Media Services at the University of Washington. Shot in the laboratory and on the shores of Puget Sound, it visually follows steps in the manual (see WASHU-H-89-001 and WASHU-​A-​89-​001), including an explanation of the significance of the technique and a simple depiction of how ""cytochalasin B"" acts on a subcellular level. As a package, the manual and video are suitable for oyster hatchery operators and for undergraduate and graduate students in fisheries, biology, zoology, and genetics. The manual also can be purchased separately from the University of Washington Press."
