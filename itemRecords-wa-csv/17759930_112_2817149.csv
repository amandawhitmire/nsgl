14,Abstract:,"A marina manager or harbormaster’s job is not easy. On any given day, you wear the hat of a property manager, hotel concierge, marketing executive, maintenance supervisor, dispute mediator, and environmental compliance officer. Your already dynamic world is made increasingly complicated by trying to stay current and in compliance with state, federal, and local laws and regulations. This handbook is intended to help you to better understand what you need to do to operate a clean and safe marina. It is written and published by the agencies and organizations charged with protecting Washington’s waters and aquatic resources, as well as those whose mission is to promote and expand recreational boating throughout Washington. In the following pages, you will find resources for reducing waste streams, preparing for and responding to spills, and communicating best practices to tenants. We have highlighted the most pertinent laws, illuminated potential pollution sources, and provided resources for implementing best management practices (BMPs). This handbook can be used as a reference and training tool for you and your staff. This document may be periodically updated. For the latest version, go to: wsg.washington.​edu/marine-​handbook."
