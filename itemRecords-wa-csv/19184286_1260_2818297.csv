13,Abstract:,"Minimizing the inadvertent co-extraction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibitors and/or subduing theirinfluence are two of the most pervasive challenges in the study of ancient DNA (aDNA). Some commonlyemploye​d methods to circumvent inhibition include dilution of DNA extracts and/or removal of inhibitors via silica-based treatments.Whil​e these methods have been shown to be effective, they may not be useful for all aDNAextracts. Samples with very low copy number, for instance, may not benefit from such methods, as dilutionslower DNA concentration in tandem with the inhibitors, and some DNA loss is expected to follow silica-​basedtreatments​. Therefore, the development of additional options to overcome PCR inhibition is at a premium. Inthis study, we present evidence that a reagent-rich PCR protocol, where all reagents are increased in equal relativeproport​ion can increase amplification success when DNA concentration is reduced relative to inhibitors. Thereagent-rich PCR recipe, termed rescue PCR, increased amplification success by 51% for the 112 extracts used inthe study. Rescue PCR represents a simple and robust addition to the suite of options currently available towork with DNA in the presence of inhibition, especially ancient, degraded, and low copy number DNA extracts."
