13,Abstract:,"In the pursuit of the defense responses in pea plants, or in any induced response in eukaryotic organisms, the sequence of the open reading frame of the induced gene is attainable from a cDNA clone. Once the open reading frame transcription start site of the cDNA clone has been obtained, the promoter region is often of interest and is accessible by inverse PCR. Although inverse PCR is a standard technique, all PCR strategies do not necessarily result in success. The promoter of the pea gene HMG I/Y is of interest because of the possibility that its coded protein is influencing its own transcription. The HMG I/Y protein contains four AT-hooks (2,5) that have affinity for AT-rich regions of DNA (4). The extensive research relative to this property has led to the recognition that HMG-I/Y is an architectural transcription factor (7). It has recently been determined that both its RNA transcript and its protein product are depleted as the pea defense response is initiated (4). The pea HMG I/Y protein can efficiently bind to AT-rich segments of promoters' from pea PR genes, genes that are activated as the pea tissue resists fungal pathogens (1,4). Therefore it was of interest to determine if such AT-rich regions were also present in the HMG I/Y's 5' region. This manuscript describes in detail the strategy used to sequence this promoter."
