15,Abstract:,"This bibliography is the result of a broad keyword search of all publications in the National Sea Grant Depository database. The search was limited to publications since 1984 with the keywords 'fisheries', 'fishery' and 'Magnuson Act'. The listing has been grouped by state program and geographic region; the types of issues addressed reflect the areas of expertise of the state's university faculties. However, many programs have on occasion funded projects addressing national and international issues."
