14,Abstract:,"To assess the physiological and phylogenetic diversity of culturable halophilic bacteria in deep-sea hydrothermal-​vent environments, six isolates obtained from low-temperature hydrothermal fluids, sulfide rock and hydrothermal plumes in North and South Pacific Ocean vent fields located at 1530� 2580 m depth were fully characterized. Three strains were isolated on media that contained oligotrophic concentrations of organic carbon (0.002 % yeast extract). Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene indicated that all strains belonged to the genus ""Halomonas"" in the gamma-subclass of the ""Proteobacteria​"". Consistent with previously described species, the novel strains were slightly to moderately halophilic and grew in media containing up to 22�27 % total salts. The isolates grew at temperatures as low as -1 to 2 deg C and had temperature optima of 30 or 20�35 deg C. Both the minimum and optimum temperatures for growth were similar to those of Antarctic and sea-ice ""Halomonas"" species and lower than typically observed for the genus as a whole. Phenotypic tests revealed that the isolates were physiologically versatile and tended to have more traits in common with each other than with closely related ""Halomonas"" species, presumably a reflection of their common deep-sea, hydrothermal-​vent habitat of origin. The G+C content of the DNA for all strains was 56.0�57.6 mol%, and DNA�DNA hybridization experiments revealed that four strains (Eplume1^T, Esulfide1^T, Althf1^T and Slthf2^T) represented novel species and that two strains (Eplume2 and Slthf1) were related to ""Halomonas meridiana"". The proposed new species names are ""Halomonas neptunia"" (type strain Eplume1^T=ATCC BAA-805^T=CECT 5815^T=DSM 15720^T), ""Halomonas sulfidaeris"" (type strain Esulfide1^T=ATC​C BAA- 803^T=CECT 5817^T=DSM 15722^T), ""Halomonas axialensis"" (type strain Althf1T=ATCC BAA-802^T=CECT 5812^T=DSM 15723^T) and ""Halomonas hydrothermalis"" (type strain Slthf2^T=ATCC BAA-800^T=CECT 5814^T=DSM 15725^T)."
