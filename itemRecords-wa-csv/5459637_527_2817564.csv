12,Abstract:,"The Manila clam, Tapes philippinarum, was unintentionally introduced into British Columbia and Willapa Bay and Puget Sound, Washington, presumably from Japan where the Manila clam is a widely used commercial species. Manila clams now form the basis of a clam fishery along the northwest coast of North America. The high commercial value of the Manila clam has led to a desire to formulate techniques for its commercial culture. The purpose of this study was to examine the duration of the spawning season of T. philippinarum and develop a methodology for hatchery rearing of its larvae."
