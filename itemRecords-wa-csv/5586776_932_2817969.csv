15,Abstract:,"In the fifty years since its accidental introduction into Puget Sound (in shipments of oyster seed from Japan), the Manila clam, ""Venerupis japonica"", has established itself so firmly in the region that it is now the area's major steamer clam. Commercial and recreational clam growers prize the Manila clam for its quick growth, adaptability to culture, ease of harvest, and long shelf life. About 3.4 million pounds of Manila clams were harvested commercially in Washington in 1990, but that is only half the production needed to meet current demand. This manual covers Manila clam production from hatchery to harvest. Algae culture is discussed for growers who wish to grow their own algae for remote setting and nursery culture of juveniles. The information in this guide is tailored to the Pacific Northwest, but it may be useful in other geographic locations and for other species of clams."
