9,Abstract:,"The author examines trends in the marine sciences that he believes are not adequately recognized either intellectually or institutionally​. These trends are proceeding so quickly that they outstrip our collective ability to cope. Among the problems he identifies: (1) satellite technology is creating a data glut that challenges our capacity to manage or even seriously address it; (2) efforts to restore degraded ecosystems tend to proceed without adequate attention to reorganizing the institutions and political processes that brought about biological demise; (3) the long productive relationship between ocean science and the military is breaking down as multinational research is increasingly perceived as a threat to national security; and (4) as scientific research becomes more and more specialized, scientists are finding it difficult not only to share their knowledge with each other but also to communicate it to private citizens and their designated decision-​makers. Some approaches for the ocean sciences community to follow in tackling these problems are offered."
