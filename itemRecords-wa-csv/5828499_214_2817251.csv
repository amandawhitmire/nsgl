7,Abstract:,"Washington County, in southern Rhode Island, is known for its rural landscapes, small towns and scenic beaches. But, the county is also changing rapidly, and is experiencing the fastest rate of growth in Rhode Island. In 1999, the Washington County Regional Planning Council, which includes town officials, the Washington Trust Co. and URI's Rhode Island Sea Grant Program, realized that the region's rapid growth was beginning to threaten the very quality of life that attracted residents and tourists to the area. They initiated a visioning process (""Vision 2020: A shared future?""), and conducted numerous workshops and interviews to identify concerns and hopes for the future of the area. These articles, reprinted from the ""Providence Journal"", are designed to make readers aware of the issues shaping the future of the region's towns and villages. The series discusses the issues on which ""Vision 2020"" was built. During the next year, the council and other partners will use the vision to promote actions that will move the county toward an attractive and more sustainable future."
