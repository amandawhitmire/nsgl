12,Abstract:,"Fish marking is an important tool for fisheries management and research. Common uses include studies of population dynamics and migration, and planning for the efficient harvest of cultured and wild fish populations. Marks and tags frequently are necessary to keep track of experimental lots of fish in hatcheries or aquaria. A variety of natural and artificial marks and tagging techniques are potentially available to the fishery biologist: external, internal, chemical, electronic, and genetic. The use of genetic marks in fisheries studies, primarily allozyme marks, is reviewed here. Allozyme analysis by horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis is currently the most common and readily available genetic technique for fisheries research and management."
