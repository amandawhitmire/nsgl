15,Abstract:,"The feeding ecology of steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss, was investigated during the summers (June-July) of 1991-2007 in the North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska. The dominant prey items for all age groups were gonatid squid (mostly Berryteuthis anonychus) and fish (including Pleurogrammus monopterygius, Gasterosteus aculeatusand myctophidae). The composite energy density of the diet (J/g) increased as the percent composition of squid increased in the diet, suggesting that squid are the preferred prey item. The stomach fullness and percent composition of squid in the diet was inversely related to the abundance of Asian pink salmon, O. gorbuscha, in the north Pacific, agreeing with previous studies that have found evidence for interspecific competition among Oncorhynchus spp. in the North Pacific."
