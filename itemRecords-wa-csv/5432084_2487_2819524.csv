10,Abstract:,"Thyroid hormones have been implicated in control of salmonid smoltification for over half a century, yet the role of thyroid hormones in coordinating this developmental event, which allows young salmonids to change from fresh- to seawater habitation, remains poorly understood. In this paper the evidence for thyroidal control of metabolic and developmental processes during smoltification is reviewed, and the potential problems in interpreting in-vivo responses of juvenile salmonids to exogenously administered thyroid hormones is discussed. Some hypotheses concerning how thyroid hormones may act to promote smolt development are offered to provide a conceptual framework for future studies."
