10,Abstract:,"Size-at-instar, growth-​per-​molt, reproductive schedules, and morphometric allometries were investigated in four sympatric species of ""Cancer (magister"", the Dungeness crab; ""gracilis""; ""productus""; and ""oregonensis)"" in Garrison Bay, North Puget Sound. Complementary observations were made on mating systems, mortality, habitat utilization patterns, and feeding. Numerical methods were successfully employed to discriminate instars in size-frequency distributions. Contemporary studies of diversity within decapod guilds have frequently been done with food-resource partitioning as an explicit or implicit hypothesis. In contrast, this study stresses the importance of habitat, mating systems, and sexual selection as primary mechanisms underlying the diversification of this genus."
