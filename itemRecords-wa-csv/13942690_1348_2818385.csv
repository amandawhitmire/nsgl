11,Abstract:,"The Puget Sound Partnership (“the Partnership”), in its 2020 Recovery Target for Puget Sound, recognized that one strategy for protecting and restoring habitat along Puget Sound is to remove or reduce construction of armoring and encourage design of soft-shore alternatives on residential properties. However, the typical shoreline homeowner may not have access to information about alternative approaches for addressing specific conditions on his or her property. Washington Sea Grant (WSG), with guidance from the Partnership, conducted research to determine the components necessary for providing technical assistance to shoreline homeowners. This report describes the results of the research and provides a framework for determining what would be included in a comprehensive regional technical assistance program. This program framework can be used by the Partnership, state agencies, or nonprofits in the Puget Sound region to evaluate how to build such a program. The research was based on interviews conducted with 18 individuals; 12 of these individuals are engaged in some aspect of shoreline technical assistance in the Puget Sound region. Two of the interviewees work with programs in Maryland and were included because of the relevance of those programs to providing technical assistance to shoreline homeowners. WSG developed the interview sample using a chain referral method starting with recommendations from the Partnership and WSG staff. Each interviewee was asked to suggest additional interviewees. The interviews posed a series of questions related to areas of service, key people in the process, required knowledge and expertise, and funding requirements. These questions were designed to solicit information about the structure and function of technical assistance programs. Five programs were evaluated in greater depth because of the comprehensive nature of services provided. Interviews for these programs became the primary basis for the findings. Write-ups from these five interviews are included in the appendices to the report. Nine key topics emerged addressing various aspects of shoreline technical assistance programs. In addition, four major elements of technical assistance programs emerged. These elements were used to develop five program models."
