10,Abstract:,"Undergraduate education about the ocean, particularly in the sciences, has been dealt with in myriad ways and continues to generate debate about what constitutes the best approach. In the natural sciences, the alternatives center on two ideas: (1) offer an ocean-titled undergraduate degree program (e.g., University of Washington, University of Miami, Texas A&M University Galveston, University of Rhode Island, University of Michigan) or (2) offer only masters and doctoral level degrees (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Oregon State University). Until 1991 the University of Hawaii (UH) system subscribed exclusively to the latter philosophy; the flagship UH-Manoa campus still offers no ocean-titled undergraduate degrees (such as marine biology, oceanography, fisheries, aquaculture, ocean engineering, marine policy, and so on). The UH-Hilo campus now offers a B.A. in marine science. Since 1971 many of the educational needs of UH undergraduates throughout the 10-campus system have been met through the Marine Option Program (MOP). In 1989 programs were introduced for graduate students as well. MOP may serve as a useful, cost effective educational model for other institutions. Responding to student demands for more relevant education in the late 1960s and early 1970s, MOP was conceived and initially implemented through the creativity and perseverance of John Craven (then UH dean of marine programs), Jack Davidson (director, UH Sea Grant College Program), and Barry Hill (a graduate student in tropical agriculture and the first director of MOP, 1971-75). MOP has evolved substantially over the years, never quite fitting any traditional pigeonhole in the university structure, but nevertheless contributing a significant element to the marine education of thousands of UH students. This is accomplished primarily through three vehicles: award of academic certificates, a vigorous experiential education activities program, and academic and career counseling and outreach. After 23 years, MOP currently employs 10 faculty (all but one contribute only part of their time to MOP), two educational specialists, a secretary, and numerous students on four campuses in the UH system (UH-Manoa, UH-Hilo, Maui Community College, Windward Community College). Over 500 students from eight campuses are now enrolled in the program; a total of 439 undergraduates and 6 graduates have completed certificates."
