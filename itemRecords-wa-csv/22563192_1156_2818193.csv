17,Abstract:,"Pacific salmon acquire most of their biomass in the ocean before returning to spawn and die incoastal streams and lakes, thus providing subsidies of marine-derived nitrogen (MDN) to freshwater andterrestrial ecosystems. Recent declines in salmon abundance have raised questions of whether managersshould mitigate for losses of salmon MDN subsidies. To test the long-term importance of salmon subsidiesto riparian ecosystems, we measured soil nitrogen cycling in response to a 20-yr manipulation where salmon carcasses were systematically removed from one bank and deposited on the opposite bank along a 2-km stream in southwestern Alaska. Soil samples were taken at different distances from the stream bankalong nine paired transects and measured for organic and inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and nitrogentransfo​rmation rates. Marine-derived nitrogen was measured using 15N/14N for bulk soils, and NHþ4 andNO3 soil pools. Stable isotope analyses confirmed 15N/14N was elevated on the salmon-enhanced bankcompared to the salmon-depleted bank. However, 15N/14N values of plant-available inorganic nitrogenexceede​d the 15N/14N of salmon inputs, highlighting nitrogen isotope fractionation in soils that raises significant methodological issues with standard MDN assessments in riparian systems. Surprisingly, despite20 yr of salmon supplementation​, the presence of MDN did not cause a long-term increase in soil nitrogenavailab​ility. This finding indicates the importance of MDN to ecosystem nitrogen biogeochemistry​, andriparian vegetation may be overestimated for some systems. Given that essential nutrients can also be pollutants, we urge more critical analyses of the role of MDN to inform compensatory mitigation programstargeti​ng salmon nutrient enhancement."
