13,Abstract:,"The plan provides an example of best practices. It is for training purposes only and does not represent any specific operation. Development of a food safety plan is site-specific, and plans for each location should be developed separately. This model includes both required and optional information to illustrate how a food safety plan might be designed under regulations in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 112, 117, and 123, associated with the Food Safety Modernization Act (Public Law (PL) 111-353). Conditions and specifications used (e.g., validation information) are for illustrative purposes only and may not represent actual process conditions. Gre​en Aquaponics LLC was established in 2000 as an aquaculture farm in Idaho, first developed for producing fish, specifically male blue tilapia (Tilapia aurea) and in 2010, Green Aquaponics coupled its indoor aquaculture system with an indoor fresh produce production unit into an aquaponics system and expanded operations to their Washington facility in Aquatown. This company produces lettuces on rafts in a recirculation system. The aquaculture capacity is 10,000 lb of tilapia per year. The hydroponic area is 12,000 square feet in an indoor production system with an indoor raft system producing approximately 90,000 lb per year presuming a harvestable crop of lettuce every 4 weeks after transplant. The first harvestable fish follow in 9 months and are then harvested monthly based upon market demand. The water source is tested potable well water that feeds the aquaculture section, and after passing through the aquaculture section proceeds through a biofilter converting ammonia to nitrate providing water for irrigating the fresh produce. Water quality entering the produce unit is tested at least monthly to ensure that it meets requirements under the Produce Safety Rule. The light source is partially from natural light plus LED based artificial lighting. The company sells live fish to local restaurants and whole fish (bled and eviscerated), shipped on fresh water ice, to local distributers and retailers. Lettuce is packed in plastic clamshells or plastic-​coated cardboard boxes with ice as needed and then shipped to local distributers."
