17,Abstract:,"Sponges contain large numbers of bacteria that are embedded within the animal matrix. With this study, researchers provide general insights into the identity, diversity, and distribution patterns of sponge-​associated microbes. The sponges ""Theonella swinhoei"" (order Lithistida) and ""Aplysina aerophoba"" (order Verongida) were chosen because they are only distantly related, have nonoverlapping distribution patterns, and contain different host-specific secondary metabolite profiles. The results surprisingly reveal a uniform, yet phylogeneticall​y complex, microbial population in sponges from different oceans."
