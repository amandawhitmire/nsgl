12,Abstract:,"The Patuxent River, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, has served as a model system for efforts to understand the basic functioning of estuarine systems, to apply scientific principles and discoveries to management, and to implement and test management strategies. The siting of two research laboratories along its shores, the location of its watershed entirely within the state of Maryland and near the United States capital in Washington, D.C., and concern about its ecological condition by citizens within its watershed have led to the Patuxent playing a unique role as a test case for water quality and habitat restoration. The focus of this special issue is two-fold. The first goal is to present papers on the ecology and management of the Patuxent River to provide a portrait of this well studied system from a variety of perspectives. The second goal is to present integrative results of a series of linked studies that directly connect economics, land use, nutrient dynamics, biogeochemistry​, food web ecology, and fisheries in a single publication."
