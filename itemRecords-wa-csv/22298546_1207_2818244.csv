8,Abstract:,"On April 7, 2017 many law and policy experts, scientists, practitioners, â€‹ and managers met at the University of Oregon School of Law to discuss coastal resiliency in the face of environmental change. The symposium addressed an identified gap in the law and policy literature related to management of coastal resources in a changing world, addressing questions such as: How does our existing legal framework accommodate issues such as climate change or coastal development? Can laws help balance between use of and benefit derived from coastal resources? What is needed to develop policies that encompass needs from various jurisdictions, and what are best practices to engage coastal practitioners and decision makers? Ocean acidification, sea level rise and their impact on coastal development, and energy issues- both renewable and nonrenewable- were the main topics discussed. The following articles are in this Special Issue: Introduction to the Special Issue on coastal resiliency in the face of environmental change: are current laws and policies flexible for a changing world? By Shelby E. Walker, p. 1; Coastal resilience for the electric power system: a national overview and the Oregon example, by Adam Schultz and Rebecca O'Neil, p. 3; Washington's estuaries: where freshwater meets saltwater and protection schemes collide, by Maggie Franquemont, p. 25; Still spinning: a look at the federal landscape of offshore wind energy in the United States, by Wilson Jarrell, p. 45; Learning to play well with others: a proposed international solution to mitigating ocean acidification, by Elizabeth A.
