11,Abstract:,"Welcome to the Washington Coast Shellfish Aquaculture Timeline. This project is part of the Washington Coast Shellfish Aquaculture Study project, which is an effort to improve the long-term sustainability of shellfish aquaculture in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor under changing environmental conditions. The Study is coordinated by Washington Sea Grant and advised by a team of independent scientists and a diverse working group representing owners, managers, and regulators of tideland resources in the two estuaries. This Study is intended to provide solutions to current challenges and support the creation of an ongoing structure to facilitate problem-solving as they arise in our region for shellfish growers. The timeline is a working document providing an overview of the history of shellfish aquaculture and its challenges and giving a sense of the juxtaposition of major events related to shellfish aquaculture, specifically in the Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor estuaries of Washington State from 1850 to the present."
