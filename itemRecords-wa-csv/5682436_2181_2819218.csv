12,Abstract:,"Backscatter imaging, the only simple technique available to produce continuous two-dimensional records of the water column, has returned spectacular images of internal waves, hydraulic phenomena, and buoyant plumes. However, the interpretation of backscatter images is ambiguous because several mechanisms can produce backscatter of similar intensities: reflection from centimeter-​scale density steps (micro-​structure); Rayleigh scattering from nonresonant particles; volume reverberation of ensonified bubbles, principally subducted air bubbles and the swim bladders of zooplankton and fish; and scattering from indexof-​refraction fluctuations. In this paper, the authors present what is thought to be the first simultaneous measurements of calibrated acoustic returns and turbulent microstructure, collected in a set of 20-m-tail billows. Scattering due to turbulent microstructure alone is strong enough to explain the measured backscatter at specific sites within the billows; existing formulations underestimate the strength of acoustic backscatter from turbulent microstructure."
