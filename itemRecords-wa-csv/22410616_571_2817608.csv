10,Abstract:,"This annual report provides metrics and results from the 2018 NOAA Science Camp. It is a self-motivated, cumulative learning experience that is at the core of real-world science learning. Camp activities integrate NOAA science into high-quality educational materials through a curriculum that meets state education standards, as well as all Ocean Literacy Essential Principles. Complex concepts are presented in innovative and interesting ways that engage campers and demonstrate that science can be fun. Science activities are blended with other enriching camp experiences — playing field games, gaining confidence through team-​building and fostering new friendships with fellow campers. Since its inception in 2003, NOAA Science Camp has evolved into a highly regarded, collaborative science program. More than 10 NOAA offices, Washington Sea Grant (WSG) and the Joint Institute for Study of the Atmosphere and Oceans (JISAO) partner to introduce middle and high school students to the multidisciplina​ry nature of research. Scientists and educators interact directly with camp participants to demonstrate how NOAA research addresses environmental issues on both local and international scales."
