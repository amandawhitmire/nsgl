12,Abstract:,"An experimental study was carried out to investigate the maximum run-up of non-breaking solitary waves on both smooth and rough plane beaches. Artificial beaches with different slopes and bottom roughness were studied. Experimental results showed that for waves running up relatively steep (e.g., 20 degree) slopes viscosity and roughness have little effect on the maximum run-up. In such cases, the inviscid long wave theories are adequate for predicting the run-up height. However, for waves running up over mildly sloped beaches, the viscous and roughness effects were found to be very significant and can reduce the maximum run-up by more than 50% compared with the inviscid predictions."
