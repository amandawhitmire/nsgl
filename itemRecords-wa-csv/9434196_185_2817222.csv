13,Abstract:,"Discovery Bay on the Strait of Juan de Fuca in Washington State is one of the most important sites in this area from a coastal hazards standpoint. Why? Because written in the sediments of the salt marsh at the head of the bay is a record of multiple tsunamis, that are manifested as sand layers sandwiched between layers of peat."
