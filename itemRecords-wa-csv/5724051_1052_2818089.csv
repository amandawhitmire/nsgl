10,Abstract:,"Traditional western state water law tends to ignore the effects of diversion. Each diversion can increase the concentration of natural or human-caused contaminants in the water. Two reasons such water uses have not been controlled are (1) the number of small, individual uses involved, and (2) a tradition by federal and state legislators of respecting long-used state water allocations as property- like rights when designing pollution control laws. Fortunately, water law is evolving toward greater recognition of the links between quantity allocations and water quality. Facets of that evolution are discussed here. Particularly important are watershed management plans."
