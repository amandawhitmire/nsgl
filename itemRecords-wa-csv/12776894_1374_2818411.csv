18,Abstract:,"There are many challenges to achieving local-​levelclimate resilience, including limited access to detailed climate projections, limited inclusion of traditional ecological knowledge, and difficulty in establishing effective climate change impact dialogue across sectors and the community at large. In 2013, the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribeinitiated a project to identify and begin addressing the risk the community faces from climate change. Using a combination of structured sector-specific meetings and a two-day workshop, the project used a collaborative approach to identify vulnerabilities​, select and prioritize key areas of concern, and develop adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience. This approach allowed community members to focus their limited time and resources on the areas and assets that are most important to them. The approach also increased understanding of how climate change will impact the community and the strategies available to reduce vulnerability to those impacts. Preparing for the impacts of climate change, like addressing other sustainability issues, is not an outcome but a process. The approach taken by the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe lays a solid foundation for that process and positions the Tribe to build climate resilience, protect and maintain important resources, ensure continued economic growth, and promote long-term community and cultural vitality."
