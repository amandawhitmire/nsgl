11,Abstract:,"Although many marine species are known to employ algal toxins sequestered from their diets as defensive agents, relatively little is known about how these species avoid autotoxicity. Dinoflagellates of the genus ""Protogonyaulaxâ€‹"" have been identified as the source of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSPT). The butter clam ""Saxidomus giganteus"" is unique among bivalves with respects to PSPT toxicology. Neurons from the butter clam and its congener ""S. nuttalli"" were shown to be 10 to 100 times more resistant to the PSPT saxitoxin (STX) than those from 4 co-occurring infaunal bivalves. No difference in sensitivity to STX was found between butter clams from 3 sites with different histories of toxin contamination (chronically, occasionally or never toxic) suggesting that the resistance of this species to STX is innate rather than acquired with increased exposure. Because predators have been shown to reject bivalve prey contaminated with STX, long-term retention of this toxin may have been favored in the butter clam as an acquired chemical defense."
