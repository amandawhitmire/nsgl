11,Abstract:,"Over the past four decades marine aquaculture has grown rapidly around the world as countries and individual companies seek opportunities to produce more seafood for local consumption and export markets. The increase in global aquaculture production during this time has been dramatic, expanding from less than 5 million metric tons (mmt) in the mid-1970s to 60 mmt in 2010, with aquaculture products now comprising approximately half of all seafood we eat. The global aquaculture industry is expected to continue its expansion, and the purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for stakeholders committed to sustainable marine aquaculture which safeguards the ocean. While demand for seafood continues to increase, harvest fisheries have plateaued. As most wild fish stocks are either fully or overexploited, any significant increase in seafood supply will likely come from aquaculture production. Expansion of freshwater aquaculture may be limited due to competition for available land and water from agriculture and other uses. With technologies and equipment now being developed to withstand harsh ocean environments, there is an increasing interest in coastal and offshore marine aquaculture. Past and current marine aquaculture practices have demonstrated the need for proper siting and management to avoid negative impacts to the marine environment while ensuring optimal growing conditions. Early efforts to develop marine aquaculture did not always give sufficient consideration to potential negative impacts, resulting in environmental effects, such as destruction of marine habitats, introduction of non-native species, eutrophication, and disease outbreaks. In some parts of the world, concerns remain about marine aquaculture practices, such as improper siting or management protocols that continue to pose a risk to marine environments. Coastal managers and communities must balance the risks of marine aquaculture with its benefits including job creation, reducing seafood imports, and enhancing food security. Examples from the U.S. and elsewhere demonstrate that properly sited and managed marine aquaculture operations meet environmental regulatory requirements and can be environmentally sustainable while coexisting with other coastal uses. Modern, effective management tools include models to predict impacts to water quality and benthic environments, standardized monitoring protocols, biosecurity, integrated pest management, vaccines that reduce or eliminate the need to use antibiotics and other therapeutants, consideration of genetic impacts to wild populations, and improved cage systems and fish handling practices to reduce the incidence of escapes. In Maine, Washington, Hawaii, and elsewhere, state and federal agencies have worked with industry to develop permitting and management systems that make the U.S. aquaculture industry one of the most environmentally responsible in the world. When coastal managers are provided appropriate tools, marine aquaculture can produce domestic seafood while providing economic opportunities to coastal communities and maintaining healthy oceans. There is interest in the U.S. Caribbean in establishing a marine aquaculture industry to produce seafood for local and export markets. For example, the company Snapperfarm, Inc. established a cobia cage culture operation off the island of Culebra in Puerto Rico in 2003. Subsequent efforts to obtain a permit to expand were not successful, and the company shifted operations to Panama in 2009. While no marine finfish cage culture operations currently operate in the U.S. Caribbean, potential investors remain interested in the industry once the permitting process is more straightforwardâ€‹. Given the presence of sensitive coral reef habitats in the area, coastal managers and researchers, including members the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, expressed concern about the environmental risks of marine finfish cage culture in and near coral habitats, and have highlighted the need for comprehensive management strategies to mitigate potential negative impacts. Currently, environmental reviews of marine aquaculture permits in the U.S. Caribbean are addressed on a case-bycase basis. Representatives from the aquaculture industry and coastal managers agree that Best Management Practices (BMPs) for marine cage culture operations would provide a valuable standard reference to assess aquaculture permit applications and refine permit criteria. In 2010, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) convened a workshop in conjunction with the 63rd Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico to begin developing BMPs for marine cage culture operations in the U.S. Caribbean, with emphasis on reducing impacts to coral reef habitats. The workshop participants included managers from federal, state, and territory regulatory agencies, researchers, university professors, representatives from environmental organizations, and the aquaculture industry. The participants included experts in the regulatory processes, coral reef ecology, marine habitat monitoring and assessment, water quality and benthic modeling, and marine aquaculture. The goal of the workshop was to produce an initial list of key elements to include in the BMPs that would reduce potential impacts to coral ecosystems from marine finfish aquaculture (Appendix IV, Table 1) and identify management tools that reduce or eliminate environmental impacts. The outcomes of this workshop formed the basis upon which these BMPs were further developed by teams of experts working together to craft each chapter. Once the chapters were completed and compiled, over 20 expert reviewers, most of whom participated in the workshop, provided input to improve and refine the final BMP report. These BMPs represent guidelines, developed collaboratively by a diverse stakeholder group that can be voluntarily implemented at marine cage culture operations in U.S. territorial waters of the Caribbean. These Best Management Practices will be useful to many stakeholders. Farm owners and operators can apply them to guide siting and farm management practices. Coastal managers and community planners can use this information to make environmentally responsible decisions about the economic opportunities that aquaculture offers. Federal, state, and local regulatory agencies can consider these practices as they develop and implement permitting and monitoring processes for the Caribbean offshore aquaculture industry. These Best Management Practices are a tool for implementing responsible marine cage culture which safeguards and maintains healthy ocean ecosystems."
