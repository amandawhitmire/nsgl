10,Abstract:,"Global environmental change is not a new phenomenon. Since the beginning, the earth and its resources, the climate and the atmosphere have been continuously changing since they constitute a dynamic system. What is unique is the accelerated role of change and the possible resultant impacts on the environment. Human technology now has the capability of radically altering the global ecosystem. Currently there is considerable debate within the scientific community about 'facts' and potential impacts of global change. Despite the scientific debate, the paucity of information, and the uncertainty of future climatic events, national and international decisions and policies are being made to deal with global climate change issues. This article reviews the situation, directing itself primarily to education. The need for us all to develop a 'global ethic' is stressed, and a plea is made on behalf of bringing these issues responsibly into the classroom and other avenues of education."
