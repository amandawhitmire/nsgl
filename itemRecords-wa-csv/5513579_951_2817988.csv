12,Abstract:,"The use of west coast estuaries and protected bays as nursery grounds by English sole, ""Parophrys vetulus"" Girard, a significant component of Pacific coast groundfish landings, has been well documented. This study was conducted to (1) compare relative density and estimates of abundance of juvenile English sole between a Washington estuary, Grays Harbor, and the adjacent area along the open coast; (2) compare fish density between several subareas of each system; and (3) note timing of immigration to and emigration from the estuary. Specific gear was developed to efficiently sample small benthic organisms and was used in both the estuary and open coast survey areas, eliminating the need for gear selectivity intercalibratioâ€‹n."
