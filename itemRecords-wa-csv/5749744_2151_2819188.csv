10,Abstract:,"The adoption of 'Best Management Practices' (BMPs) may, at first glance, offer a proven remedy to solve a nagging pollution problem. Occasionally, state or federal agencies may offer grants to help facilities establish pollution prevention programs, but those agencies are not necessarily willing to share in the liability if anything goes awry. Because it is such a complicated issue, it would be unusual to find a BMP that describes both the risks and benefits of becoming a 'Small Quantity Generator.' Such generators are responsible for all the used oil and hazardous waste they collect. They must arrange for safe collection, storage, labeling, transportation and eventual disposal or recycling. The line between being an environmental showcase and being subject to severe EPA penalties is narrow, vague, and easy to cross unawares. Marinas should carefully scrutinize each BMP application to ensure that they are not applying a technical solution to eliminate a problem, only to create a more complex problem with possibly significant legal ramifications."
