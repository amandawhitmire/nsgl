11,Abstract:,"This white paper is divided into the following three sections: 1) synthesis of the state of knowledge of scales of organization in the various U.S. west coast groundfish fisheries, 2) identification and prioritization of spatial matches and mismatches between various components of the west coast groundfish fishery, and 3) recommendations for spatial management of west coast groundfish within the context of ecosystem-based fishery management (Field and Francis 2006, Francis et al. 2007, Levin and Lubchenco 2008). In this regard, the paper suggests that spatial management should: Consider spatial aspects of interactions between humans and nature (McEvoy 1986, 1996), Incorporate the capacity for resilience thinking (Walker and Salt 2006), Be ""second stream"" in its approach to both science (interdisciplin​ary, holistic, focus on understanding rather than prediction) and management (facilitate existing processes and variability, proactive rather than reactive; Francis et al. 2007, Holling 1993, Holling and Meffe 1996), Employ rules which are as simple as possible in achieving the desired results (Berkes and Berkes in review)."
