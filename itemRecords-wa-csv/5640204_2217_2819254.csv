11,Abstract:,"The green alga ""Acetabularia acetabulum"", a classic research organism in cell biology, is amendable to genetic studies. There are only two known mating types and, since each cell makes gametes of both haploid mating types in separate gametangia, an ""Acetabularia"" cell can self and outcross. However, because the life cycle is long and mating efficiency is low, there have been few genetic studies of this cell or selections of phenotypic mutants. This paper reports improving zygote recovery 11 to 1,000 fold by optimizing the physiology of gamete release and mating in ""A. acetabulum"". Gamete release was affected by agar purity, concentration, and volume/gametangâ€‹ial pair."
