10,Abstract:,"This glossary targets the commercial fishing industry and reflects the current terminology used. However, because the industry is constantly evolving and new terms are being added, the intention is to update the glossary periodically to reflect these changes. With regard to the names of finfish, it is suggested that this glossary be used in conjunction with ""The Fish List"" developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which provides the legally recognized names for finfish sold in the United States. Since no official marketing list for shellfish sold in the United States exists to date, the ""Code of Federal Regulations"" is referred to in the appropriate places in the glossary."
