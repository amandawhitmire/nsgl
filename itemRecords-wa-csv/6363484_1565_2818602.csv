9,Abstract:,"Maintaining good health and a sense of well-being are top priorities for many people today. Both health and well-being are strongly related to diet. The relationship of diet to overall health and the effect of diet on the incidence of certain chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer, continue to be active areas of nutrition research. Compared to the past, people today are generally more careful in managing their diets to reduce the chances of contracting life-​threatening diseases. People are also paying more attention to better manage any diseases they may already have and to change their lifestyles to sustain longer and healthier lives. Based on current dietary recommendations​, this paper examines whether shellfish should be included in a healthful diet."
