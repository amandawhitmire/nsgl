11,Abstract:,"Natural chemical constituents of living organisms called natural products have historically been used to treat human infections and diseases. This brief encyclopedic report describes how techniques in molecular biology have merged with those in natural products chemistry to facilitate the generation of natural products through combinatorial biosynthesis, metabolic engineering, and potentially, biosynthesis of uncultured microorganisms."
