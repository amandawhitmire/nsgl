10,Abstract:,"On May 1, 1998, members and staff of the Stratton Commission, whose work in 1969 led to the founding of NOAA, enactment of the 1972 Coastal Zone Management Act, and other important advances in ocean and coastal management, met with today's ocean and coastal leaders. They discussed the establishment and accomplishments of the 1960s commission, current proposals for a new ocean commission, changed conditions, and lessons learned. This is a synopsis of that meeting."
