11,Abstract:,"Annually, Alaska longline fishermen set about 200 million hooks for Pacific halibut, Pacific cod, turbot, and rockfish. With these hooks, they incidentally capture a variety of seabirds, including the short-tailed albatross, an endangered species. The capture of as few as six short- tails over two years could lead to the interruption or closure of these fisheries. This video provides information to help Alaska longline fishermen avoid catching seabirds and protect their fisheries. It portrays a variety of seabird species, in flight and interacting with longline gear. It also demonstrates how to rig and deploy streamer lines - a seabird bycatch deterrent now required on most Alaska longlines."
