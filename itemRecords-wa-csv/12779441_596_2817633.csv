10,Abstract:,"Two species of eelgrass can be found in Padilla Bay, Washington (Zostera japonica and Zostera marina) and act as a bioindicators of ecosystem health. Many factors can contribute to the status of an eelgrass bed, including light, temperature, salinity, and nutrients. However, following several cases of seagrass die-off events worldwide, another factor is suspected to contribute to eelgrass health: pore-water sulfide. This study examined the relationships between Z. japonica, Z. marina, and pore-water sulfide in Padilla Bay and the effects of elevated pore-water sulfide concentrations on eelgrass."
