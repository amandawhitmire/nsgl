15,Abstract:,"Polycyclic aromatic polyketides, such as the tetracyclines and anthracyclines, are synthesized by bacterial aromatic polyketide synthases (PKSs). A unique polyketide biosynthetic pathway recently identified in the marine strain ""Streptomyces maritimus"" deviates from the normal aromatic PKS model in the generation of a diverse series of chiral, non-aromatic polyketides. Here the researchers describe the cloning and sequencing of the gene cluster encoding the biosynthesis of the enterocin and wailupemycin family of polyketides from ""S. maritimus."" The novel type II gene set differs from all other aromatic PKS clusters by the absence of cyclase and aromatase encoding genes and the presence of genes encoding the biosynthesis and attachment of the unique benzoyl-CoA starter unit."
