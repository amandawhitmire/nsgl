9,Abstract:,"Sulfide toxicity, coupled with other environmental stressors, are implicatedin seagrass declines worldwide. Yet, studies examining the relationship betweenseagrass presence and sulfide concentrations have yielded conflicting results.Interpr​etation of the seagrass-​sulfide relationship is complicated due to theopposing effects of the root system which can increase sulfide oxidation and theburial of organic matter from the plant itself which can increase sulfide productionvia anaerobic sulfate reduction. To quantify the impact of eelgrass leaf detritus andthe Zostera marina rhizosphere on pore-water sulfide concentrations, field samplesof pore-water sulfide were collected in areas with and without eelgrass. To decouplethe effects of live versus dead eelgrass tissue, laboratory studies were conductedover 4 weeks using 10 aquaria with or without eelgrass shoots and 0-8 pieces of Z.marina detritus located at 4 cm and 11 cm depth. Diffusive Gradients in Thin-​Films(DGTs) were used to obtain 2D visualizations of sulfide concentrations within thesediment in relation to location of eelgrass detritus and the rhizosphere. In the fieldstudy, the presence of leaf detritus accounted for higher than average sulfideconcentr​ations in the sediment, both within and outside eelgrass beds. In thelaboratory study, the presence of live eelgrass shoots resulted in higher overallsulfide concentrations compared to aquaria without eelgrass. Sulfideconcentr​ations, localized around the leaf detritus additions, increased with highermass of added detritus compared to locations where no detritus was added.Sediment within the rhizosphere exhibited reduced sulfide concentrationsc​ompared sediment outside the rhizosphere. In addition, higher sulfide concentrations were typically found at deeper depths. These results indicate why insome cases seagrasses lower sulfide concentrations and in others increaseconcent​rations. It is likely that seagrasses are simultaneously increasing anddecreasing sulfide concentrations depending on the location analyzed relative to therhizosphere or buried eelgrass detritus."
