13,Abstract:,"The influence of oceanic larval transport on Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") year class strength measured at the time of settlement to the benthos was studied using trawl survey data collected along the coast of Washington and in adjacent estuaries during 1983-88. It is hypothesized that larvae do not reach optimal juvenile habitat nearshore and in estuaries, and that strong year classes are not possible, unless the coastal circulation retains larvae nearshore and in relative proximity to suitable benthic habitat. It is suggested that interannual variation in recruitment to coastal populations is closely linked to alongshore advective processes. These conclusions diverge from the prevailing recruitment paradigm for the species, which stresses cross-shelf advection of larvae."
