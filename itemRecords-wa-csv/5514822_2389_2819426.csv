10,Abstract:,This paper provides an account of the author's glimpses of a few aspects of the administrative and policy environments under which ocean research is carried out. Discussion is centered around four main topics: (1) how to keep ocean scientists in the ocean policy loop; (2) long-range planning and program development at the federal level; (3) how funding should be distributed among programs vs. projects; and (4) the `soft money' problem. Some conclusions and recommendations for the future are presented.
