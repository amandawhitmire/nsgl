The Rhode Island Sea Grant College Program/Univers​ity of Rhode Island Coastal Resources Center (Sea Grant/CRC) is helping coastal communities preserve the best of the past and take stock of the present to plan for the future. The Sustainable Coastal Communities Initiative supports state and local efforts on Aquldneck Island and in Washington County to achieve resources management goals through regional cooperation. As one of 30 Sea Grant College programs around the country, Sea Grant/CRC is a participant in a National Sea Grant College Program effort to strengthen coastal planning, stimulate integrated coastal management, and support community and economic development."
