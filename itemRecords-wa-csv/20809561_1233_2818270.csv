20,Abstract:,"The nearshore is a critical zone for northeastPacifi​c Ocean fish communities, including ecologicallyand culturally important salmon species. The largest damremoval in the world was recently completed on the ElwhaRiver, with the goal of restoring fisheries and ecosystemsto the watershed. The nearshore Elwha fish community wasmonitored monthly from January 2008 to November 2015before, during and after dam removal. As of September2015, approximately 2.6 million m3of sediment materialhad increased the area of the Elwha delta to over 150 ha.Newly formed nearshore habitats were quickly colonizedby fish communities during the dam removal period butthe communities were similar in total species richnessand Shannon diversity before and after dam removal, andwere similar to a nearby reference site (Salt Creek estuary).Select fish species, including ESA-listed Pacific salmon and trout Oncorhynchus spp., and eulachon Thaleichthys pacificus,and non-native, American shad (Alosa sapidissima),ap​peared quickly in these new habitats. Hatchery releasesof Chinook, O. tshawytscha, coho, O. kisutch, and steelhead,O. mykiss (over 3 million total fish annually to thelower river), dominated the Elwha estuary catch from Aprilthrough August of each year before, during, and after damremoval. Chum salmon catch rate, size, and duration ofestuary occupancy declined during and after dam removal.Overall catches of chum salmon fry prior to, during, andafter dam removal were significantly negatively correlatedwith Chinook salmon catches but significantly, and positively,corr​elated with coho salmon. When assessed at theElwha estuary separately, chum abundance was significantlypo​sitively correlated with Chinook, coho, and steelheadabunda​nce. These patterns indicate overlap, and likelyinteracti​on between these respective groups of hatchery andwild fish. Continued hatchery releases may therefore furtherchalleng​e chum salmon recovery and should be consideredwhen planning for watershed recovery."
