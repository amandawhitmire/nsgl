11,Abstract:,"Large numbers of ""Cancer magister"" zoeae were raised at three experimental temperatures in order to document survival and duration of each of the five zoeal instars independently. The results indicate that survival and stage duration are independent of the values for the previous and subsequent stages, that variability among larvae in instar duration increases with temperature, and that the terminal fifth zoeal stage is the most sensitive to temperature stress."
