11,Abstract:,"This manual describes installation, calibration, operation and maintenance procedures for the Model SW-1D wavemeter, an improved version of Model SW-1C now in use at seven Coast Guard stations along the Washington/Oregâ€‹on/California coasts. The wavemeter infers the height and period of nearshore ocean waves from seismic motions. Outputs include both analog and digital height and period plus output for cable TV and the National Weather Service Device for Automatic Remote Data Collection (DARDC)."
