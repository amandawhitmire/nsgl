15,Abstract:,"Here researchers describe the cloning, expression, sequencing, and some properties of recombinant obelin from the bioluminescent marine hydroid ""Obelia geniculata"" and compare those properties to those of obelin from ""O. longissima."" Though the two varieties of obelin are very similar, there are some clear differences between them."
