12,Abstract:,"Consumers face health risks from eating molluscan shellfish products, such as oysters and clams, particularly raw or partially cooked. With the increasing notoriety of shellfish-â€‹related illnesses and even deaths, the shellfish industry has suffered a decline in sales. Some risks associated with raw or partially cooked oysters can be reduced by depuration. This is a process in which oysters are placed in tanks of sterilized, flowing seawater where their natural pumping action purges the animal of gut contents and pathogens. Currently, depuration is not widely practiced in the U.S. In order for depuration to have any significant impact on risk reduction, there must exist adequate economic incentives for the industry to adopt the technology and to offer the potentially safer product to the market. This chapter reports a case study of the potential for oyster depuration in Dixie and Levy Counties, Florida. The focus is on the costs that a processor would likely incur to set up and operate a depuration facility."
