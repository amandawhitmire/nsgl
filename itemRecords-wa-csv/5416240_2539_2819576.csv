10,Abstract:,"Diploid and triploid clams grown in suspended tray culture were examined histologically during the reproductive season of their second year. Most diploids had matured by the end of May and displayed normal gametogenic development in every individual. Triploids did not mature and most had undeveloped gonads. The few triploid females which developed some oocytes by the end of May had abnormal maturation. Triploids were 77% female as judged by the presence of oocytes; another 16% were female-like and may have been intersexes; the sex of 6% could not be identified because there was no sexual differentiationâ€‹. Sex determination in this species, based in the sex ratio in triploids, best fits the model of an X:autosome balance mechanism as exemplified in some insect species."
