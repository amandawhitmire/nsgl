10,Abstract:,"A hydroacoustic data acquisition and digital data analysis system has been designed and constructed at the University of Washington, Seattle, to measure the abundance of pelagic fish. The portable data acquisition unit consists of an echo sounder interfaced to a magnetic tape recorder. The digital data analysis unit incorporates a small computer, a line printer, and various hardware to interface the computer to an echo sounder or a tape player This paper was written to provide a basic operators manual for the hydroacoustic data acquisition and analysis system and to compile various publications relative to its use. General descriptions, instructions for use, and theory of operation are given for each ma]or component of the system. Several methods for the analysis of recorded hydroacoustic data are also included."
