13,Abstract:,"The goal of this guide is to outline and describe the steps needed to conduct a Bayesian analysis in AD Model Builder. Included are general descriptions of Bayesian inference, priors, work how and two built-in MCMC algorithms. We hope that the guide will enable users to take full advantage of the features of ADMB that are built-in, but not well-â€‹documented."
