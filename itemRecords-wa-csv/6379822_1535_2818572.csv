9,Abstract:,"Incidental fisheries mortality is considered one of the primary threats to albatross and petrel populations worldwide. Albatrosses and other seabirds aggregate at vessels to feed on discarded offal and baits. They can become hooked in longline fishing gear and drown, or they can collide with trawl net cables (warps and third wires) causing death or serious injury. In longline fisheries, 12-15 percent of baits can be lost to seabirds, leading to increased costs and fewer fish caught."
