13,Abstract:,"The functions ascribed to wood in estuaries and along coasts are often assumed to parallel those described for rivers and streams. In this paper, the authors update earlier accounts of the scientific knowledge about wood exported from watersheds and highlight the distinct ecological functions of wood in coastal and estuarine environments. They devote particular attention to the role of estuarine wood as habitat for migrating juvenile salmon because of growing interest in placing wood in estuaries as a presumed method for restoring important habitat of at- risk salmon populations."
