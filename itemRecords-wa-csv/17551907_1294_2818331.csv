14,Abstract:,"This study was designed to assess the occurrence and concentrations of a broad range of contaminants ofemerging concern (CECs) from three local estuaries within a large estuarine ecosystem. In addition toeffluent from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), we sampled water and whole-body juvenileChinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus) in estuariesreceiv​ing effluent. We analyzed these matrices for 150 compounds, which included pharmaceuticals​,personal care products (PPCPs), and several industrial compounds. Collectively, we detected 81analytes in effluent, 25 analytes in estuary water, and 42 analytes in fish tissue. A number of compounds,inclu​ding sertraline, triclosan, estrone, fluoxetine, metformin, and nonylphenol were detected in waterand tissue at concentrations that may cause adverse effects in fish. Interestingly, 29 CEC analytes weredetected in effluent and fish tissue, but not in estuarine waters, indicating a high potential for bioaccumulation​for these compounds. Although concentrations of most detected analytes were present atrelatively low concentrations, our analysis revealed that overall CEC inputs to each estuary amount toseveral kilograms of these compounds per day. This study is unique because we report on CEC concentrationsi​n estuarine waters and whole-body fish, which are both uncommon in the literature. Anoteworthy finding was the preferential bioaccumulation of CECs in free-ranging juvenile Chinooksalmon relative to staghorn sculpin, a benthic species with relatively high site fidelity."
