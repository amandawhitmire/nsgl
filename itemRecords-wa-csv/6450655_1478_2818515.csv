11,Abstract:,"Shadow of the Salmon is written from a traditional cultural perspective to enable students and teachers to learn about an assortment of environmental issues of concern to tribal communities. Native cultural elements permeate the film and the resource guide, and students will learn-from the tribal point of view-the importance of caring for, respecting and living in harmony with Mother Earth. For thousands of generations, the indigenous people of this land have understood that they are part of what is now commonly referred to as the ecological system. They have understood that the watersheds are our homes, and that the gifts of Nature must be respected. It is fundamental to quality education for all children to experience this wisdom, and to learn to celebrate life in all its various forms. Based on the tried and true lessons of the past, we can all take a wiser course of action in the future. Shadow of the Salmon also acknowledges the great importance of team spirit in protecting and restoring salmon and the health of our watersheds. Clearly, the path to these critical objectives is one we must travel together. Tribal and non-tribal communities must learn, work, and celebrate together. Our greatest environmental successes and achievements in the last quarter century have come about through respectful collaboration. Such collaboration requires understanding."
