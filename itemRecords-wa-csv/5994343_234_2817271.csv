21,Notes:,"Final Report to the NOAA Science Advisory Board by the Social Science Review Panel, 18 March 2003, Washington, DC."
22,Abstract:,"The mission of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is to describe and predict changes in the Earth's environment, and conserve and manage wisely the Nation's coastal and marine resources to ensure sustainable economic opportunities. The NOAA Science Advisory Board (SAB), in recognition of the critical role of humans in achieving NOAAs mission, requested that an External Review Panel be formed to evaluate the adequacy of NOAA's social science in understanding the human dimensions of sustainability.â€‹ In its 18 month effort the Panel reviewed a large amount of information representing research, data, staffing, budgets, education, and management philosophies within the five line offices and the Office of the Chief Economist of NOAA. It conducted extensive interviews of the Assistant Administrators and the NOAA Chief Economist."
