9,Abstract:,"Washington is the nation’s leading producer of farmed bivalve shellfish, producing about 40,000 metric tons valued at more than $100 million annually. At the same time, the Puget Sound region is developing rapidly, with an anticipated expansion to a population of 5.3 million by 2025. Friction between shoreline residents and shellfish growers has grown in recent years and assessment of the regional carrying capacity could inform difficult management decisions. The goal of this project is therefore to provide tools and information that assess the ecological and social capacity of south Puget Sound to support shellfish aquaculture."
