7,Abstract:,"The 2018-2022 WSG Strategic Plan represents a balanced and realistic approach to investing in research, outreach, education, communications and partnerships. It builds on existing capabilities to address unique challenges and opportunities at the university, community, state, regional and national levels. Through the strategic planning processes at the national and state level, four critical program areas were identified for WSG for 2018-2022. These critical program areas respond to issues of major importance to WSG constituents and partners, including NOAA, the National Sea Grant Office, research scientists and WSG stakeholders throughout the Pacific Northwest. They also reflect ongoing WSG programs and the expertise of WSG specialists and are directly aligned with focus areas identified in the NOAA National Sea Grant College Program 2018-2021 Strategic Plan. In developing this strategic plan, WSG relied heavily on information provided by its staff, advisory committee, researchers and constituents. More than 450 respondents to an online survey provided feedback. The advisory committee, staff and researchers met over a six-month period to review the planning process and recommend program priorities and implementation strategies."
