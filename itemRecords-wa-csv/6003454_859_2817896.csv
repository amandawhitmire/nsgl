12,Abstract:,"The red alga ""Porphyra"" (nori) is utilized by humans as a food source throughout the world. In 1992, approximately 15 billion sheets (approximately 45,000 dry metric tons) of ""Porphyra"" were produced with an annual value of $1.8 billion (Jensen, 1993). The consumption of nori, long prized by the Japanese, Chinese, Koreans and other people of Asia and the western Pacific as a complement to rice, sushi, soups and salads. Additionally, nori is a staple in macrobiotic diets (Mumford and Miura, 1988), is a source of taurine which controls blood cholesterol levels and a valuable source of phycoerythrin, a red pigment used in the medical diagnostic industry. The consumption of nori in the United States was wholly dependent upon importation from Japan, Korea and China prior to Coastal Plantations International entering the market. Commercial Cultivation of the red alga ""Porphyra yezoensis"" (nori) was initiated in Cobscook and South Bays, Maine in 1991 by Coastal Plantations International, Inc. (CPI) (Levine and Crawford, 1997; Yarish et al., 1996a,b, 1997). CPI's attempt to cultivate nori in the country's northeastern coastal waters follows Washington State's efforts of the 1980s. The transfer and modification of Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Washington State's nori cultivation and processing technologies to Maine has resulted in the world's first internationally certified, organically cultivated and processed nori in addition to the establishment of a nori:finfish integrated polyculture system. The development of CPI has resulted in the formation of two divisions. The Maine Nori Company represents CPI's effort to produce and market organic nori and develop new products and marketing strategies for nori in North America and beyond. PhycoGen, a biotechnology research and product development effort whose goals are to produce new industrial products and drugs through the development of transgenics, natural product discovery, site directed mutagenesis, phycoremediatio​n, and genetic transformations via protoplast fusions. The following applications are representative selections of pending and future aquatic biotechnology projects: natural sunscreen, nori pigments, phycoremediatio​n, edible vaccines, and a sugar substitute."
