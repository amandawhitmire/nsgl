13,Abstract:,"At the first meeting of the UJNR Diving Physiology and Technology Panel in Tokyo, October 11 and 12, 1972, an agreement was reached in principle to exchange information and promote cooperative research. However, no mechanisms existed for actually implementing the agreement. A cooperative research mechanism developed surprisingly quickly because of two energetic, dynamic, and diligent principals. The Diving Physiology and Technology Panel agreed to put their emphases in areas of saturation diving, marine resources development, caisson work, fishing industry, and basic medical sciences. The Panel became the most active and productive among the 16 UJNR panels. Areas of cooperative effort have expanded since 1991 to include deep-sea research."
