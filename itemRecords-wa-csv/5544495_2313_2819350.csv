10,Abstract:,"The structure of the teleost endocrine pancreas is unique in its tendency to form either a large accumulation of islet tissue (principle islet), or a similar accumulation surrounded by a rim of exocrine tissue (Brockmann body). This morphological peculiarity constitutes a valuable model for investigation of islet hormones and their interactions. Understanding of the functional and molecular characteristics of the fish pancreas formerly was slowed by the unavailability of purified piscine islet hormones. Experiments on the endocrine pancreas of salmon, ""Oncorhynchus"" sp., reviewed here, can serve as an example of the advantages of using a teleost fish in studies of vertebrate pancreatic physiology and biochemistry."
