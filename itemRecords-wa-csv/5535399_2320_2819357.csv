17,Abstract:,"Topographic features of a hardbottom nature are common on the Louisiana-​Mississippi-​Alabama-​northwest Florida (L'MAFLA) shelf. They range from low-relief (less than 2#m) northwest-​trending linear ridges constructed of sand and shell gravel and occasional rock rubble to isolated outcrops or erosional remnants of indurated material on the inner shelf to low to high (up to 15-18#m) relief patch reefs, linear ridges and pinnacles on the outer shelf and shelf-break. These hardbottom features provide substrate for sessile epifauna not ordinarily found on the more extensive areas of unconsolidated sediment on the L'MAFLA shelf. This paper briefly describes the geology and biology of these environments."
