10,Abstract:,"Best Management Practices (BMPs) were never intended as cure-alls for the pollution ills plaguing moorage facilities. They are meant to be recommended approaches, and to serve as guidelines for making marinas and boat operations more environmentally compatible. BMPs should be introduced as a component of a comprehensive and planned approach to eliminating pollution. They should be balanced with education aimed at enhancing staff and boater awareness of the impact of spills on the environment, and of the financial consequences of spills. BMPs when viewed as common sense guidelines, and tailored to fit your specific operations, can provide a safer spill-free marina. However, they can not be casually adopted into marina rules without careful planning and possibly legal consultation."
