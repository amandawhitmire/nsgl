12,Abstract:,"Beta-glucanases are prominent proteins in pea endocarp tissue responding to fungal infection. This paper reports on the isolation and sequencing of a partial cDNA clone and a genomic clone for a beta-​1,3-​glucanase from pea. The cDNA probe was further used to examine mRNA accumulation in fungus or chitosan- treated pea pods and seedlings."
