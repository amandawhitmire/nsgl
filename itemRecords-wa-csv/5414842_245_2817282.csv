14,Abstract:,This booklet begins with an overview of the insurance business and descriptions of various ways to organize insurance groups. Then it describes some of the self-insurance groups now operated by fishermen and their organizations in the U.S. and some that are still in the organizational stage. This book is a good general guide to problems encountered by those who decide on self-insurance as an alternative to commercially available policies.
