9,Abstract:,"Puget Sound is central to Washington's heritage, culture and quality of life, contributing billions of dollars to the state's economy. The Sound's social and environmental importance is tied directly to its well-being and the richness and diversity of its natural resources. Unfortunately, many Sound species and habitats are threatened and others are in serious decline. By 2020, the regional population is expected to grow almost 40 percent, to more than 5 million residents. Such rapid growth will put increased pressure on the Sound and, without action now, will jeopardize its future. Based at the University of Washington, Washington Sea Grant (WSG) offers scientific and out- reach expertise to support the protection and restoration of Puget Sound. WSG serves the state and the region by providing technical assistance to marine resource users and managers, engaging the public in activities that promote ecosystem health, and funding vital Puget Sound research. WSG is funded through a state-federal partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."
