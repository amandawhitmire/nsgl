10,Abstract:,"Recent shifts in collection activity and intensity has elicited concern over nongame marine invertebrate (NGMI) harvest from environmental, agency, private and educational quarters. Except for species classified as foodfish or shellfish all other invertebrates are nonclassified and under Washington Department of Wildlife (WDW) jurisdiction as NGMI. Currently, the harvest of these species is uncontrolled. Harvest pressure on many NGMI species has increased. Expansion of the unregulated harvest of these organisms coupled with increasing disturbance of the intertidal communities by public foot traffic may influence the distribution and abundance of species and decrease the value of Puget Sound tidelands as a recreational, educational, research and commercial resource. Removal of species by collectors, and inter-species effects of removal, also may alter natural communities. The information provided in this study will be useful in identifying those species in greatest need of harvest management, designing managerial strategies to balance recreational and commercial demands upon the NGMI resource, identifying harvester groups (ethnic, organizational, and institutional) with special needs which must be considered for effective future managerial or educational programs, and monitoring changes in NGMI populations on Puget Sound beaches."
