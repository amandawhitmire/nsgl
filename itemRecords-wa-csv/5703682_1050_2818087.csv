11,Abstract:,"The process by which resource management is conducted affects its equity, effectiveness, and efficiency. This paper focuses on management efficiency, and the role played by user participation in lowering management costs. User participation contributes positively to the cost- effectiveness of management processes when it lowers costs of information gathering, coordination, monitoring and enforcement, and thus should be incorporated into the management process before resource conditions decline irreversibly."
