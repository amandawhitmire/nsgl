13,Abstract:,"Because of their importance, Pacific salmon have probably been studied more than any other fishes. Thirty years ago there was already a vast literature on salmonids. There is even more today. Most of the studies, however, concern the freshwater phase of salmonid life histories and biology. This book addresses questions concerning the ecology of Pacific salmonids at sea, relevant to all seven anadromous species of ""Oncorhynchus"" (five salmon and two trout) found in the northeastern Pacific. The focus is on processes that affect growth and survival in the ocean, as the author attempts to establish a connection between salmonid ecology and the physical and biological oceanography of that Pacific region. The first chapter, on phylogeny and anadromy of salmonids, covers freshwater and marine life histories. Then the organization of the book follows the sequence of salmonid migrations into the ocean: the timing of outmigration, the importance of estuaries, and survival in fresh and marine waters. The final chapter describes salmonid migrations in both coastal and oceanic waters, and possible guidance mechanisms."
