11,Abstract:,"Normally, the pea mounts a successful resistance response against the bean fungus ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli"", a response characterized by the increased synthesis and accumulation of specific mRNAs and by the appearance of new proteins as measured by 2-D PAGE methods. While the fungal macroconidia do germinate, further growth is arrested. Previous work has shown that a non- lethal heat shock of 40 degrees C administered to pod tissue for 2 h will enable this fungus to grow prolifically throughout pea tissue, and affect the protein pattern seen on 2-D polyacrylamide gels. Under several conditions the pea tissue is able to resist the fungus despite a heat shock; once resistance is established even a major re-direction of cell activities by heat shock will not break the response. Here the relative presence or absence of resistance-â€‹associated mRNA after various heat treatment and recovery periods is correlated to the peas resistance or susceptibility to the bean pathogen."
