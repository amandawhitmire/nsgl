10,Abstract:,"In June-July 1982 and November 1983, studies were carried out of the vertical structure of the Kuroshio Extension along 167 deg E and the path of the current as it approached the Emperor Seamount chain; in addition, records from moored current meters at three locations (two at 167 deg E and one in the Main Gap of the Emperor Seamount chain) were obtained. Results of the current meter data and geostrophic transport calculations, based on the hydrographic measurements made during mooring deployment and retrieval cruises, are discussed. Comparisons are made with the data from the more extensive (both in space and time) mooring array deployed along 152 deg E."
