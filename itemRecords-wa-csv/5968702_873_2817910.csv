10,Abstract:,"This curriculum guide describes a number of activities to help students identify sources of waterborne waste - from soaps, detergents, and household cleaners to hair care products, hand lotions, and toilet paper. This unit will help them recognize our finite water resource and how it is consumed and recycled. Students will also be challenged to identify the various components of home on-site sewage systems and considerably larger sewage treatment facilities. Although the curriculum is geared for the fourth grade classroom environment, the activities can be easily modified for use in middle and high school classrooms. The objectives identified in each activity are linked to specific Essential Academic Learning Requirements in Washington."
