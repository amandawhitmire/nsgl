13,Abstract:,"The authors of this study cloned a suite of 12 microsatellite markers from quillback rockfish, ""Sebastes maliger"", and tested them on quillbacks as well as representatives of 10 other species of ""Sebastes"" and one related genus (""Helicolenus"")​. Six of the loci are polymorphic in quillbacks, and all amplify in at least a majority of species tested. These microsatellite primers should prove to be useful tools for examining species identification, population genetics, hybridization, paternity, kinship, and microsatellite evolution."
