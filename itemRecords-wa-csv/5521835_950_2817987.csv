12,Abstract:,"The carbamate insecticide Sevin (carbaryl) has been sprayed for over 25 years on tideflats of Oregon (until 1984 when use was banned) and the estuaries of Washington to kill ghost shrimp and mud shrimp that, at high densities, adversely impact survival and growth of oysters. Juvenile Dungeness crabs settle from the water column onto tideflats in early summer and may be present at high densities when the chemical is sprayed. Virtually 100% of these small crabs die when sprayed; in addition, older and larger crabs move up onto tideflats with the tide, and feed extensively on dead, contaminated organisms (which further contributes to crab mortality). The change in habitat caused by elimination of shrimp communities and replacement with oysters at high densities is far superior for small crab and some other animal species. The net loss/gain to crab populations when mortality caused by Sevin is balanced against improved shell habitat for several years before harvest is currently being calculated. Controversy pits Washington's richest molluscan aquaculture industry (oyster) against its richest crustacean fishery (crab), yet the practice may be compatible to both interests."
