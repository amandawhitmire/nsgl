12,Abstract:,"This workshop and the NWIFC Marine Resource Resilience project were supported by a grant through the BIA Tribal Resilience Program (Grant A19AP00098). We would like to thank Adaptation International for their support in drafting the technical summaries provided to the workshop participants. T​ommy Moore provided an overview of what Scenario Planning is and what the goals of the workshop are. Scenario planning is a process for looking at uncertain futures, how they might come to be, and what we need to do to prepare for them. Going through this process can have the added benefit of gaining experience in long-term planning in the face of uncertainty (as opposed to reacting as things happen). The workshop goals were developed through calls and surveys with tribal technical staff and invited experts. The goals were: • Increased knowledge of marine climate change • Experience in long-term planning for an uncertain future • Discussion around priority marine resources and primary threats they face • A workshop report that will provide support for adaptation planning and for securing additional funding • Development of technical summaries for policy makers, fishermen and community members following the workshop • Development of tribal and county level information following the workshop."
