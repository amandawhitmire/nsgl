11,Abstract:,"Effectors reported to enhance plant defense responses, inhibitors of vital cell processes and RNAi silencing oligomers constructed to block the accumulation of HMG-I/Y a transcription factor, were employed to investigate the non-host resistance response in peas to ""Fusarium solani"" f.sp. phaseoli. The effectors; salicylate, BTH, jasmonic acid, catechol, superoxide- and nitric oxide-​generating compounds did not enhance pisatin accumulations or disease resistance when applied singly. Phosphatase and kinase inhibitors were potent: elicitors of pisatin, whereas, inhibitors of topoisomerases, histone deacetylation, protease, nuclease, protein synthesis, and programmed cell death did not elicit. Distamycin A, with a potential to compete with the architectural transcription factor HMG- I/Y for AT-rich DNA, was an elicitor. The partial identification of a Fusarium-​produced phosphatase inhibitor will be discussed."
