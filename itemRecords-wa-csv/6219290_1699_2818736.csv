11,Abstract:,"Progress with respect to federal regulation of offshore marine aquaculture in the U.S. EEZ is slow. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) funded a regional open ocean aquaculture initiative for New England in Fiscal Year 1998, and regional fishery management councils have begun to incorporate aquaculture provisions in their fishery management plans. However, this may not be the most desirable approach to developing a regulatory framework for offshore aquaculture in federal waters. A window of opportunity for addressing the issues discussed in this paper was missed in the most recent reauthorization of the National Aquaculture Act (June 1998), which made no modifications to the existing federal approach. However, funding for marine aquaculture is included in the Clinton Administration'​s National Oceans Initiative, announced in June 1998. If enacted, the proposal will provide $3 million annually over a 3-year period beginning in fiscal year 2000. Adoption of JSA's draft National Aquaculture Development Plan could serve as a vehicle for promoting needed change in the legal and regulatory framework for offshore aquaculture and devising a federal policy for leasing federal waters in the EEZ."
