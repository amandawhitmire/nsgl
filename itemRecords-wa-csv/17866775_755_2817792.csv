18,Abstract:,"This report provides a collective view of 2015 Puget Sound marine water quality and conditions and associated biota from comprehensive monitoring and observing programs. While the report focuses on the marine waters of greater Puget Sound, additional selected conditions are also included due to their influence on Puget Sound waters. These include largescale climate indices and conditions along the outer Washington coast. It is important to document and understand regional drivers of variability and patterns on various timescales so that water quality data may be interpreted with these variations in mind, to better attribute human effects versus natural variations and change. This is the fifth annual report produced for the PSEMP Marine Waters Workgroup. Our message to decision makers, policy makers, managers, scientists, and the public who are interested in the health of Puget Sound follows."
