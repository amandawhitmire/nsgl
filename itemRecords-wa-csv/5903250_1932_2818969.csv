14,Abstract:,"Mn2+ is capable of stimulating photoprotein luminescence, though to lower maximum levels than Ca2+. Some evidence suggests that Mn2+ binds to only one of the three sites that Ca2+ acts upon. To establish which of the three sites binds Mn2+, researchers examined the effects of Mn2+ on wild-type obelin and on two sets of obelin mutants in which the individual Ca2+-binding sites had been disabled in different ways."
