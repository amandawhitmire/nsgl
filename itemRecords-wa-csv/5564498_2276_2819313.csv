11,Abstract:,"Peptides, without question, are among the most fascinating chemical materials, for they contribute to most life processes. Perhaps one of the most studied molecules ever, and the only peptide commercialized on a large scale, is the synthetic sweetener aspartame. Biomedical or other commercializati​on of new peptides for human use no doubt will be accompanied by much necessary study, debate, and caution, and thus introduction of these materials may be delayed. However, industrial and agricultural applications can be found for many peptides and polypeptides-​-​including anticrystalliza​tion agents, dispersants, and other polyelectrolyte materials; peptide growth substances for animals; and peptide antibiotics-​-​and these may be more readily available for commercializati​on. The 25 chapters of this book cover these and other novel peptides, as well as the more traditional polymers, and the authors come from both academia and industry. Overall, the book promotes the use of peptides and polyamino acids in a variety of settings. An advantage of these materials is that they generally are nontoxic and biodegradable. Consequently, the book is intended not only as a source of information for scientists and engineers in industry, academia, the military, but also as evidence that environmentally compatible alternative materials are being developed for a number of applications."
