9,Abstract:,"As increasing numbers of salmon stocks are listed under the Endangered Species Act, the economic costs of protection and recovery will begin to play a larger role in salmon conservation policy. In the northwestern U.S., recovering endangered Snake River salmon will require modifying public land use, restricting fishing and hatchery production, reducing water for agriculture, and altering the operation of hydroelectric dams. The author of this paper discusses the nonuse value of salmon recovery, and the need for better economic and biological information to assure that decisions for species protection are reasonably cost effective."
