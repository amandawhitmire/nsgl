9,Abstract:,"A diverse community of marine organisms, seagrasses and thalloid algae inhabit the lagoon where mullet and shrimp used to be fished commercially. Polychaetes are an integral component of soft sediment and coral rock communities in this tropical ecosystem and a qualitative assessment of the species found in the lagoon and from the lush coral reefs nearby may be useful to ecologists, fisheries biologists, and zoogeographers. This paper includes a discussion of the Serpulidae and Spirorbidae, descriptions of a new species and an inventory of the remaining 17 families. Ecological and zoogeographical information are discussed for the calcareous tubeworms, and affinities with other west Pacific areas are tabulated. The serpulids show the closest affinities with southern Japan, and the spirorbids with Fiji and east Australia. These findings reflect sampling effort so a true picture of zoogeographical relationships is not possible at this time."
