10,Abstract:,"The implementation of EcoWin (see e.g. Ferreira et al., 2008; Nobre et al., 2010; Nunes et al., 2011; Ferreira et al., 2014, for application in various parts of the world) involves a set of stages, which include (i) adaptation and if necessary development of biogeochemical and physiological process equations; (ii) spatial definition of the modeling domain; and (iii) coupling to hydrological and hydrodynamic models."
