10,Abstract:,"The purpose of the workshop was to explore the potential for greater collaboration between national estuary, coastal management, and related programs of the U.S. This was considered an important question because of heightened interest in coastal water quality issues, and because of the complementary nature of the programs. For example, there is the potential for the land use control capabilites of coastal management to be a tool for achieving some of the water quality and resource protection goals established in the estuary programs. Further, recent changes in federal law have given coastal management programs new responsibilitie​s for protecting coastal water quality. Workshop participants were chosen by a steering committee and selected based on expertise, geographic diversity, and role in coast and estuary management issues; they included federal officials, coast/estuary program managers, state and local government officials, researchers, and other representing interest groups, tribes and related agency experts."
