11,Abstract:,Work has been under way for more than two years in the development of an acoustical integrator as part of the University of Washington program under the National Sea Grant College Act. A technical description of the integrator and necessary calibration tests have been discussed in two previous circulars. The present report contains some additional calibration studies but also results of t' he first practical application of the integrator in the enumeration of the stock of pre-smolt sockeye salmon in Lake Washington.
