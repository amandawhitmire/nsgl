11,Abstract:,"Gamete quality has become a focus in aquaculture due to its impacts on fertilization success and larval survival. Computer-​assisted sperm analysis (CASA), initially developed for mammals, is a rapid quantitative method to assess sperm quality by recording and measuring velocity and trajectory. To date, CASA has been applied to fish and shellfish for sperm quality analysis in 26 species in 33 published studies (Table 1). Most studies focused on sperm motility changes after cryopreservatio​n, or after exposure to certain agents such as toxic chemicals or hormones. The species studied were mostly aquaculture fishes such as catfish, carp, flounder, and trout. Different from that of mammals, fish sperm usually swim for seconds to minutes after activation, and motility gradually decreases. Therefore, extreme care should be used when setting up the parameter profiles in CASA systems, especially the timing for initiation of image capture."
