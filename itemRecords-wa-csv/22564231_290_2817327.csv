11,Abstract:,"June 2019: It’s difficult to believe, but Washington Sea Grant Crab Team has officially launched our fifth year of monitoring. It’s easy for us to reflect on the number of green crab, monitoring sites and traps we’ve set, and feel pretty good about what we’ve been able to accomplish. But we’re even prouder of the network of collaborators that has bloomed since Crab Team’s first traps hit the water. November, 2019: We’re often asked if you can eat green crabs, and whether that is a key to managing them. Green crabs are edible, but thankfully, we don’t currently have anywhere near the number of crabs on inland shorelines that would sustain a fishery, and we hope to keep it that way. On the U.S. East Coast, folks are working very hard to make a market for the species as a way to reduce their ecological impacts. Because every invasion is different, for the current situation in the Salish Sea, our recipe for success could have different ingredients."
