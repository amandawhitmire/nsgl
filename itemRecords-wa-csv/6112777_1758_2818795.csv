8,,"Environmental Best Management Practices (BMPs) are those practices selected by a systematic process and judged as good, exemplary or successfully demonstrated to reduce negative impacts on the environment. ""Best"" is a contextual term. Those practices adopted by your tourism business will depend on what stage of development you are in, as well as your executive commitment. This commitment presumes a willingness to strive for a level of performance that exceeds basic regulatory compliance requirements or common standards of practice. The marine tourism BMPs apply to marine tourism subsectors such as kayaking, diving, pleasure tour vessels, whale watching operations, cruise ships, marinas, and charter fishing."
