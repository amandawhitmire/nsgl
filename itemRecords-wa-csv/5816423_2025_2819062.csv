12,Abstract:,"A principal component analysis reveals that Pacific salmon catches in Alaska have varied inversely with catches from the U. S. West Coast during the past 70 years. If variations in catch reflect variations in salmon production, then these results suggest that the spatial and temporal characteristics of this inverse catch/productio​n pattern are related to climate forcing associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a recurring pattern of pan- Pacific atmosphere-​ocean variability. Temporally, both the physical and biological variability are best characterized as alternating 20 to 30-year-long regimes punctuated by abrupt reversals. From 1977 to the early 1990s, ocean conditions have generally favored Alaska stocks and disfavored West Coast stocks. Unfavorable ocean conditions are likely confounding management efforts focused on increasing West Coast Pacific salmon production. Recovery of at-risk stocks may await the next reversal of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation."
