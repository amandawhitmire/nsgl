8,Abstract:,"Coinciding with the call for a more comprehensive approach to ocean management in the U.S. was the call for reform in the prevailing balance of powers between state and federal levels of government. Given the hopes and fears generated by the new federalism among different public interest groups, it is important to attempt to analyze the wisdom of establishing, as the Administration proposes, a balance of powers more favorable to the states. This article suggests that before one advocates a shift of responsibilitie​s, the objectives and strengths of government at each level be considered in relation to the specific policy arena at hand. To lay the groundwork for deep inquiry into the overarching question of federalism in the EEZ, this article focuses on one policy area--vessel source pollution regulation."
