16,Abstract:,"This symposium was the first oppportunity for North Pacific flatfish scientists to share information internationally​. Flatfish are a major part of the ecosystem, but because they do not bring in big dollars on the fisheries market, they are often an ignored resource. The symposium gave scientists a perspective for ecosystem research planning. Thirty-five papers present research results on flatfish spawning habits, latitudinal patterns, feeding, energy needs, morphological variation, habitat, population dynamics, health and condition, bycatch, management, and the recreational fishery."
