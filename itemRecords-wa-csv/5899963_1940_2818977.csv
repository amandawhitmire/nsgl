12,Abstract:,"In this study, scientists followed changes in archaeal diversity in hydrothermal fluids from a single vent over a 3-year period. Diffuse, low-temperature hydrothermal fluids show marked variations in thermal and chemical characteristics over periods of years due to the evolution of hydrothermal systems and over minutes to hours due to changes in the degree of mixing with seawater and tidal cycles. In an effort to understand how these variations affect the microbial communities, they performed molecular phylogenetic and chemical analyses on diffuse-flow vent fluids from one site following the January 1998 Axial Seamount eruption and again in 1999 and 2000."
