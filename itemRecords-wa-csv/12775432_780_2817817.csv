10,Abstract:,"The purpose of this project is to develop and refine a technique for taking photographs to be included in an atlas of the foraminifera of Puget Sound. Foraminifera are a critical component at the bottom of the marine food chain, and this will be the first comprehensive compilation of foraminifera species in Puget Sound. The atlas will contain photographs and detailed descriptions of each foraminifera species."
