9,Abstract:,"Commercial shellfish aquaculture became important in Washington State in the mid-1800s. Today, Washington State is the largest producer of farmed bivalves in the United States, grossing $96.95 million in 2005. However, acidification of seawater caused by anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) threatens to reduce shellfish growth rates, thereby altering profit margins and reducing the resilience of the industry. At the same time, harvest closures caused by harmful algal blooms (HABs) are likely to increase with warming water temperatures, eutrophication, and changing ocean chemistry. I propose that if bivalve aquaculture in Puget Sound becomes unprofitable due to changes in seawater chemistry and regional warming, the value of shellfish could shift from an ecosystem good (marketable shellfish) to an ecosystem service (water filtration capacity). The history of shellfish in the Chesapeake Bay and recent research in shellfish biology offer insights into management strategies that could be applied in Puget Sound to enhance the resilience of the local aquaculture industry. Strategic management decisions may help to guide the transformation of the aquaculture industry, prolonging its economic profitability in the face of exogenous forces such as changing ocean chemistry and a warming climate."
