10,Abstract:,"Don't dump live aquarium pets or animals! Releasing aquarium plants and pets into the wild isn't good for your plants and pets and is sometimes illegal. It can also hurt the environment, including the animals already living in marine waters or the lakes or streams near you. This passout describes what you can do instead, and why."
