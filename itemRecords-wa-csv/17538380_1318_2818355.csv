14,Abstract:,"Although it is recognized that marine wild-capture fisheries are an important source of foodfor much of the world, the cost of sustainable capture fisheries to species diversity is uncertain, and it isoften questioned whether industrial fisheries can be managed sustainably. We evaluated the trade-off amongsustainable food production, profitability, and conservation objectives in the groundfish bottom-trawl fisheryoff the U.S. West Coast, where depletion (i.e., reduction in abundance) of six rockfish species (Sebastes) is ofparticular concern. Trade-offs are inherent in this multispecies fishery because there is limited capacity totarget species individually. From population models and catch of 34 stocks of bottom fish, we calculated therelation between harvest rate, long-term yield (i.e., total weight of fish caught), profit, and depletion of eachspecies. In our models, annual ecosystem-wide yield from all 34 stocks was maximized with an overall 5.4%harvest rate, but profit was maximized at a 2.8% harvest rate. When we reduced harvest rates to the level(2.2% harvest rate) at which no stocks collapsed (<10% of unfished levels), biomass harvested was 76% of themaximum sustainable yield and profit 89% of maximum. A harvest rate under which no stocks fell below thebiomass that produced maximum sustainable yield (1% harvest rate), resulted in 45% of potential yield and67% of potential profit. Major reductions in catch in the late 1990s led to increase in the biomass of the mostdepleted stocks, but this rebuilding resulted in the loss of>30% of total sustainable yield, whereas yield lostfrom stock depletion was 3% of total sustainable yield. There are clear conservation benefits to lower harvestrates, but avoiding overfishing of all stocks in a multispecies fishery carries a substantial cost in terms oflost yield and profit"
