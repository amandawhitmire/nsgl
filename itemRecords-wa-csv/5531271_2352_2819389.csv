11,Abstract:,"Saponins are a group of natural products found in at least 500 genera of plants. Reportedly, saponins inhibit fungal growth by forming complexes with sterols in the plasma membrane. This study examined possible associations between pea saponins, chitosan, and disease resistance in the pea-""F. solani"" interaction. Native pea saponins were isolated, partially characterized, and tested for antifungal activity. The effect of the isolated saponins in in-vivo and in-vitro synthesis of chitin and chitosan in ""F. solani"" was evaluated."
