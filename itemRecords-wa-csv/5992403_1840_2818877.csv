11,Abstract:,"The application of an evolution-based path planner for a UAV in long-range flight through realistic wind fields is presented. The planner makes use of wind information obtained from actual weather databases. Horizontal wind variability in both 3-D space and time is taken into account for the planning of the complete path. Two additional features in the planner include a spherical Earth geometry for path generation and a UAV performance and fuel consumption model. The objective of the planner is to reduce fuel requirements for the entire flight. The planner is capable of making in-flight modifications to further refine or adapt its path to updated wind information. Simulation results for a flight from Honolulu, HI to Long Beach, WA with an Aerosonde aircraft are presented."
