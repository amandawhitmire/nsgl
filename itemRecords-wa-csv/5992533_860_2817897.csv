9,Abstract:,"Although some literature suggests that the function of riverine and estuarine large woody debris (LWD) is similar in systems used by juvenile salmon, scientific evidence is either lacking or insubstantial. Ecological roles of LWD for support of juvenile salmon were explored in natural and created oligohaline-​brackish estuarine sloughs on the Chehalis River, Washington, USA. Relationships were examined between LWD and migrating juvenile chum and chinook salmon (""Oncorhynchus keta,"" ""O. tschawytscha"") and LWS and invertebrates. Sediment characteristics related to LWD and spatial dynamics (movement; complexity as determined by Area:perimeter ratios) of LWD were investigated. Results suggest that LWD in estuarine sloughs is not a major factor supporting juvenile salmon, prey times, or unique invertebrate groups. Fish densities did not relate to wood surface area of total fish or salmonids. Invertebrate density differences in Near- and Away-from LWD areas (Near=within 0.25 m, Away=further than >2m) were not observed, nor were there major differences in invertebrate assemblages. LWD-surfaces contained proportionally more isopods, chironomid larvae, tanaids, and bivalves and less polychaetes compared to benthic sediments. Sediment deposition rates, grain sizes, and organic content in Near- and Away-from LWD areas did not differ. Wood abundance did not change considerably and a small proportion of LWD moved over the seven-year time interval. Wood type, slough, and bank location did not determine LWD complexity change, and LWD changes did not differ in the natural vs. created slough. Extrapolation of the role of riverine to estuarine LWD was valid for LWD providing substrate for invertebrates, but not for direct fish habitat or sedimentation. However, uncertainty still exists about estuarine LWD and its direct support of biota, and restoration projects may do well to take into account the cost of considering LWD in the context of project goals. Given widespread reduction of LWD in coastal systems, LWD in estuarine systems should not be discounted for functions promoting habitat quality, especially because the potential importance of LWD on larger scales and in other estuarine areas remains unexplored. Further studies could investigate more areas within estuaries (e.g. marshes), multiple estuarine systems, and other temporal scales."
