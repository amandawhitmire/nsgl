9,Abstract:,"Septic maintenance can extend the life of your septic system, protect water quality and also help protect public health. An inspection of your septic tank by a certified septic professional will give you and your ""pumper"" information about the integrity of your septic tank and indicate whether your tank needs to be pumped. Commercial septic tank additives won't eliminate the need for periodic clean-out. This fact sheet also lists what information should be given to you on a receipt from the pumper."
