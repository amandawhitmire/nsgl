14,Abstract:,"The multi-agency Puget Sound Dredge Disposal Analysis Program has been delegated the task of evaluating, selecting, monitoring and managing sites within the inland waters of Washington State for long-term, unconfined disposal of uncontaminated dredged materials. Seven preliminary disposal sites were identified within five Zones of Siting Feasibility (ZSFs) in central Puget Sound based on 19 selection factors covering physical parameters, human uses and historical biological resource data. This document is the final technical report detailing the results of trawl studies conducted in each of the five ZSFs during 1986, using both a small 3-m research beam trawl and a 7.6-m research 6 m) otter trawl. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. Part I: Crab and shrimp studies. Paul A. Dinnel, David A. Armstrong, and Anthony Wiley pp. 1-50. 2. Part II: Demersal fish studies. Robert F. Donnelly, Bruce S. Miller, Robert R. Lauth, and Shelley C. Clarke pp. 51-88."
