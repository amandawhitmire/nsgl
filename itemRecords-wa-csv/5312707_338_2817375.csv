14,Abstract:,"The Seattle Smoked Fish Conference was conducted in April 1981 in response to the need for a review of practical and technical information pertaining to commercial smoking of fish. The Smoked Fish Manual is a report of this conference. The smoked processes and species dealt with in this report are those associated with the northeastern Pacific Ocean, but this information is equally useful to those operating in other temperate regions of the world. The smoked fish manual contains five major sections of information of interest to the new or established fish smoker: plant design, kiln smoker! design, health regulations, quality control procedures, and smoking procedures. In addition, a bibliography is included for further reference on fish curing and smoking. This manual was compiled from papers presented at the Smoked Fish Conference Seattle Center, April 27-29, 1981."
