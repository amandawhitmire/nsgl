12,Abstract:,"The Sea Grant Colleges Program was created in 1966 to stimulate research, instruction and extension of knowledge of marine resources of the United States. In 1969 the Sea Grant Program was established at the University of Miami. The outstanding success of the Land Grant Colleges Program, which in 100 years has brought the United States to its current superior position in agriculture production, helped initiate the Sea Grant concept. This concept has three primary objectives: to promote excellence in education and training, research and information services in the University's disciplines that relate to the sea. The successful accomplishment of these objectives, it is believed, will result in practical contributions to marine oriented industries and government and will, in addition, protect and preserve the environment for the benefit of all. With these objectives, this series of Sea Grant Special Bulletins is intended to convey useful information to the marine communities interested in resource development. While the responsibility for administration of the Sea Grant Program rests with the Department of Commerce, the responsibility for financing the program is shared by federal, industrial and University of Miami contributions. This paper, The Marine Technician—Past​, Present and Future, was presented at the Marine Technology Society meeting in Washington, D.C., 1971. Because of continued interest shown through the number of requests for copies of this paper, it is published as a part of the Sea Grant Program. ABSTRA​CT - The general origin and role of the technician is discussed. The concept of the Marine Technician evolves from considerations of past practices, community needs, and actions taken to meet these needs. The role of the supporting community is discussed and significant factors for a successful program outlined. Photos are presented to emphasize the need for hands-​on training."
