11,Abstract:,"Washington's recent history in ocean policy development started in 1967 when the state's Oceanographic Commission was established. The commission was disbanded in 1982 when the state's interests in ocean policy were at a low point. This lack of interest changed rapidly after 1986 when a federal OCS lease sale was announced. Since then several new organizations have been created and a 1989 law established preliminary ocean policies for the state. This article provides an account of the participants and organizations that have influenced ocean policy development in Washington, critiques the state's new ocean law, and analyzes organizational issues to be addressed. Washington is among the first states to formulate ocean policy and organizational arrangements. Its experience can provide lessons for other states considering ocean policy development."
