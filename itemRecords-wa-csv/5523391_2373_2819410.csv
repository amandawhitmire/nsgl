12,Abstract:,"Selected morphological traits were documented for megalopae of ""Cancer magister,"" ""C. oregonensis,"" and ""C. productus"" collected at three sites within the Puget Sound basin and at two offshore sites in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Variation in selected traits was compared among species, among individuals within species, and among regions sampled. Results indicate that megalopae of ""C. magister"" can be separated from those of ""C. productus"" and ""C. oregonensis"" by size alone, but that the latter two species cannot be separated with certainty on the basis of features described in the literature as diagnostic. Differences may reflect hydrographic features of the region and the megalopa's site of origin. Variability in morphological traits must be included in any analysis of factors for species identification and may contribute to analysis of broader ecological issues."
