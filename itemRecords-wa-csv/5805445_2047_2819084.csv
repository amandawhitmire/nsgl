14,Abstract:,"""Renibacterium salmoninarum,"" the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease in salmonid fish, produces large quantities of a 57-58 kDa protein (p57) during growth in broth culture and during infection. In this study, researchers report that three agglutination-​inhibiting monclonal antibodies recognize separate non-overlapping epitopes in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and that these epitopes were localized on the amino-terminal portion of p57 by immunoblotting of recombinant fragments of p57. They also found that secreted p57 was present as a monomer in culture supernatant as well as infected fish tissue. The monomer, purified from bacterial culture supernatant, was sufficient for agglutination of rabbit erythrocytes and fish leucocytes in vitro."
