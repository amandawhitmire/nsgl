11,Abstract:,"Several cloned pea genes are activated in correlation with the expression of disease resistance observed in pea pod tissue inoculated with ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli (non-host resistance) or with races of ""Pseudomonas syringae"" pv. ""pisi"" (race-specific resistance). Chitosan, a minor component of the fungal cell wall, is capable of inducing such genes. Some of the same genes were induced in both the non-host and race-specific resistance, suggesting that the single dominant Mendelian traits reportedly involved in race-specific resistance may be involved in the regulation of multiple response genes which are closely associated with the expression of resistance. Proposed mechanisms by which pathogens induce these genes are discussed."
