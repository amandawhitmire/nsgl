9,Abstract:,"During reproductive periods, oysters have reduced marketability and decreased survival. Researchers have sought a genetic means to reduce or eliminate gametogenesis in cultured oysters. Pressure treatments (6000-8000 psi) ten minutes after fertilization for ten minutes' duration consistently produced triploids-​-​effectively neutered oysters. Utilizing flow cytometry techniques, analysis at the larval stage provides reliable estimates of triploid proportions, eliminating several weeks of culture time."
