10,Abstract:,"The Washington/Oreg​on coastal zone is a classical eastern boundary current region. The area is extremely productive, the productivity dependent on near-shore infusions of nutrients into surface layers during wind-driven coastal upwelling. In this respect the area contrasts dramatically with other U.S. coastal regions, such as the California Bight and the southeast continental shelf, where offshore boundary currents rather than coastal wind forcing are primarily responsible for regional characteristics in productivity. The relatively straight coastline and broad, deep shelf greatly simplify the physical environment, so that processes responsible for much of the variance are more easily identified. The system response from mid-Oregon northward, although not strictly two-​dimensional, is more so than many other coastal areas. Consequently, the system is amenable to the testing of relatively simple models integrating wind forcing with physical, chemical and biological responses in the upper water column. This book synthesizes information gathered about these processes and their interactions."
