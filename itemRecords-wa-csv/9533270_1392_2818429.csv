13,Abstract:,"The Molluscan Broodstock Program (MBP) was funded as a special project or earmark through USDA. The program was initiated in 1996 and has focused on improving yields of Pacific oysters through genetic selection. Funding for MBP has ended and efforts have been made to transfer the program to industry. A coordinating committee consisting of industry members, academics and federal agencies was established in 2011 to try to develop a strategy to collectively support the breeding program or, at least, to prevent the loss of genetically improved stocks. This presentation will provide an update on the committeeâ€™s progress and future plans for MBP."
