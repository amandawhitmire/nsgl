14,Abstract:,"The objective of this investigation was to determine if cryopreservatio​n of salmonid sperm can be used successfully under normal field conditions. Sperm was collected from natural/wild steelhead rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) males trapped on two Lochsa River tributaries during the spring of 1987 and frozen in liquid nitrogen. In the spring of 1988 (approximately 11 months later), this frozen sperm was thawed and used to fertilize eggs from Dworshak National Fish Hatchery stock females. Of the 44,676 eggs used from six females, 10,404 embryos developed to the eyed stage and 10,254 hatched."
