10,Abstract:,"Ocean and coastal environments in Washington are critical to our economy, culture and quality of life. Coastal communities have a rich history and share a unique relationship to coastal resources. Yet increasing demands on these resources, including potential new uses for them, create conflicts. In addition, it's important to ensure that ocean and coastal ecosystems remain healthy for future generations to enjoy."
