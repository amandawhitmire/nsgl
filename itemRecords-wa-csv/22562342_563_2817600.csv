11,Abstract:,"Underwater photographer Keith Ellenbogen visited Washington, D.C., to present a series of his visually compelling images from Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, connecting government leaders to the stunning marine wildlife off the Northeast coast of the United States. Keith Ellenbogen, an acclaimed underwater photographer, is an Assistant Professor of Photography at SUNY/Fashion Institute of Technology and a Visiting Artist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sea Grant. He is also a multi-year Ernest F. Hollings Ocean Awareness Award grantee, selected by the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation to capture dramatic images about the extraordinary diversity of marine life within Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, just 25 nautical miles off the coast of Boston. Keith was invited to present images and stories with congressional leaders to raise ocean awareness about local marine life during Capitol Hill Ocean Week (CHOW), which took place June 4-6, 2019. He also did a presentation on September 26, 2019 to the U.S. Senate Oceans Caucus which was hosted by the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation, with honorary co-hosts: Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), co-chairs of the caucus. Keith's presentation here also debuted immersive virtual reality experiences using Virtual Reality headsets, where audience members were able to ""dive"" with the Atlantic river herring during an annual migration as well as a 16 ft., 3,000 lb. great white shark-named Large Marge."
