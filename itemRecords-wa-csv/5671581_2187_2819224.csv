11,,"Small operational oil spills that occur on a daily basis in coastal and estuarine waters may be overlooked in lieu of protecting natural resources from large catastrophic oil releases. Prevention is the most cost-effective means of protecting coastal marine environments from releases of oil and oil products. Emphasis is shifting from required oil spill prevention activities to prevention education as mandated oil spill prevention plans for regulated vessels and facilities are completed. The oil spill prevention triangle was developed in response to a need to address the problem of small oil spills from vessels and facilities of all sizes. The spill triangle provides a powerful conceptual framework and a convenient memory device for the marine vessel/facility operator, within which both the operator and the marine educator can fit more facility operator can analyze her or his own very specific operations to find and formulate improved, less spill-prone procedures. Enabling the operator through presentation of a conceptual framework is the major strength of the oil spill prevention triangle."
