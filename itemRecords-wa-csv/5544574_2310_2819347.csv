13,Abstract:,"The aims of this study were to (1) evaluate the effect of several amino acids injected intraperitoneal​ly on the plasma insulin levels in salmon and to assess which one appears to be the most insulinotropic; (2) formulate a diet supplemented with this particular amino acid; (3) test whether such diet elevates intrinsic plasma insulin levels in fish, and finally (4) investigate whether the fish fed an amino acid-​supplemented diet exhibit an enhanced growth rate. Results showed that arginine supplemented diets had a short-term stimulatory effect on fish growth, an effect which could be detected only in fingerlings."
