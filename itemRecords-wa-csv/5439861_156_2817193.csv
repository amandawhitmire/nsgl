14,Abstract:,"This book contains the summaries of transcripts from a conference attended by insurance underwriters, brokers, safety officials and fishing industry leaders from the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Most workshop sessions consisted of panel presentations followed by an open discussion period. Topics included national and international perspectives on fishing vessel insurance, brokers' views on same, congressional legislation and regulation, and alternative insurance systems. Safety training programs were overviewed, and issues of responsibility were discussed. The final session addressed Sea Grant's advisory role in marine insurance and safety."
