10,Abstract:,"boat, marina"
11,,"Bellingham's Squalicum Harbor, with its year-round fleet of more than sixteen hundred recreational and commercial fishing boats, is the second largest marina in Puget Sound. Like most other marinas, however, it has a problem with the proper disposal of plastic and other wastes that are generated by this fleet. The Washington Sea Grant Program and the Port of Bellingham have been working together to help alleviate the situation at Squalicum Harbor by improving the waste collection facilities and then by educating the boaters and commercial fishermen who use the harbor. This pamphlet describes the problems and solutions, and includes a poster of the harbor's waste disposal sites."
