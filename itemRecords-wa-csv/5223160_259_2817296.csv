10,Abstract:,"There is a growing interest in the study of the early life history of marine fish. The fact that fish eggs and larvae form part of the marine zooplankton ties them closely to the dynamics of this most important component of the marine ecosystem. The connections of the early life history stages to size and composition of the parent stock, and to subsequent recruitment, prompted fishery biologists to study the ichthyoplankton​ in order to monitor trends in single fish stocks and multispecies fish populations and to forecast recruitment for management purposes. The present publication appears some time after the lectures were delivered due to the author's wish to make a very exhaustive review of the literature on the early fife history of fishes from the time of gonadal development to the appearance of a free-swimming larva. For the North American reader this book provides a unique entry to the rich European literature on this phase of the early life history of marine fish."
