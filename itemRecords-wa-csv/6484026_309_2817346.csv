12,Abstract:,"Outreach and education programs can offer innovative and effective approaches for reaching conservation goals. Using specific examples from Washington Sea Grant, the presentation examined diverse outreach and education approaches used in: Building support for scientific research to guide environmental management; Reducing impacts of human activities on the marine environment; Encouraging sustainable marine uses and reduce conflicts; Engaging the public in marine conservation and restoration; and Strengthening ocean literacy and workforce capability. Based at the University of Washington, Washington Sea Grant (WSG) supports research, provides technical assistance, marine education and outreach, and translates university science to serve those who manage and use the Salish Sea. WSG field staff work with the public on practical ways to reduce toxic pollution, restore habitat, promote eco-friendly businesses and reduce impacts on Puget Sound. The presentation will highlight the role of scientific and technical expertise in building successful programs, as well as development of partnerships and engagement of stakeholders. Programs covered will include Sound Science, Bivalves for Clean Water, NOAA Science Camp, and the Boater Pumpout Campaign."
