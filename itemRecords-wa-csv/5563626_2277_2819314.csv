11,Abstract:,"Observations of the porcelain crabs ""Petrolisthes cinctipes"" and ""P. eriomerus"" on the outer coast of Washington State and British Columbia indicated a striking pattern of intertidal zonation in which the two species occupy the mid- to upper and lower intertidal areas, respectively. Gregarious settlement by megalopae of these two species helps to maintain the existing zonation pattern, but fails to explain what restricts the highly motile adults to a particular level. After quantitative sampling to further document the zonation patterns in different areas, a series of laboratory experiments and field manipulations were conducted in an attempt to isolate the factors involved in the establishment of this pattern."
