11,Abstract:,"Interest in the fatty acid requirements of finfish has grown rapidly over the past two decades. Following recently published studies demonstrating the apparent human health benefits of ""n""-3 fatty acids, intense interest in fish as a dietary source of those fatty acids has been generated. Fish oil capsules are available though most consumers continue to prefer the consumption of fish itself. The recent interest in ""n""-3 fatty acids relative to the human diet has undoubtedly sparked renewed research activity concerning the role of lipids in fish nutrition. While most marine species and such coldwater species as rainbow trout have recognized requirements for ""n""-3 fatty acids, this may not be the case for all warmwater fish species. In some studies, fish on fat-free diets actually grew better than those receiving diets supplemented with highly purified fatty acids; however, those studies were rather short-term. This paper reviews current knowledge of the subject and urges further research."
