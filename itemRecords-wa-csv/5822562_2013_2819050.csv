11,Abstract:,"By photographing the movements of dyed density steps, Woods (1968) revealed overturning billows in the shallow oceanic thermocline. Owing to the strong stratification, their amplitudes were only 20 cm. More recently, signatures of 2- 5 m billows have been found in thermistor chain data (e.g. Marmarino, 1990). In spite of these observations, questions remain about the intensity and location of turbulence within the billows because none of the observations the authors are aware of combine visualizations with simultaneous measurements of velocity, density, and turbulence. Here, the authors present observations of 15-20 m billows in a salt-stratified tidal channel. Narrow-beam echo sounders provided the 2-D view necessary for unambiguous identification, and an acoustic Doppler current profiler measured velocities with a vertical resolution of about 10 m. The Advanced Microstructure Profiler measured the small-scale density structure and the dissipation rates of kinetic energy and temperature."
