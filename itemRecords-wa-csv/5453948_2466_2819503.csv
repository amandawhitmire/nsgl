12,Abstract:,"This book comprises a review of current knowledge and an introduction to the literature concerning six species potentially or actually of commercial value in the northern Pacific: northern pink shrimp, Pacific sand lance, Pacific herring, walleye pollock (two stocks), market squid, and Pacific halibut. Each section contains background information on the species, including fishery area, population abundance, and recruitment variability. Life history stages (egg, larva, juvenile, and spawning adult) are described with respect to distribution and abundance; feeding and predation; other factors affecting that particular stage; and laboratory holding and rearing measures. Factors that affect year-class abundance are discussed; each section has its own bibliography. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. Northern pink shrimp, ""Pandalus borealis"", in the Gulf of Alaska and eastern Bering Sea. Christopher Dungan, David A. Armstrong, Thomas S. Sibley and Janet Armstrong, pp. 1-14. 2. Pacific sand lance, ""Ammodytes hexapterus"", with notes on related ""Ammodytes"" species. L. Jay Field pp. 15-33. 3. Pacific herring, ""Clupea harengus pallasi"", northeast Pacific and Bering Sea. Daniel J. Grosse and Douglas E. Hay pp. 34-54. 4. Walleye pollock, ""Theragra chalcogramma"", in the eastern Bering Sea. Lewis S. Incze, C. Macgill Lynde, Suam Kim and Richard S. Strickland pp. 55-69. 5. Walleye pollock, ""Theragra chalcogramma"", in the Gulf of Alaska. Suam Kim and Donald R. Gunderson pp. 70-82. 6.
