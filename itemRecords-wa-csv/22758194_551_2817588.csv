13,Abstract:,"Rip currents are narrow, fast-moving offshore-​directed flows that can sweep swimmers out from surf zone into deeper water. Hundreds of fatalities and incidents reported on the Great Lakes coasts are caused by rip currents, which impose severe hazards to the Great Lakes beach users. The objective of this dissertation is to characterize rip currents in Lake Michigan and in Lake Superior, and to develop assessment tools for effective warning of the rip current hazards to coastal communities. Flash rips are transient and intermittent rip currents. To provide real-time flash rip warnings to beach users, a Lifeguarding Operational Camera Kiosk System (LOCKS) is developed and implemented at the North Beach of Port Washington, WI. LOCKS has three components. First, a real-time environmental observation system acquires timely beach view images and local environmental condition data. Second, an integrated nowcast forecast operational system, high performance and distributed computing infrastructure,​ digitally detects and assesses flash rip hazards in high, moderate, or low risks. Third, an automated kiosk dynamically issues real-​time on-​site warnings by a three-color dynamic light and a digital display monitor. Results show that LOCKS can detect flash rips in both sunny and cloudy days with an overall accuracy of 83%. Characteristics of flash rips are observed to have nonstationary locations and intermittent occurrences. The developed flash rip occurrence checklist is demonstrated to reliably assess the likelihood of hazardous flash rips by using two new proxies of visual images and convective storms. The observed co-occurrence of convective storms and flash rips suggests future studies on investigating the meteorologicall​y induced water level oscillations in generating flash rips. Flash rips generated by meteorologicall​y induced water level oscillations (MIWLOs) are revealed to pose unrecognized hazards to the unawareness of beach users. Occurrences and causative processes of generating flash rips are investigated in Lake Michigan at the North Beach of Port Washington, by compiling images, hydrodynamic and atmospheric observations with reconstructed velocity fields from integrated atmospheric-​hydrodynamic modeling. Results show that meteotsunamis, seiches, wind waves, and combined effects are all pathways to generate flash rips. Temporal transiency, intermittency, and spatial ubiquity and unpredictabilit​y are characteristics of flash rips induced by MIWLOs and elevated the hidden danger to beach swimmers. Rip currents generated by MIWLOs are found to be associated with 70% of current related incidents on the Great Lakes coasts. Statistics evidence also suggests that causes of many incidents on United States ocean coasts can be related to the unrecognized flash rip hazards. Hidden flash rips can be wide-spread hazards, as several drowning incidents occurred across Lake Michigan during a series of convective storms. Features of storm disturbances and hydrodynamic forcing are characterized to depict possible causes of the drowning incidents. Nearshore processes generating unexpected flash rips through storm-induced energetic wind waves, meteotsunami-​induced longshore currents, water level drawdowns, and seiches are revealed. Hidden flash rip hazards are frequent under both low meteorologicall​y induced water level oscillations and low wind waves, a condition has not been recognized before. The time delay in flash rip occurrences relative to convective storms further elevates the risk of the hidden danger to the unaware beach swimmers. Rip currents near coastal structures are one cause for drownings in the Great Lakes. A Structure Rip Checklist and Assessment Matrix (SRiCAM) is developed by characterizing rip currents near breakwaters and aims to provide timely warnings to beach users. Rip currents occurrences near the north breakwater of Port Washington, are associated with environmental proxies. Results show that rip currents can occur when the water appears seemingly calm near the structure, thus imposing hidden dangers to unalerted beach users. The performance of the SRiCAM shows consistency and inclusiveness by using the four-level tier assessment. Furthermore, the SRiCAM is integrated into a cyberinfrastruc​ture with a data contingency plan to provide real-time warnings to the public. The applicability of the SRiCAM is also demonstrated by applying to thirty-eight other locations and shows great potential to be widely extended to wider regions of the Great Lakes to foster the resilience of recreational water users to the rip current hazards. Lastly, rip currents are characterized on the western shore of Lake Superior. Remote-​sensing data including aerial imagery, coastal LiDAR elevations, and nearshore webcam images are analyzed to detect bathymetry features like nearshore bars where rip currents are prone to occur at two beaches, the 12th St Beach and the 22nd St Beach in Duluth, MN. Results show that double crescent bar systems, experiencing dynamic evolution on the time scale from years to hours, are dominant along the western shore of Lake Superior. The documented bathymetric characteristics​ provide information about hotspots and can be used to facilitate the future studies of rip currents on the western shore of Lake Superior for the resilience to rip current hazards for the Great Lakes coastal communities."
