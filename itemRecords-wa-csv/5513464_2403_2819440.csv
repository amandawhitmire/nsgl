11,Abstract:,"The ultimate objective of this project is to analyze Puget Sound marine fishes for long-term changes. Analyses of distributional differences in Puget Sound have been conducted and notable patterns exist, but those analyses did not incorporate the long term. The objective of the study reported here was to inventory the more extensive historical data sets to evaluate their suitability for use in the time-trend analysis. Information on location, date, gear used, number of sets made, depths sampled and types of data recorded were reviewed and included in the inventory to determine if these data were available in sufficient temporal and spatial coverage and of sufficient quality to evaluate trends in selected species or populations ov er time."
