9,Abstract:,"Our marine environment is increasingly threatened by the trash we dump into it. In earlier times, throwing trash overboard may have been relatively harmless because most of it sank and degraded quickly. Over the past few decades, however, the composition of our trash has changed. Plastic packaging, plastic containers, synthetic ropes, nets and traps and similar plastic items, once discarded, float in the water and degrade very slowly. Because plastics and other persistent marine debris pose a serious problem worldwide, national and international regulations have been created to reduce marine pollution. The most widely relevant regulations are explained here. In addition, there are steps every water user can take to stop contributing to the marine debris problem."
