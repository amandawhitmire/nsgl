10,Abstract:,"Crab Team Fall 2017 Newsetter: The 2017 Crab Team sampling season has officially concluded, and We – with a capital “W”, inclusive of the whole community of Crab Team volunteers, partners, cheerleaders and staff – can be very proud of what We’ve accomplished this year. A growing community of partners all pulling together to steward Washington’s pocket estuaries, doubling the number of sites in the monitoring network. This growth was facilitated by a groundswell of concern over the threat of invasive European green crab, and was only possible with the support of partners from tribes, federal and state agencies, and local stewardship groups.Crab Team Spring 2017 Newsletter: Traps are officially in the mud and 2017 sampling started with a bang. The captures of European green crab at Westcott Bay and Padilla Bay last year inspired tremendous support from many different stakeholder groups wanting to help protect shorelines. In addition to new citizen science volunteers, this year, Crab Team is developing and strengthening partnerships with agencies – like Washington’s Department of Natural Resources and US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) – and tribes. Many of these groups are helping expand the scope of Crab Team monitoring by purchasing gear and training staff biologists to conduct Crab Team surveys. A huge thank you to the Skagit Marine Resources Committee which secured funding for gear for 16 additional sites. All told, we currently have more than 40 sites actively monitoring around Washington’s Salish Sea, with more to come!"
