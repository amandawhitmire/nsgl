14,Abstract:,"Increasing atmospheric CO2 equilibrates with surface seawater, elevating the concentration of aqueous hydrogen ions. This process, ocean acidification, is a future and contemporary concern for aquatic organisms, causing failures in Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) aquaculture. This experiment determines the effect of elevated pCO2 on the early development of C. gigas larvae from a wild Pacific Northwest population. Adults were collected from Friday Harbor, Washington, USA (48deg 31.7'N, 12deg 1.1'W) and spawned in July 2011. Larvae were exposed to Ambient (400 uatm CO2), MidCO2 (700 uatm), or HighCO2 (1,000 uatm). After 24 h, a greater proportion of larvae in the HighCO2 treatment were calcified as compared to Ambient. This unexpected observation is attributed to increased metabolic rate coupled with sufficient energy resources. Oyster larvae raised at HighCO2 showed evidence of a developmental delay by 3 days post-​fertilization, which resulted in smaller larvae that were less calcified."
