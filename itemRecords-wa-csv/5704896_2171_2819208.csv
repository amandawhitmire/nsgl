10,Abstract:,"Coastal inlets dot the world's coastline, serving as important conduits for exchange of organic and inorganic materials between the continents and the oceans. In addition, inlets are the focal points of navigation pathways between deep water and coastal ports, a function often requiring alteration of the inlet to assure safe navigation. Particularly for inlets along mobile barrier beaches, frequent dredging is often required to maintain navigation clearances. The papers in this book discuss research relating to tidal inlets along barrier beach systems and illustrate the scientific approaches appropriate for examining multiple inlet stability. The aim is to provide a scientific basis for effective management. Case examples are included that will be useful to those who may wish to pursue the wider management and policy implications."
