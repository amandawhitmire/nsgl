8,Abstract:,'We can begin by reinvigorating our school system so that science and math courses are strengthened and not cut and students are encouraged and not culled out of the system. The more difficult part will be to educate the general populace in new ways of thinking and dealing with our environmental issues and funding priorities. This will indeed be a challenge for all of us.' So ends this essay on the current paucity of knowledge and values that plagues the modern world.
