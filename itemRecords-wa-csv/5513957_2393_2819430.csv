11,Abstract:,"There is a continued demand for improved techniques for the storage of salmonid semen to facilitate artificial breeding programs and to preserve valuable genotypes. This paper describes a simple method of improving the fertilizing capacity of thawed semen from rainbow trout (""Oncorhynchus mykiss"") by the addition of theophylline, a caffeine relative that prolongs and intensifies sperm motility, to the fertilization activator solution."
