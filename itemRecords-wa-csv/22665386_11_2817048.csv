10,Abstract:,"The Vision: Coastal communities are more resilient to weather and climate hazards with Sea Grant support to improve planning and risk assessment, disaster preparedness and recovery, resilience design and project implementation, and long-standing economic and social inequities. The acute and chronic threats facing our nation’s coasts underscore the need to enhance Sea Grant’s efforts through the establishment of a dedicated national effort to generate and provide science-based information to reduce the social, economic and environmental costs of natural hazards, both chronic and episodic, to our coastal communities. Se​a Grant is uniquely poised to help coastal and Great Lakes communities become more resilient through its activities that strengthen the ability of communities to effectively prepare and plan for environmental and economic challenges. To fully implement this new initiative, an increase in funding of approximately $25M per year is needed for the National Sea Grant College Program. This investment would focus on two major areas: ◆ Capacity building ($10M): These funds will support recruitment of additional resilience extension, communication or education staff in each state Sea Grant program and support a national coordinator. ◆ Research, engagement, decision support, implementation ($15M): These funds will be directly allocated to state Sea Grant programs to support local state-based research, training, technical assistance and coordination that enhance community resilience."
