11,Abstract:,"""Opaepele loihi"", new genus and species, is described from hydro- thermal vents on Loihi Seamount, Hawaii, a mid-late, hot-spot volcano at 18 deg. 55'N, 155 deg. 16'W, 980 m depth. This new form is related to several other bresiliid shrimps associated with hydrothermal vents, brine and hydrocarbon seeps. Only two of the vent/seep bresiliid species are now known from depths less than 1000 m, ""A. stactophila,"" from hydrocarbon seeps at 534 m in the Gulf of Mexico, and the present new species at 980 m."
