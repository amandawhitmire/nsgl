10,Abstract:,"The Asian clam originated from southeast Asia. First introduced on the west coast of North America around 1924, it was discovered in Washington state in 1937. By the 1970s, the clam occupied most of the Mississippi Basin, the Gulf Coast and eastern United States. Although New England was considered environmentally inhospitable, Asian clams were discovered in the lower Connecticut River, near Haddem Neck, Connecticut, in 1990. This fact sheet provides information on this invader, which is a serious biofouler of raw water intake pipes for power and water suppliers and industries."
