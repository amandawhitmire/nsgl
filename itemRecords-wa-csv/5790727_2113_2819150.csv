11,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study was to estimate the immediate effects, such as changes in catch or discard rates, of potential regulated changes to cod end mesh size or mesh shape in the U.S. west coast nearshore mixed fishery. For all cod ends, the inner nearshore had a consistently greater percent total discard than the outer nearshore. Individual cod end results showed that the 76-mm diamond gave excessively high size-discard rates for both areas. The 114- mm square mesh performed well in the outer nearshore, giving high utilized weight per hour and low size-discard weight per hour. The 114-mm diamond mesh did better in the inner nearshore, where a larger percentage of flatfish were utilized, giving a reasonable utilized weight per hour and also a low size-discard weight per hour."
