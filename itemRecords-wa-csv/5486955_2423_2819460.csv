10,Abstract:,"Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) produced by toxigenic dinoflagellates have been shown to move through marine food chains and accumulate in a variety of marine organisms. Although the risk to humans from eating bivalves contaminated with PST has been well documented worldwide, the biological significance of the sequestering of these toxins is poorly understood. Experiments suggest that PSP toxins could function as an effective predator defense in prey capable of sequestering the neurotoxins and may limit the distribution and abundance of species that either avoid or die from eating these prey. In light of the importance of sodium channels and their sensitivity to saxitoxin in most metazoans, such predators could include a wide range of both vertebrates and invertebrates. An addendum to this paper was published in the same journal [8(1):253, 1989] and may be ordered at no charge from WASHU using the document number WSG-TA 89-2 or borrowed from the NSGD under the document number WASHU-R-89-002."
