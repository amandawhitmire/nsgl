11,Abstract:,"This report briefly summarizes a feasible system for the exploration and utilization of Cobb Seamount. The scientific worth and economic implications of both manned and unmanned instrumented stations on Cobb are explored. Based on the estimated scientific and economic merit, a system comprised of a semi-permanent underwater habitat located below the pinnacle, a surface piercing mast from the pinnacle and a network of remote instruments is proposed. In the manned phases of the project, a submersible as well as free divers will be used. Throughout the proposed system, state of the art components are used in order to make the implementation of the proposed system feasible at an early date, should funds become available."
