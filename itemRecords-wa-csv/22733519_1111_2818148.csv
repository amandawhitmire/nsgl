13,Abstract:,"This report is focused on Haida marine traditional knowledge about iinang, herring, and was prepared by the Council of the Haida Nation Marine Planning Program to support development of the Haida Gwaii Herring Rebuilding Plan. The Rebuilding Plan is being developed by the Herring Technical Working Group. The Technical Working Group is made up of staff of the Council of the Haida Nation (CHN), Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and Parks Canada. Our use of the term “traditional knowledge” is intended to capture the elements of Berkes’ definition, while also capturing a cultural distinction between the Indigenous and settler populations of Haida Gwaii. It focuses on marine and maritime species, and the marine environment. We have not limited the knowledge to “ecological” because we are also documenting cultural, historical, economic, political and societal information as it pertains to the marine environment. Due to the inherent importance of marine resources to Haidas, it is difficult to separate ecological knowledge from other topics and broader observations about society and economy, a reflection of social-​ecological interconnectedn​ess. The Gwaii Haanas Gina ’Waadluxan KilGuhlGa Land-Sea-People Management Plan (Gwaii Haanas AMB, 2018) identifies a target of incorporating Haida traditional knowledge “into decision-​making processes for Archipelago Management Board (AMB) identified fisheries (e.g., Pacific herring) by 2020 - and for all fisheries in Gwaii Haanas by 2023.” (Obj.4.2 Target.1). We explore later how knowledge summarized in this report can be incorporated into herring assessments and decisions. These include: • Inform reference points for fisheries management, e.g. ecological, economic, sociocultural • Improve understanding of herring biology, life history, and ecology • Understand spatial dynamics of stocks i.e. finer stock structure and socioeconomic outcomes • Understand effects of fisheries e.g., spawn on kelp vs sac roe fishery, ecosystem interactions, gear and technology • Document ecosystem changes e.g., climate and predator changes • Support and inform co-management decision-making and reconciliation processes The report relies heavily on the Haida Marine Traditional Knowledge Study reports that were completed in 2011, and includes new insights from Haida participants who participated in herring knowledge interviews in 2016 as part of the Ocean Tipping Points project. We have presented information in sections relating to important places, ecological observations, fisheries management, and social and cultural aspects of fisheries that can be incorporated into specific sections of the Haida Gwaii Herring Rebuilding Plan."
