12,Abstract:,"The survey was done in order to identify the attitudes and behaviors of residents in the Lake Whatcom watershed. Lake Whatcom is the source of drinking water for approximately half of Whatcom County. The survey will be used to guide the development of a Residential Homeowners Guide publication as well as future educational programming. It will be repeated every 5 years. The purpose of the resulting survey was to set a baseline around these specific topics about residents’ knowledge or behavior, and to collect information that may be useful for program development and outreach. Ultimately, the survey included 65 questions about people’s relevant practices and awareness as well as their attitudes or beliefs about the lake and demographic characteristics​."
