9,Abstract:,"West coast oyster sales normally decrease as much as 70% during the summer spawning season, when swollen gonads cause oysters to become soft, sour, and less appetizing. Triploid oysters have an extra set of chromosomes-​-​three instead of the normal two. The extra chromosomes prevent the oysters from reaching normal spawning condition. Now triploids are coming into widespread commercial production on the west coast, and consumers and growers alike are looking forward to having their favorite shellfish any time of the year they want them. Noted here are a laboratory manual (WASHU-​H-​89-​001) and instructional videotape (WASHU-​V-​89-​001) that accurately convey the technique for creating triploid Pacific oysters with the chemical cytochalasin B. As a package, the manual and video are suitable for oyster hatchery operators and for undergraduate and graduate students in fisheries, biology, zoology, and genetics."
