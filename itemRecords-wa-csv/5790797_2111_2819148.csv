11,Abstract:,"Salinamides are novel, bicyclic depsipeptides produced by ""Streptomyces"" sp.CNB-091 that exhibit potent topical anti- inflammatory activities. Here, the author and colleagues have focused on salinamide biosynthesis at the biochemical and genetic levels to serve as a model for future work with marine bacterial secondary metabolic pathways. They have demonstrated that the published structures for salinamides A and B are the enantiomers of the correct structures, determined the basic biosynthetic building blocks for the two novel non-amino acid moieties, generated two structural analogs, and cloned and sequenced a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene from the salinamide producing organism."
