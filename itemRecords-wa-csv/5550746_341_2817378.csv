13,Abstract:,"This cruise was the first of a series designed to monitor the physical and chemical oceanographic characteristics of Puget Sound, in connection with a detailed study of Skagit Bay. Representative stations were taken in the major basins of the Sound, north of the Tacoma Narrows; sampling was particularly extensive and intensive in Skagit Bay. The objectives of this cruise, and the similar ones to follow, are two-fold: 1. to provide basic data for research on the physical and chemical oceanography of the area, and 2. to provide environmental data for the Fisheries Research Institute, University of Washington, for their concurrent studies of salmon migrations through Skagit Bay."
