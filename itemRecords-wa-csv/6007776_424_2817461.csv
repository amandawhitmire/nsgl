9,Abstract:,"This four-page summary publication is based on ""Marine riparian: an assessment of riparian functions in marine ecosystems,"" by James S. Brennan and Hilary Culverwell. Marine nearshore environments are some of the most resource-rich and economically important ecosystems in the world. However, the full range of services they provide, as well as the processes that shape these systems, are poorly understood. Riparian areas are the lands adjacent to lakes, streams, marine shorelines, wetlands and other aquatic systems. Freshwater riparian areas have been studied extensively in recent decades. However, marine riparian areas-the vegetated lands on the banks of Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca and other coastal shores-have been neglected. Their functions and benefits have not been adequately identified or integrated into strategies for managing our shorelines. As a result, many marine riparian areas have been significantly modified and their functions altered or destroyed by human activities."
