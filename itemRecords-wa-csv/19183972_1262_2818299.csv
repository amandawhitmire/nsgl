15,Abstract:,"Bird scaring lines (BSLs) protect longline fishing gear from seabird attacks, save bait and reduce incidental seabird mortality. We collaborated with fishermen to assess the practicality and potential effectiveness of two BSLs with aerial extents of 40 m for West Coast sablefish longline fishery. We also evaluated the effectiveness of night setting in reducing albatross bycatch rates using NOAA West Coast Groundfish Observer Program data from 2002-2013. Some West Coast vessels use floats to keep hooks off the seafloor, where macroinvertebra​tes and hagfish degrade bait and target catch. Results from our field work confirmed that pending regulations protected baits from bird attacks on longlines without floats, but not on longlines with floats. Floated longlines sank below the reach of albatrosses (2 m depth) at 157.7 m astern ± 44.8 95% CI or 2.3 times further astern than gear without floats (68.8 m ± 37.8 95% CI), well beyond the protection afforded by the 40 m BSL aerial extent. Albatross attacked floated longlines at rates ten times more (2.7 attacks/1000 hooks, 0.48 – 4.45 95%CI) than longlines without floats (0.20 attacks/1000 hooks, 0.01 – 0.36 95% CI). Night setting, however, reduced albatross bycatch rates an order of magnitude lower than setting during daylight hours. Therefore, night-setting could be an effective seabird bycatch prevention practice in the West Coast sablefish longline fishery and provide a practical alternative for vessels that elect to use floated longlines. These results highlight the importance of understanding region-specific longline characteristics in order to design effective bycatch reduction programs and regulations."
