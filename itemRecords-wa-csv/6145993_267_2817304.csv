12,Abstract:,Pelagic fisheries managed by international agreements constitute one of the greatest conservation threats to Southern ocean seabirds. Seabird mortality occurs in longline fisheries when seabirds depredate sinking baits as gear is deployed and become hooked and drown. Effective seabird bycatch mitigation must exclude diving birds to protect albatrosses. Mitigation involves sinking baits beyond the reach of surface foraging and diving seabirds as quickly as possible and preventing seabirds from accessing baits in the zone in which they are vulnerable. The objectives of this project were to: (1) continue work begun in the New Zealand joint venture fishery to establish essential tori line design elements that will ultimately be tested in controlled experiments; (2) document gear sink rates and test-line weighting modifications designed to increased sink rates; and (3) refine protocols to detect seabird behavior shifts in response to varying pelagic tori line treatments.
