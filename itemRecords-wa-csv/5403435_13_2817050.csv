10,Abstract:,"The Sea Grant program fills a unique niche in American marine science and among university science activities generally. The Sea Grant programs have developed a responsive network of institutions and scientists. As the examples in this book demonstrate, this network is a productive, innovative, and efficient enterprise which has provided many benefits to the nation. The Sea Grant network has special capabilities to address the nation's marine resource and marine environmental needs and opportunities. If the problems caused by funding erosion can be addressed, and Sea Grant' s unique role reaffirmed, the network will be even more effective in the future. Sea Grant has been a successful national experiment during its first twenty years of operation. The network of Sea Grant universities and institutions is an effective national instrument for scientific progress, technology transfer and economic and social benefits. This innovative nationwide network should be maintained and strengthened."
