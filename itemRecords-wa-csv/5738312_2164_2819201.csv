12,Abstract:,"In this study, the authors had three goals: (1) to develop a reliable method of live-staining heterotrophic and autotrophic protists, (2) to test the hypothesis that pollock larvae can ingest aloricate ciliates, and (3) to determine if stained prey can be used as a tracer of ingestion in pollock larvae. They found that DAPI (a fluorescent DNA-specific stain; 2,4-​diamadino-​6-​ phenylindole) effectively live-stained several species of heterotrophic and autotrophic protists, and that laboratory- reared larval pollock ingested the DAPI-stained ciliate, ""Euplotes"" sp., which was easily seen in the fish gut after ingestion."
