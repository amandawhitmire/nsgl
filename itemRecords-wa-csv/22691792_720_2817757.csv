16,Abstract:,"Growth during the early marine critical period is positively associated with survivaland recruitment for Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., so it is important to understand how certainforaging strategies may bolster growth in estuarine and marine environments. To elucidatehow spatiotemporal and demographic differences in diet contribute to growth rate variability, weanalyzed stomach contents in tandem with morphometric and hormonal indices of growth for subyearlingChin​ook salmon O. tshawytscha captured in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. Regionaldietary patterns indicated that fish caught in northern Puget Sound ate insects in the estuarineand nearshore habitats, followed by decapod larvae, euphausiids, or forage fish in the offshorezone. In southern Puget Sound, fish ate insects in the estuary but were more likely to eat mysidsand other crustaceans in the nearshore zone. In the marine habitats adjacent to the San JuanIslands, subyearlings ate forage fish, and their stomachs were as much as 1.4 to 3 times fuller thansalmon captured in other regions. Scale-derived growth rates and insulin-like growth factor-1 levelsshowed distinct growth advantages for San Juan Islands fish which were strongly associatedwith the early adoption of piscivory. However, consumption of larger crustaceans such as mysidsand euphausiids was also associated with greater relative growth regardless of where individualswere captured. These findings highlight how spatiotemporal differences in prey quantity, preyprofitabili​ty, and individual foraging strategies result in variable growth rates among salmon populations.Spe​cifically, they emphasize the role of piscivory in promoting early marine growth forout-​migrating Chinook salmon."
