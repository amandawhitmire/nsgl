8,Abstract:,"The Olympia oyster is the only oyster species native to the U.S. West Coast. As a filter feeding bivalve, it is an important contributor to the functioning of estuarine ecosystems, from both a water quality standpoint and because it provides three-​dimensional habitat for a variety of estuarine organisms. During the 1800s and 1900s, the overall population was significantly reduced due to over-harvest, poor water quality, siltation, and the introduction of non-native predators and competitors. However, there are remnant populations, varying from a few scattered individuals to significant, self-sustaining beds comprising millions of individuals. A pre-conference field trip took participants to a Puget Sound native oyster bed that is estimated to hold up to 50 million individuals. Even with such isolated strongholds, it is clear that the overall population is greatly diminished, as compared with populations prior to European settlement. There are more examples of depleted local populations than abundant ones."
