11,Abstract:,"Approved by Congress in 1998, the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative works toward consensus-​building in the protection and restoration of marine resources in northern Washington state. Seven committees formed from representatives of the scientific community; government; tribes; and economic, recreational, and conservation interests strive to complement the efforts of state agencies and other organizations. This report describes significant achievements in restoration, resource protection, education, and outreach. Other important accomplishments​, including a very successful Derelict Fishing Gear Removal Project, are also depicted in detail."
