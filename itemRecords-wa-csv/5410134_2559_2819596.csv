9,Abstract:,"This volume contains 28 papers that address five topics: methodology and statistics; physiology of feeding and digestion; foraging behavior; competition and resource partitioning; and predation effects on prey behavior and ecology. The workshop was most notable for exploring untrod ground on several topics: (1) the evolution of feeding and digestion organs and foraging strategies; (2) the physiological basis for digestion; (3) the casual `psychology' behind feeding decisions; and (4) the diverse constraints upon and approaches to falsifying hypotheses of resource partitioning and competition. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. Types of feeding in the ontogeny of fishes and the life-history model. E. K. Balon pp. 11-24. 2. Foraging behavior in fishes: perspectives on variance. B. M. Marcotte and H.I. Browman pp. 25-34. 3. Mythical models of gastric emptying and implications for food consumption studies. M. Jobling pp. 35-50. 4. Patterns of food evacuation in fishes: a critical review. L. Pearson pp. 51-58. 5. The physiology of digestion in fish larvae. J. J. Govoni, et al. pp. 59- 78. 6. Feeding by larvae of ""Hypoatherina tropicalis"" (Pisces: atherinidae) and its relation to prey availability in One Tree Lagoon, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. P. D. Schmitt pp. 79-94. 7.

White pp. 105-112. 9. Feeding rate and attack specialization: the roles of predator experience and energetic tradeoffs. J. R. Bence pp. 113-122. 10. Foraging in surfperches: resource partitioning or individualistic responses? A.W. Ebeling and D.R. Laur pp. 123-134. 11. Food acquisition by competing surfperch on a patchy environmental gradient. S.J. Holbrook and R. J. Schmitt pp. 135-146. 12. Ecological and morphological shifts in Lake Michigan fishes: glimpses of the ghost of competing past. L.B. Crowder pp. 147-158. 13.
