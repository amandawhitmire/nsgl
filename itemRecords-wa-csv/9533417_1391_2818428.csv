11,Abstract:,"Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have gained attention in recent years as emerging contaminants that are increasing in use and have demonstrated negative effects on aquatic organisms. There is a growing body of literature on the effects of PPCPs on freshwater and vertebrate marine organisms, but little research has been conducted on the effects of PPCPs in marine and estuarine invertebrates. We present a review of the current published research on the biological effects on marine and estuarine invertebrates exposed to PPCPs. We also present empirical data on contaminant types and concentrations in Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida). Field sampling identified variability in contaminant types across sites and between seasons from samples collected in Oregon during 2013-14."
