8,Abstract:,"With growing consumer interest in seafood, product quality has become the key to increased sales and long-term profits. Proper handling and temperature control are essential from the time the seafood is harvested until the time it is prepared so that spoilage and decomposition may be minimized. The seafood retailer is near the end of the distribution chain, and relies on fishermen, processors, and wholesalers to supply high quality products. To provide high quality seafood to customers, retailers should be aware of the causes of seafood spoilage and know how to control them. This publication addresses that."
