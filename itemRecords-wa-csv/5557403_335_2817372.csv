18,Abstract:,"The two species of herring discussed at this symposium have supported commercial fisheries worldwide for centuries. In the Atlantic Ocean fishing pressure increased to the point of serious depletion of herring stocks; however, because of effective management over the last 20 years, some of the stocks have recovered. Scientists, managers, and policy makers at the symposium explored new developments in population regulation and stock structure, considered harvest policy evaluation, and reported recent research on the early life history of Atlantic and Pacific herring."
