14,Abstract:,Crab and shrimp resources were sampled in and around potential sites in Port Gardner to be used for confined disposal of clean and contaminated dredged sediments. The initial site selected by the Navy for dredged material disposal was found to be in conflict with preferred use of the site by gravid female Dungeness crabs. This led to the selection of a site in deeper water. The sampling data showed that average crab densities were about 10 times less and pandalid shrimp abundances about 5 times less at the alternate site. Further sampling after a year of dredged material disposal indicated continued suitability of the deep site in terms of Dungeness crab distribution patterns.
