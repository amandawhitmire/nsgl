9,Abstract:,"This Strategic Plan describes Washington Sea Grant Program (WSGP) – the context in which WSGP operates, critical program areas and the strategies for meeting the goals for these areas. WSGP serves communities, industries and the people of Washington state, the Pacific Northwest and the nation through research, education and outreach by identifying and addressing important marine issues and providing better tools for management and use of the marine environment and its resources.  WSGP uses a strategic partnership approach that includes: other universities and educational institutions; tribal and local, state and federal agencies; business and industry; marine-​oriented interest groups; and citizens of the state of Washington. WSGP also benefits from close interaction with elements of NOAA and other federal agencies and laboratories in the Northwest. For 1999-2010, WSGP will focus on the following five critical program areas: Living Marine Resources, Ecosystem Health, New Technologies to Enhance Ocean Productivity, Economic and Community Development, and Education, Training and Public Information."
