9,Abstract:,"This invaluable guide to the basics of the septic system was originally produced along with five manuals and a number of fact sheets all relating to septic system use and maintenance. This fact sheet explains in very practical terms how septic systems work. With this information, the reader is then able to apply the basic guidelines regarding the use of soaps, detergents, water, toilet tissue, garbage disposals, and other elements that affect septic systems. You may be surprised to learn, for instance, that how much laundry you do at once can impact your tank and drainfield. Intelligent choices at home and occasional professional maintenance will help extend the life of a septic system, which can benefit both the environment and the homeowner."
