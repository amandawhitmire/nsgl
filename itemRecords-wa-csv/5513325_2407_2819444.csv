12,Abstract:,"Commercial fishing has long been a major component of the Pacific Northwest economy, but women's participation in the industry has largely gone unnoticed. This book marks the first attempt by anthropologists to document the range of choices available to women in commercial fishing. In providing examples of women's many roles as producers, processors, distributors, service providers, managers, and regulators, the ten life histories presented here not only provide a view of the industry as a whole, but also convey the singular quality of these women's lives. With its threefold emphasis on women, social science methodology, and the commercial fishing industry, this book will appeal to anthropologists​, social historians, individuals with maritime interests, and all who are intrigued by the lives and environment of these spirited and remarkable women."
