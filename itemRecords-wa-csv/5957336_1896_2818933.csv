11,Abstract:,"This manual helps identify all 37 rockfish species found along the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia. These species of the genera ""Sebastes"" and ""Sebastolobus"" include most of the rockfishes found off Washington and Oregon as well. The book is spiral-bound and printed on water- resistant stock for use on board fishing vessels and in processing plants. Fisheries managers, recreational fishermen, divers, and anyone who may not have the desire or time to use a key for rockfish identification will also find the publication useful. Color photographs are the essential component of the guide, supported by diagrams and descriptions."
