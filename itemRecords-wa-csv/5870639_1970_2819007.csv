14,Abstract:,"Despite the simple structure and widespread occurrence of benzoic acid, its biosynthesis has resisted complete elucidation. Now research reveals that the conversion of cinnamoyl-CoA into benzoyl-CoA can proceed by a route that resembles fatty acid the beta-oxidation. Feeding studies and sequence analyses show that both pathways not only proceed with the same stereochemistryâ€‹, but are also mechanistically related."
