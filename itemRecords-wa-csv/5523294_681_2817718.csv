13,Abstract:,"This paper reviews studies on two kinds of noxious phytoplankton blooms that occur in Puget Sound, Washington. The first causes paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) and poses a serious problem for shellfish harvesting. Shellfish toxicity is likely to occur each year along the open ocean coast and appears to be caused by blooms originating in the ocean, not in the bays. The second primarily involves diatoms and causes mortality of finfish, particularly Atlantic salmon, reared in commercial net-pens."
