11,Abstract:,"Fond of shellfish? Washington waters offer a delectable variety of clams, oysters, mussels and scallops, readily available to be gathered and enjoyed. For seafood lovers, opportunities abound at many locales and most seasons of the year. ""When the tide is out, the table is set,"" as one beachcomber's adage maintains. At certain times, however, some shellfish may become unsafe to eat because they contain a poison harmful to human beings. Paralytic shellfish poisoning, commonly known as PSP, is a danger that you as a shellfish consumer can avoid by being well informed and by observing certain basic precautions. This publication provides information about PSP, its symptoms and treatment and its relationship to so-called ""red tides."" It also explains what is being done to protect recreational harvesters from this hazard, so that they ? and you ? can safely enjoy the bounty of Washington seashores."
