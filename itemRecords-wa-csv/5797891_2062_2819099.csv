9,Abstract:,"Scientists have identified and named over 1.4 million species. They think however, that there are probably millions of species (mostly insects and invertebrates) that have yet to be discovered. This incredible variety of life is what we call ""biodiversity"", short for biological diversity. Some estimates suggest nearly 50 percent of the world's species of plants, animals, and microorganisms will be destroyed or severely threatened over the next 25 years. Scientists believe this loss is due to habitat loss, introduced species, pollution, population growth, and over- consumption (HIPPO). Biodiversity is the safety net that allows our ecosystem to function and maintain life on Earth as we know it. The challenge for us, as educators, is to share with our students and leaders in our communities the importance of biodiversity and how it ultimately affects us all."
