13,Abstract:,"Here, scientists report that an efficient cotransformatio​n frequency in potatoes was obtained using two plasmids, each containing a neomycin phosphotransfer​ase (NPT II) gene and a pea beta-​1,3-​glucanase or chitinase gene, cloned separately using ""Agrobacterium tumefaciens"". The cotransformatio​n frequency of both genes was 1.6 percent per internode or 24 percent of total transformants. Results also demonstrated that both genes, including the intron- containing beta-​1,3-​glucanase, were expressed at the mRNA level in the transgenic plants."
