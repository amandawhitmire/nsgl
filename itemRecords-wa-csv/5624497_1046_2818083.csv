10,Abstract:,"Recent U.S. Supreme Court takings decisions invite greater judicial scrutiny of state and local shoreline management. The U.S. Supreme Court's ""Lucas"" decision may lead to reexamination of tidelands takings issues in all coastal states. In that decision, Justice Scalia acknowledged that state law is not frozen in time; rather 'changed circumstances or new knowledge may make what was previously permissible no longer so'. This would seem to allow adjustments in development rights through evolution of the public trust doctrine by state court decisions. However, if such state court decisions are viewed as revolutionary rather than evolutionary, one could envision application of the 5th Amendment to those decisions. Additional uncertainty is created by footnote seven of the majority opinion where the possiblity was raised that compensation might have to be paid for portions of property alleged to be rendered valueless even though other portions remained developable. The author here examines Oregon public access rights to coastal dry sand areas, applies the public trust doctrine to state ocean waters, and considers public trust doctrine support for nonpoint source pollution control."
