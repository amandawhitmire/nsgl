13,Abstract:,"Habitat selection by magalopae, and habitat preference and relative mortality of young-​of-​the-​year (YOY) Dungeness crab ""Cancer magister"" were evaluated in four Grays Harbor habitat types: bivalve shell middens (""Crassostrea gigas""), eelgrass ""Zostera marina,"" mud with scattered shell, and bare mud. Shell habitat provided the best protection from predation, and the proportion of crab eaten was highest on bare mud. Sculpin (""Leptocottus armatus"") was the most important fish preying on YOY crab in this area. Cannibalism by larger instars may account for part of the YOY mortality. Most evidence suggests that intertidal shell habitat enhances Dungeness crab survival during the first several months of benthic life. It has led to the use of artificial shell habitat as a technique to increase juvenile crab abundance and compensate crab losses due to dredging."
