13,Abstract:,"In salmonids, low fertility has been correlated with semen containing a low percentage of motile spermatozoa when diluted with an activating medium. This low motility, low fertility correlation does not appear to be due solely to an inadequate number of motile sperm per egg. Non-​motile sperm may affect the interaction of motile sperm with the oocyte. To investigate the possible interference of non-motile spermatozoa with fertilization, oocytes of Salmo gairdneri were fertilized with varying proportions of non-motile (heat-​inactivated) sperm before, after, or simultaneously with control (non-heated) sperm. Fertility was assayed by monitoring the resultant embryonic development to the eyed stage. The motility of heat-​inactivated semen was zero and its mean fertility was negligible. Addition of heat-​inactivated sperm after control sperm did not affect fertility. Fertility of motile sperm was reduced when the heat-​inactivated sperm were added first and their final concentration was equal to or greater than 90%, and when heat-​inactivated sperm were added simultaneously with the motile sperm and final concentration was 99%. Taken together, these data suggest that non-motile sperm can reduce the fertility of normal motile sperm, but this effect does not appear to play a major role in the determination of the level of fertility in fish semen unless the concentrati​on of motile sperm is less than 10%."
