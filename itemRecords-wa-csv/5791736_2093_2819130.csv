14,Abstract:,"The authors have previously reported that chitosan is an effective inducer of disease resistance responses in plants. They have observed that chitosan (especially oligomers of chitosan of at least 7 sugar units in size) can activate plant defense genes, can enter the nucleus of the pea cell, and has a high affinity for cellular DNA. While a model for its mode of action remains tentative, its proposed action on DNA-specific treatments."
