9,Abstract:,"Drawn to fishing vessels to scavenge on discards, birds can become hooked and drown during line setting. If not managed, this interaction is bad for fishing profits and bad for bird populations, especially long-lived species like the albatrosses, which produce few offspring. Birds that forage behind fishing vessels in the North Pacific include both surface feeders and those capable of diving to considerable depths. Regardless of diving ability, preventing birds from accessing baits within the upper six feet of the water column greatly reduces seabird bycatch and bait loss."
