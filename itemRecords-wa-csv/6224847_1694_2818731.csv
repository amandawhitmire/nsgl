9,Abstract:,"This is a feasible project with some inherent advantages enjoyed by the Lummi tribe, but it will also take careful planning and management, adequate staff training, and careful coordination between the retail operation, the tribal business office, and tribal fishermen to make it a successful long-term operation. There is an inherent marketing niche that the tribe possesses that it can exploit: the tribe's seafood heritage and respect for environment. There are also inherent cost savings to be realized, based on direct purchases from fishermen and the local nature of transportation and processing logistics. It is recommended that an initial custom processing arrangement be made with HomePort Seafoods. Other options may be available to the tribe at a later date. It is recommended that a relationship with Ocean Beauty Seafoods (Seattle) as a wholesale source of non-tribal generated seafood products might be advantageous, as one of their largest shareholders is the Bristol Bay (Alaska) Native Corporation. The chief competition with the Lummi market will be Barlean's Fisheries and the Haggen Food Store in Ferndale. It would be wise to survey possible customers at the Casino to see how willing they would be to purchase seafood from the market just down the road, if the seafood was a good value and adequately packaged for the trip home. It is highly recommended that a manager who has experience running a retail seafood counter, if not an entire retail seafood operation, be hired from the start. This retail seafood operation will contribute greatly to overall traffic in the Incubator Facility. Financially, it will cover most of its operational and overhead costs the first years, but it should not be looked upon to turn a profit initially. It will take some time to work the bugs out and produce a smooth-running operation. Likewise, it will be take some time to develop the right product mix to insure profitability and make the most use of tribal resources. Value-added tribal seafood products that will be generated by this project fit into this category."
