Seven pull-down menus cover topics such as water circulation in Puget Sound, species found in the region, the many ways humans use Puget Sound waters, and assessment of Puget Sound's health and ecosystems. The disc contains more than 500 megabytes of digital text, photos, video, animation and sound. It is designed for students in grades K-12 as well as adults. Users can explore individually, play games such as 'Sewerama' in teams, or use the CD-ROM as an audio-visual aid for lectures."
