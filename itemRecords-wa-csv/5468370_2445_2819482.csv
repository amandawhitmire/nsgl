10,Abstract:,"The research reported here addresses economic issues raised during recent debates on salmon farming policy in Alaska and Washington. Study results indicate that increased exports of Atlantic salmon have not had severe impacts on the market for Pacific salmon harvested in North America. However, the supply of farmed salmon worldwide will increase dramatically in the near future. The relationship between captured and farmed salmon is therefore likely to change, and should be monitored closely."
