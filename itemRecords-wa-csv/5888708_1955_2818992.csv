13,Abstract:,"Walleye pollock is an important species in the ecosystems of the subarctic Pacific Ocean, and is one of the world's largest fisheries. Management of Pollock stocks is based on harvests from large geographic regions. However, lumping stocks within these regions may be adverse to conservation and management goals. Here the population biology of walleye Pollock, ""Theragra chalcogramma,"" is described including its life history, population dynamics, genetic structure, and metapopulation structure."
