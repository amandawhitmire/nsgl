10,Abstract:,"A linked set of numerical models were used to better understand the complex dynamics of currents in central Puget Sound and Elliott Bay. A coarse-grid two-layer model of the central Puget Sound provides the current boundary conditions for the fine-grid four-layer model of the Elliott Bay region. The particle tracking model is applied to trace the possible trajectories of neutrally- buoyant waterborne pollutants from known sources in central Puget Sound and Elliott Bay. Detailed tidal and residual currents in both are presented, and the influence of bathymetry on residual currents is demonstrated. In addition to tidal forcing, effects of river inflow, wind, and density were also investigated."
