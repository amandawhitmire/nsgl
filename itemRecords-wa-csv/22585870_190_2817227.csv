10,Abstract:,"This is the first of four workshops in support of the Washington Coast Shellfish Aquaculture Study. The goal of this workshop is to advance a shared understanding among scientists, resource managers and shellfish farmers of how the ecosystems of Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor function, with particular attention to interactions among shellfish aquaculture, eelgrass and burrowing shrimp."
11,,"The Washington Coast Shellfish Aquaculture Study’s first workshop produced a list of over 50 information needs in service of the study’s objectives and ecosystem-based management in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor. Specific information needs are listed below, grouped by theme. Information needs were collected through three rounds of breakout group discussions among the working group members, workshop presenters and collaborating scientists.Each group was instructed to discuss their highest-​priority information needs during the first round and proceed in priority order through the second and third rounds. The numbers following each information need indicate the priority assigned via discussion round. Repeated numbers indicate that the information need was discussed during that same round in multiple breakout groups.The information needs are presented here after being processed for clarity. For the complete list of information needs as they were originally stated by the breakout groups, see Appendix A. The project team applied the following adjustments to the original material for this report:• To minimize repetition, we combined closely related information needs.• Information needs may relate to multiple themes. We have placed these information needs under the theme with which they are most connected to in service of the study.• Some information needs contained two distinct ideas that correspond to separate themes.In these cases, we have split the information need into two distinct needs."
