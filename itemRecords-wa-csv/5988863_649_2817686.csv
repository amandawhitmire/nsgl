10,Abstract:,"A new, high value product from the Turkish Towel Seaweed, ""Chondracanthus exasperatus,"" was developed recently by a Seattle company. However, Washington State has a long-term moratorium on commercial seaweed harvesting from wild populations so there is renewed interest in intensive cultivation of this species. The initial phase of this research was conducted at Mukilteo, Washington. There, strategies for long-term cultivation in tanks were tested, and a custom cultivation tank design was developed for pilot scale cultivation research on a site on the shore of Clam Bay near Manchester, Washington. Long-term cultivation is now being tested in tanks of up to 5000 L volume supplied with natural seawater, seawater supplemented with nutrients, and seawater effluent from nearby Pacific Halibut culture tanks. Seawater from Clam Bay is naturally rich in nutrients from tidal drive upwelling and nearby commercial salmon mariculture operations. Supplemental nutrients (commercially available ""f/2"" enrichment) and halibut culture tank effluent have both been tested for their ability to support ""C. exasperatus"" growth with relatively low seawater turnover rates. Compared to seawater at the site, Halibut tank effluent differs in both nutrient composition and quantities. Initial results indicate that halibut tank effluent is a satisfactory source of nutrients for ""C. exasperatus"" in intensive culture and that the Turkish Towel Seaweed scrubs significant quantities of nutrients from halibut tank effluent."
