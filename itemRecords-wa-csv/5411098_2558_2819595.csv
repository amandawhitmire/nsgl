10,Abstract:,"Increased conflict between the states and federal government over offshore activities, cuts in federal support for ocean programs, and the New Federalism rhetoric of the Reagan Administration appeared to spur expanded state interest in ocean policy. Based on a review of news items, journal articles, and conversations with state ocean policymakers, it appears that few states have actually made full-fledged efforts to grapple with marine policy issues raised by federal activities. Posing the issue in terms of federal/state relations, however, obscures another important change, namely the development of state institutions for dealing with marine issues. Although these institutions vary widely in their political influence and effectiveness within different states, they have the potential to enhance the ability of the states to adapt to marine issues within their own jurisdictions."
