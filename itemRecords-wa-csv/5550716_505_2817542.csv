13,Abstract:,"This was the second cruise of a series designed to monitor the physical and chemical oceanographic characteristics of Puget Sound, in connection with a detailed study of Skagit Bay. Oceanographic stations were taken north of Tacoma in the major basins of the Sound and its approaches, in Saratoga Passage and in Skagit Bay, where sampling was particularly intensive."
