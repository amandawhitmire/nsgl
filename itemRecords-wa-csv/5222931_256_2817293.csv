10,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study is to review the evolution of The Intergovernment​al Oceanographic Commission (IOC) in response to changing international marine needs and to assess the capacity of the Commission to respond to increasing international requirements for knowledge about the ocean and marine resources now and in the future. It is hoped that this analysis will provide some insight into what services the IOC is likely to provide in any future regime to manage ocean space-- and, more importantly, what it could provide to assist in the international solution of problems that threaten the responsible and productive use of the ocean for the benefit of all mankind."
