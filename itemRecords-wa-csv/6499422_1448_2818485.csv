12,Abstract:,"Maryland Sea Grant has produced a series of fact sheets on six aquatic invasive species of concern in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Each publication focuses on one species, summarizing how it arrived in the Chesapeake region, why it is harmful to the environment, what is being done to control it, and the current status of its population. This fact sheet focuses on water chestnut (Trapa natans), an aquatic plant native to Europe. This annual herb displays a floating rosette of triangular shaped leaves surrounding a central stem that stays rooted in the sediment. It reproduces at a fast rate, producing up to 20 nuts per rosette each growing season. The plant, which grows in shallow nutrient-rich waters, was first recorded in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in 1923 on the Potomac River near Washington, D.C. By 1993, 10,000 acres of dense beds extended from D.C. to just south of Quantico, Virginia. Water chestnut has also been found in Maryland on the Bird and Sassafras rivers. The plant is harmful because it spreads quickly and forms dense, floating mats that keep sunlight from reaching native Bay grasses growing in the sediment below. It is also a physical nuisance: the plant produces seeds with pointed spines that are sharp enough to penetrate shoe leather and can impede boat navigation and other water activities. Since the 1950s and 1969s, managers have relied on mechanical removal and herbicides to control water chestnut. More recently mechanical harvesting by boat and hand removal by volunteers have been successful at reducing populations."
