15,Abstract:,"Four hundred and sixty-three days after the Tōhoku Earthquake and Tsunami of March 11, 2011, a 21-foot (6.4 meter) skiff washed ashore on June 15, 2012 at Benson Beach on the outer coast of Cape Disappointment State Park, just north of the mouth of the Columbia River, near the town of Ilwaco, Washington. The vessel bore a Japanese vessel registration number (20-​210-​42909) permitting its identification by the Japanese Consulate as originating from the Tōhoku region of northern Honshu, and confirmed as being lost in the tsunami. In addition, the vessel bore the name of the prefecture, Miyagi (宮城), in smaller black writing, above the registration number. The vessel was named the Sou-you (壮 洋). This boat is the first Japanese vessel, associated with the tsunami, recorded to have landed in North America with living Japanese species. It may also be the first Japanese vessel with living Japanese species to ever be washed ashore in North America, as no previous records of a comparable incident are, at this time, known."
