13,Abstract:,"Washington Sea Grant social scientist Melissa Poe and graduate fellow Lauren Drakopulos organized a symposium for the 2018 American Fisheries Society meeting in Atlantic City, NJ. The title of the symposium was “Social Science at the Policy Interface: Case Studies in Building Resilient Fishing Communities” and it explored ways to better integrate social science into fisheries management so that decision-makers can understand and include the needs of fishing communities. Ca​se studies highlighted a variety of techniques for engaging fishing communities and decision-​makers, and for translating social science to policy featuring presentations from the Atlantic and Pacific regions. Presentations were followed by rich dialogue led by a panel of experts representing diverse groups and sectors, including industry, tribes, policy analysts, science communicators, and boundary-​spanning organizations."
