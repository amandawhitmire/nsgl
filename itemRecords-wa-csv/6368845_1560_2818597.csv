10,Abstract:,"While most people know what a sardine is, few are troubled as to their whereabouts. To stock assessment researchers at the University of Wash ington and NOAA, not to mention the fisher men, processors, and marketers involved in the second largest West Coast fishery, this topic is not a trivial one. Under a new project funded by Washington Sea Grant, a collaborative research team is focusing on the Pacific sardine to take on the problem of space in stock assessments."
