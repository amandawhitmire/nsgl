11,Abstract:,"The soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria, has a wide geographic distribution, indicating that it is tolerant of a variety of environmental conditions. Reproductive patterns and biology of this species of clam have been studied in Washington, Maine, and Chesapeake Bay. Information from several studies of the harvester on soft-shell clam stocks, associated biota, water column, and clam flat geology has been summarized and is discussed in this report. Recent​ly, many questions concerning the advisability of mechanical harvesting operations in Washington have been raised by a number of Puget Sound businesses, by concerned citizens, and by state resource management and regulatory agencies. In response to their questions, the Washington Sea Grant program undertook the survey reported in this publication to find out and make available existing information on the known long-term effects of mechanical harvesting on the environment. Through the survey and this report, the Sea Grant program is attempting to provide decision makers with available information as a basis for their decisions concerning applications for commercial clam-​harvesting permits."
