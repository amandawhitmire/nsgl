11,Abstract:,"Using observations of an energetic shear instability, researchers examine the energy budget of the mixing event by comparing microstructure measurements of the dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent potential energy with changes in fine-scale velocity and density. Two sets of observations are used. The first set sampled the shear instability early in its evolution, when overturns occurred in strong stratification. The second set of observations found the same water vertically homogenized by turbulent mixing. The flux Richardson number indicates that one quarter of the turbulent energy released by the instability goes toward increasing the mean potential energy of the water column."
