10,Abstract:,"Several species of non-indigenous marine invertebrates - primarily polychaete annelids - are regularly imported into southern California for use as live bait in recreational fishing. These species have the potential to become invasive and to negatively affect existing southern California marine communities. The goal of this study was to determine if non-indigenous bait species can survive at temperatures typically found in southern California coastal habitats. We measured survival of two commonly sold bait species and one associated parasite in three temperature treatments, simulating minimum (12�C), average (16�C), and maximum (25�C) temperatures of southern California coastal habitats. Bloodworms (Glycera sp.) from Maine, lugworms (Perinereis sp.) from Korea, and a potentially non-indigenous parasitic isopod (Ione cornuta) infecting bait ghost shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis) from Oregon and Washington, were exposed to temperature treatments for five days. All species showed >75% survival over five days of exposure to the two cooler treatments. In the warmer temperature treatment, >75% of Glycera sp. individuals survived, while <50% of the Perinereis sp. and I. cornuta individuals survived. Although we observed a decrease in survival in warmer temperature conditions (typically found only in shallow-water habitats partially isolated from the ocean such as estuaries and lagoons) our results suggest that short term survival of these species is not restricted by thermal conditions in southern California. Future studies should investigate long term survival and reproductive ability to help determine if these species can become established in southern California habitats."
