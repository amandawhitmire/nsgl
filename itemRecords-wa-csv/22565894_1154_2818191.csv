15,Abstract:,"Two NOAA-funded projects are documenting how shellfish farms interact with the environment.NOA​A Fisheries is committed to providing sustainable seafood by fostering marine aquaculture production, while also protecting our oceans and coastal ecosystems that aquatic species call home. Those homes, the wild fish that inhabit them, and their interactions with aquaculture are the focus of two NOAA-funded projects. Researchers from NOAA's Northeast and Northwest Fisheries Science Centers are using GoPro cameras to investigate how fish and invertebrates interact with different types of shellfish aquaculture. They are also comparing how fish utilize aquaculture gear with how they use their natural habitats. The data collected from these projects will significantly increase our understanding of how wild species are using aquaculture farms as a habitat type. It can help identify if and how shellfish beds and gear influence habitat availability."
