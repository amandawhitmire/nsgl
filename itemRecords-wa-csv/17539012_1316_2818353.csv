14,Abstract:,"Some fish stock assessments are conducted in regions that contain no-take marine reserves (NTMRs). NTMRs areexpected to lead to spatial heterogeneity in fish biomass by allowing a buildup of biomass inside their borders while fishingpressure occurs outside. Stock assessments do not typically account for spatial heterogeneity caused by NTMRs, which may leadto biased estimates of biomass. Simulation modeling is used to analyze the ability of several stock assessment configurations toestimate current biomass after the implementation of a single, large NTMR. Age-structured spatial operating models with threepatterns of ontogenetic movement are used to represent the “true” population dynamics. Results show that assessing populationsas a single stock with use of fishery catch-rate data and without accounting for the NTMR results in severe underestimation​of biomass for two of the movement patterns. Omitting fishery catch-rate data or allowing time-varying dome-shaped selectivityafte​r NTMR implementation leads to improved estimates of current biomass, but severe bias in estimated trends in biomass overtime. Performing separate assessments for fished areas and NTMRs leads to improved estimation performance in the absence ofmovement among assessment areas, but can severely overestimate biomass otherwise. Performing a spatial assessment withestimation of movement parameters among areas was found to be the best way to assess a species, even when movementpattern​s were unknown. However, future work should explore the performance of spatial assessments when catchability variesamong areas."
