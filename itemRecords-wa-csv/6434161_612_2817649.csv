11,Abstract:,"MIT Sea Grant College Program organized and hosted the 16th annual Blue Lobster Bowl (BLB) at MIT on March 3, 2013. The tournament included 126 participants from 12 Massachusetts high schools and was free and open to the public. MIT Sea Grant research scientists and partners also offered information to students on marine science and ocean engineering careers. The student teams were split into divisions and tested in classrooms across campus through quick-answer buzzer questions and thought-â€‹provoking team challenge questions. The history of the competition, and the rules and roles of officials are explained in the program. BLB question topics include marine biology, chemistry, geology, physics, navigation, geography, and related ocean history, literature, and public policy. In addition to the opportunity for the winning team to travel to the National Finals, teams vie for a variety of prizes, including money for study materials and educational trips. The BLB regional competition is part of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl (NOSB), which is a program of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership based in Washington, D.C. Through this educational forum, the NOSB strives to encourage and support the next generation of marine scientists, policy makers, teachers, explorers, researchers, technicians, environmental advocates and informed citizens, to be stewards of the ocean."
