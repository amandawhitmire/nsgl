12,Abstract:,"Nearshore hypoxia is an increasingly prevalent summertime phenomenon in the Northeast Pacific, assumed to originate from an oxygen minimum zone during upwelling. The occurrence of oxygen depletion and mortality of organisms with limited mobility is well established along the Oregon coast (2002, 2006 hypoxia events), but the extent of the effect on juvenile organisms is not well quantified. Oregon estuaries and nearshore environments are critical nursery grounds for several commercially and ecologically important fish and invertebrate assemblages. When protracted hypoxic conditions occur in these habitats, juveniles may be incapable of seeking areas of higher oxygen, like more mobile and hypoxia-​tolerant adults. Our project seeks to identify and model the cumulative effects of temperature and dissolved oxygen patterns on the growth of recently settled English sole Parophrys vetulus. We conducted three experiments with a range of temperatures (5 – 15°C) and dissolved oxygen parameters (1.5 – 8.0 ml/l) that may be experienced in Oregon nursery habitats. We hypothesized that the interactive effects of DO and temperature would be clearly identifiable: poor growth during warm T/low DO, optimal growth during warm T/high DO; reduced growth during all cold T/DO conditions. Results indicate that there was a T/DO interaction when comparing the first two experiments with similar temperatures. When compared separately however, only DO appeared to have an effect on the overall growth. During the third experiment, we increased the range of temperatures to a higher and lower extreme, and only found an effect of temperature on growth. Furthermore, we will model growth as an indicator of habitat quality. Our team is working to create a predictive model of post-settlement habitat quality that may be used to compare the experimental data to field measurements."
