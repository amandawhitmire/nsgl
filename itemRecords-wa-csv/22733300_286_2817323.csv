11,Abstract:,"The objective of this project is to increase economic resilience within the Ocean Shores community—speci​fically, to address the adverse effects created by seasonality associated with a tourism-​dependent economy. Economic resilience is broadly defined as a system’s ability to adjust to the ever-increasing frequency of economic, social, and environmental changes within its limitations, such as geographic location, population, and industry. The term applies to the economic characteristics of an area that influence its overall resilience to disruptions. It refers to outside shocks from economic depressions, shifts in national market trends, and natural disasters that can weaken the community’s ability to regain economic stability in the aftermath."
12,,"Mayor Crystal Dingler: First, I would like to thank the local citizens and business people who came together, meeting throughout the winter of 2019–2020, to help us develop the perspectives and ideas presented in this report. In addition, we were fortunate to have research efforts provided by Kevin Decker, PhD in Envi- ronmental Sciences; Dr. Decker’s time was generously provided to the project by the Washington Sea Grant program. Naomi Korchonoff, a graduate student from Evergreen State College, joined the project as an intern; she was paid by the City of Ocean Shores. Jacob Cravey, (MBA in Sustainable Systems, from Tree Ring Consult- ing, who works with The Nature Conservancy and its Coast Works Innovation Network), facilitated the group meetings, drawing forth ideas, information, and mem- ories through a variety of facilitation techniques, which kept the meetings lively and interesting."
