10,Abstract:,"On a warm, sunny fall day, rotting fish carcasses coated with thick gray fungus line streams throughout the Pacific Northwest. No, they're not the victims of a chemical spill or disease; rather these bodies are adult salmon that returned to the streams to lay their eggs and then die. Scientists are now finding that the carcasses of the adults are critical for the success of the plants and animals that live in and around those streams. This article describes the route of nutrients contained in the bodies of adult salmon through the food web, and how scientists are using this knowledge in light of declining wild salmon populations."
