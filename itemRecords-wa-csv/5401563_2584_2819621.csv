11,Abstract:,"Although there is ample evidence for pituitary regulation of the teleost thyroid, the study of the hypothalamic-​pituitary-​thyroid axis in teleost fish has been limited by the lack of purified fish thyrotropin (TSH), as well as by the insufficient development of sensitive and specific bioassays for fish TSH. This report describes the separation and preliminary biochemical characterizatio​n of coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") pituitary TSH and gonadotropin (GTH). Homologous bioassay systems using coho salmon or coho salmon tissues are utilized throughout the study."
