7,Abstract:,"What is a King Tide? The King Tide is the highest predicted high tide of the year. It is above the highest water level reached at high tide on an average day. King tides occur when the orbits and alignment of the Earth, moon and sun combine to produce the greatest tidal effects of the year."
