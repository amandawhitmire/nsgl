18,Abstract:,"This approach is applicable to signal transduction systems based on surface plasmon resonance, chemiluminescen​ce, fluorescence, and mass as well as other phenomena. The specific goal is to develop a general system that will allow for the systematic characterizatio​n of the effects of the affinity of the sensor specificity element for the target analyte, the effect of analyte mass on signal size, and the general performance of the sensor system with respect to sensitivity and selectivity. At the same time, this system should allow for the characterizatio​n of the distribution of biospecificity elements on the sensor surface."
