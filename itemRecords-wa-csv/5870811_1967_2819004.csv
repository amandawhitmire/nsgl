14,Abstract:,"DNase released from the fungus ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli"" (Fsph DNase) has previously been reported to induce pathogenesis-​related (PR) genes, phytoalexin accumulation and disease resistance against subsequent challenge with the true pea pathogen ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""pisi."" This paper describes the cloning of FSPH DNase and the use of nucleic acid probes and anti-Fsph DNase antisera in following the accumulation of RNA and the release of Fsph DNase in the first few hours of interaction. The function of extracellular DNases in fungi is most often viewed solely as a mechanism for recovering nutrients for the synthesis of nucleic acids. The authors examine the additional possibility that Fsph DNase damages host DNA and signals the induction of defense responses via this route."
