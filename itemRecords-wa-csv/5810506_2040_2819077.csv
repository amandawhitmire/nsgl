12,Abstract:,"Sensors based on the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) have been applied to a variety of applications, including immunoassay, chemical, gas, and thin-film sensing. The authors of this paper present the design and experimental verification for an SPR biosensor system using a second sensor channel for reference compensation during antibody-​antigen binding experiments. Using a lightpipe configuration SPR sensor with two sensor surfaces and flow cell volumes. They demonstrate the use of the second sensor channel to compensate for changes in the refractive index of the bulk solution."
