13,Abstract:,"Clonal full-sib progeny groups of Atlantic salmon ""Salmo salar"" x brown trout ""Salmo trutta"" hybrids were produced by gynogenesis. Eggs obtained from Atlantic salmon (female) x brown trout (male) F1 hybrids were activated with UV- irradiated rainbow trout ""Oncorhynchus mykiss"" sperm. Isogenicity was observed within progeny groups and to the maternal parent and also in the gynogenetic progeny of a third female spawned the following year. It appeared that a large portion of the oocytes in females of this hybrid underwent a premeiotic chromosome doubling or possibly a complete suppression of meiosis. The result was ovulation of diploid eggs, each possessing a full set of both Atlantic salmon and brown trout chromosomes identical to those in the maternal somatic cells. Lines of clonal hybrids could therefore be perpetuated by gynogenesis."
