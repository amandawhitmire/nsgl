17,Abstract:,"Historically, 25 percent of an average year's global corn production is held in inventories to buffer weather shocks and allow for a smooth consumption between years. As inventory levels are drawn down, prices increase, thereby giving farmers an incentive to increase production in the following years to refill depleted inventory levels. While individual countries might face significant production shocks, these idiosyncratic shocks average out over the globe. Global corn production shocks (deviations from a trend) ranged from -13 percent to + 7 percent in 1961to2010, with a standard deviation of 4percent (Roberts and Schlenker 2013). International trade smoothes production shocks between countries unless these countries institute export bans. There are, however, certain exceptions to this rule. The production of some crops is highly spatially correlated and subject to the same common weather shocks. A prime example is corn production in the United States, which is grown in the Midwest. Since the US produces roughly 40 percent of the world's corn, any impact to US production has the potential to significantly affect global production and global price levels."
