12,Abstract:,"The NOAA coastal Services Center has developed a web-based tool to support efforts in the Pacific Northwest to increase the resilience of ports and harbors to earthquakes and tsunamis. The web site consists of two major components: a Cascadia regional risk atlas that addresses the seismic hazards that are most prevalent; and the ports and harbors planning process being developed by Oregon and Washington Sea Grant, for reducing the impact of seismic hazards. This paper presents details of the project's development and a case study of the planning process using Yaquina Bay, Oregon."
