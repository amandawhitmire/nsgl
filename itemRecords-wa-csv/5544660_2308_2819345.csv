11,Abstract:,"Japan's role in the Alaskan king crab market has changed dramatically over the past two decades; Japan is now the primary determinant of king crab wholesale prices. This paper identifies the contributing factors. Two models are presented: the first is useful in predicting Japanese wholesale price, FOB Alaska; the second model predicts Japanese demand for Alaskan king crab. Japan and the U.S. wholesale markets operate in a recursive fashion, with Japan entering the market first. This type of market segmentation virtually precludes arbitraging behavior, and early entry provides substantial benefits to processors. Model results indicate that processors properly focus on exchange rate movements; results also suggest that U.S. processors should be concerned with the steady growth in Soviet crab exports to Japan."
