10,Abstract:,"In this timely study, the author discusses the confluence of two well established lines of research aimed at understanding variability in marine pelagic populations and communities. 'Webs' refers to food webs in the plankton, the linkages between groups of organisms based on what eats what. 'Scales' refers both to ranges of space and time and to the ecology of larval fish, most of which are planktivorous, and their recruitment to adult populations. Drawing upon years of research into the ecology of marine plankton, Mullin offers, by example and opinion, a personal yet authoritative slant on the continuing debate about the most effective ways to understand biological variability in the ocean."
