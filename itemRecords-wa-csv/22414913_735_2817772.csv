15,Abstract:,"As reported in the previous UNJR-CEST Joint Meeting, we are mapping the patch and landscape structure of intertidal and shallow subtidal eelgrass (Zostera marina) in Pacific Northwest estuaries using high spatial resolution hyperspectral remotely sensed image data. Our primary purpose in these studies is to understand potential limiting factors on the success of juvenile summer chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) rearing and migration along estuarine and nearshore marine shorelines, and how natural and anthropogenic factors affect eelgrass patch/landscape structure."
