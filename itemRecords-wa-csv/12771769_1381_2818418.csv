9,Abstract:,"The short-tailed albatross is an endangered species, with fewer than 4,000 found in the North Pacific. As a result, recent management actions call for West Coast groundfish fisheries to help protect these birds. These fisheries, including all gear types, can take no more than two short-tailed albatross in a two-year period. Fishermen should also avoid catching the more common black-footed albatross, because their bycatch numbers will factor into management policy."
