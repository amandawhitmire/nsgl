The Pacific Coast, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Puget Sound all have geologic evidence for past tsunamis, and future tsunamis are inevitable. This fact sheet contains information for Washington State residents and visitors, including how tsunamis form, the different sources of tsunamis that affect Washington coastlines and what you should do in the event of a tsunami."
