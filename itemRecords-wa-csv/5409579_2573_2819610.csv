11,Abstract:,"One of the approaches to implementing nori aquaculture in the Pacific Northwest is to develop cultivation methods for use with native species of the red seaweed ""Porphyra"". Five of the seventeen native species of ""Porphyra have been identified as having the qualities which make high quality nori. Research is concentrating on (1) establishing laboratory cultures of the conchocelis stages of potential cultivars, (2) defining the environmental conditions under which quantities of conchospores suitable for net seeding can be obtained from such cultures, and (3) seeding test nets for use in field growth tests of these native ""Porphyra"" species. Suitable conchospore production has been obtained with several strains of ""P. torta"" and successful field growth trials have been initiated. The progress of this research is reported in this paper."
