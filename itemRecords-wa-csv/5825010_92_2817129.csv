11,Abstract:,"In 1997, the Southeast and Gulf state's Sea Grant programs implemented the Sea Grant HazNet program. This effort was undertaken realizing that research, education, and outreach programs were needed to employ the most effective means to reduce loss of life and to mitigate the impacts of various coastal hazards. The effort is currently in its second year of funding, with the following components in place or in the process of being implemented: design and produce a HazNet Website; assess hazards research needs; establish a listserver with members of industry, and government offices and other interested users; and plan and develop educational programs for the general public and precollege students and their teachers. Research presented in this report summarizes efforts to utilize the educational potential of the World Wide Web for the transfer of educational materials for classroom teachers. Under the umbrella of the Sea Grant HazNet program, researchers identified and organized materials available at a variety of URLs on the World Wide Web and have made them available at the national HazNet Web site."
