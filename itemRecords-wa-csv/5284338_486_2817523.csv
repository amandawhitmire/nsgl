10,Abstract:,"The most frequently asked question concerning recreational boating is: How many boats are there in Washington State? Or Puget Sound? The need behind that question usually relates to moorage. Typically, a marina consultant under contract to a public port authority or a private marina developer is attempting to estimate demand for a proposed marina somewhere in coastal Washington. Investors, developers, and port officials need to know the state of the market in their service area, how many s'lips are likely to fill over what period of time, and at what rental rate. Municipal and county planning staff and their elected officials are similarly concerned about demand for moorage. These local government planning agencies must allocate scarce shoreline space among a number of competing land and water uses. State and federal resource management agencies, especially those with mandates to conserve fish and wildlife habitat and maintain or improve water quality, are understandably reluctant to permit displacement or deterioration of those resources where significant need for moorage facilities cannot be demonstrated. Other state and federal agencies administer 1 and acquisition and development grant s for pub 1 i c outdoor recreation facilities. The Interagency Committee for Outdoor Recreation (IAC) prepares the State-wide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP), a document which is used to guide disbursements of federal and state outdoor recreation funds. Information on moorage demand at the level of the individual county can augment the more aggregated boating facilities needs analyses contained in the 1979 SCORP update. Because users, managers, and stewards of Washington's coastal zone resources all share an interest in the future of the moorage industry, their representatives were asked to, and willingly did, participate in an ad hoc advisory committee convened to assist researchers in conducting the study reported here. The Smallcraft Harbors Research Advisory Group (SCHRAG) met frequently between 1977 and 1981 to help scope the project, critique interim products, and review draft reports. Their continued participation will assure dissemination of results and implementation of recommendations where appropriate."
