9,Abstract:,"Strategic planning provides a tool for distinguishing between solid opportunities and latent disasters and a rationale for acceptance or rejection of potential opportunities. This publication provides an overview of strategic planning and management planning for public port authority executives. It provides information on what has and has not worked for ports that have been involved in a strategic planning effort. It is also written for the port authority that wants to initiate a strategic planning effort or is contemplating some form of management planning. During a 27-month period, a study was conducted to examine how public port authorities undertake strategic planning efforts. Board members, executive directors, consultants, and customers were interviewed. The results are incorporated here."
