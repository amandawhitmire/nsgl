10,Abstract:,"Growth rates of ""Cancer magister"" have been shown to be substantially slower in colder nearshore coastal water compared to that of animals in estuaries; depressed respiration rates should be a concomitant cold-​temperature response. Along the shoreline of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, siblings of a year class may recruit to different habitats, within an estuary or along the coast, that represent highly divergent environmental features over a short linear distance. Grays Harbor estuary along the southern coast of Washington State is a location where juvenile crab would benefit from higher summer temperatures, greater productivity, and more refuge than found in the nearshore coastal region. This study was designed to determine the extent to which metabolism is temperature-​dependent across a size range of juvenile crab occuring in the estuary and nearshore. Results are interpreted in light of temperature differences between oceanic and estuarine habitats and between two age classes that occur in both locations."
