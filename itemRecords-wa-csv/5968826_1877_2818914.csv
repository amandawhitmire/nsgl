12,Abstract:,"In this study, the authors used 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis to follow changes in bacterial diversity in subseafloor fluids from a single diffuse flow vent shortly after a volcanic eruption created the site in 1998 and again in 1999 and 2000. Over this time period, these diffuse flow fluids showed marked variation in temperature, flow rates, chemical characteristicsâ€‹, and extent of mixing of hydrothermal fluids and seawater. Results show that bacterial diversity is high in diffuse fluids, and that it changes with the post-eruptive evolution of vent fluid chemistry and temperature. The data also show increases in species richness with time within the epsilon- proteobacteria, the dominant phylotype found to be unique to the subseafloor environment. A preliminary model is presented that attempts to relate bacterial and archaeal diversity to chemical characteristics of diffuse flow fluids and the degree of mixing of seawater."
