12,Abstract:,"Empirical evidence links salmon-derived nutrients to riparian vegetation production and quality, but mechanisms regulating transformation of salmon tissues into plant tissues are still largely unknown. We measured salmon carcass nutrient contributions to riparian soils of Kennedy Creek, WA, a coastal rainforest system. We used ion exchange resins to estimate cumulative bioavailability of major ions in soils, arid soil extracts to examine timing and lateral movement of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3- from carcasses. Over the period of skeletonization (76 days), bioavailability of NH4+ was approx. 250x, soluble P(primarily PO4^-2) was approx. 2x, and sulfur (SOx) was approx. 5x higher than baseline within 20 cm of carcasses, while availability of other ions was not affected. Maximum NH4+ and NO3- within 10 cm of carcasses occurred at approx. 240 degree days (dd; 56 days). NO3- and NH4+ maxima 20 and 50 cm from carcasses occurred between 300 dd (70 days) and 600 dd (150 days). When protected from large scavengers, an average minimum of 49.3% of total carcass N was contributed to soils, and NH4+ and NO3- moved through soils laterally at least 50 cm. Approximately 97% of salmon N is in quickly decaying soft tissues, while 88% of Ca and 50% of P is in the slowly decaying skeleton. Different lag-times in bioavailability of nutrients result; NH4+ becomes bioavailable within weeks, NO3- within months, and P and Ca^+2 over months to years. These findings provide a potential timing mechanism for feedbacks between salmon and riparian vegetation in the context of local conditions."
