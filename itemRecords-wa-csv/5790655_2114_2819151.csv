13,Abstract:,"Retention of trawl-caught Pacific halibut is prohibited in U.S. coastal waters. Therefore, trawl-caught halibut are discarded at sea. Objectives of this research were to refine discard-​mortality estimates, identify fishing and handling practices that may reduce mortality of discarded individuals, and develop a model that can be used to predict halibut discard-​mortality over a broad range of conditions. Factors that significantly affected halibut mortality included towing duration, amount of time out of water, body size, and air temperature. One of the most pronounced factors affecting mortality was the condition of the catch. Mortality often reached 100% when substantial amounts of sand were mixed with the catch."
