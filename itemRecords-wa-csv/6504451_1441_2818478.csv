9,Abstract:,"Numerical models are increasingly important for planning and permitting of marine fish farms. Models range from simple one-box simulations to complex mainframe-​oceanic models potentially capable of managing entire coastal systems. AquaModel is an advanced information system to assess the operations and impacts of fish farms in both water column and benthic environments, the first of its kind."
