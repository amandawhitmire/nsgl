10,Abstract:,"The US West Coast groundfish fishery is a mixed-species fishery, with landings obtained primarily by trawl gear. In recognition of the increasing pressure on the multispecies resources a stringent management regime was put into effect during the early 1980s which included the institution of annual and trip quotas for individual species. A number of concerns have been raised about this complex regime. This paper briefly reviews the results of studies in the mid-1980s, their implications for groundfish fishery management, and their impacts on further research directions. Preliminary results of an ongoing study primarily aimed at assessing the potential for gear restrictions to improve management of the fishery are presented, along with descriptions of future work planned, and some general challenges faced by those involved in research and management of mixed-species fisheries."
