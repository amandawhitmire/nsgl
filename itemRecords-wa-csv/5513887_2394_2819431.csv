12,Abstract:,"Restriction fragment patterns of genomic DNA of rainbow trout hybridized with radiolabeled bacteriophage M13 DNA, were examined to assess the utility of this probe for detecting genetic polymorphisms in unrelated individuals. A high level of polymorphism was found for restriction fragment lengths by analysis of DNA from a single-pair mating between individuals of an outbred strain of this species. Each of the offspring of this mating exhibited a unique banding pattern. Similar polymorphic patterns were found in chum salmon ""Oncorynchus keta,"" coho salmon ""O. kisutch,"" and Atlantic salmon ""Salmo salar."" This technique shows great promise for demographic analysis and unambiguous genetic tagging of individual fish."
