9,Abstract:,"After experiencing mooring failures on August 19, in which a number of net pens broke loose from their anchor according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Cooke Aquaculture’s Cypress Farm #2 facility suffered major structural damage the following day. Roughly 305,000 Atlantic salmon had been stocked into the facility, and although the company has ultimately accounted for 145,851 of the ﬁsh, numerous reports of escaped salmon continue to come into a website set up by the Washington Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Many of the 10-lb escapees may never be accounted for. While the question has been raised as to whether these large escapees from the Cooke operation might have a better chance of surviving in the wild, as compared to smaller escapees or juvenile ﬁsh that were intentionally stocked in the past, research generally conﬁrms that farmed Atlantic salmon are ill-adapted to sustain themselves when forced to forage in the wild. Recent research out of the University of Melbourne suggests that many farmed salmon also suffer from hearing loss, which could signiﬁcantly reduce their ability to capture wild prey and elude predators."
