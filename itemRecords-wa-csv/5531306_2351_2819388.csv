14,Abstract:,"In nature, chitosan is a component of the walls of some pathogenic fungi. After chitosan was found to possess biological properties crucial for resistance in some plant/pathogen interactions, efforts were made to develop practical utilizations for these properties and concomitantly generate demand for this compound which is commercially available from the chitin of crustacean shell wastes. The quickest approach for full utilization of chitosan's biological properties probably resides in research directed toward understanding how chitosan, as a polycationic polymer, interacts with a multiplicity of cellular components to influence cell regulation. However, some progress in developing chitosan seed treatments has been realized by observing beneficial effects via direct application trials. Current levels of understanding and applied research are described here."
