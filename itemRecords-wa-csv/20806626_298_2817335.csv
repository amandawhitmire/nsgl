14,Abstract:,"Since the mid-1990s commercial fishermen have used earlier editions of this publication to think through the issues involved in selling their catches through a nontraditional distribution system. This is commonly called direct marketing or alternative marketing. Hundreds of fishermen have used the manual and many have said they found it helpful. Some readers have suggested improvements and we’ve attempted to incorporate those suggestions into this edition. We have invited new contributors and incorporated insights from working direct marketers. We have included new material on branding, products, product placement, promotion, and use of social media, among other topics.The fifth edition has new sections on accounting, e-commerce, working with custom processors, insurance, and more. The state and federal permits and regulations sections have been updated. What is Direct Marketing? Times are changing in the fishing and seafood industries. Demand for seafood is increasing. A strong dollar is making American seafood more expensive abroad. Fuel prices are down, at least for now, but other costs are up. Technology is making fish harvesting, processing and distribution more efficient and more competitive. Online purchasing and social media are changing the ways people find and purchase goods. Ocean climate change is altering patterns of resource abundance, distribution and behaviors. People want to feel more of a connection with their food and know its source. Competition in the marketplace among food choices is increasing. Change brings threats and opportunities. One way a fishing business can respond to both is to get more money for the product it sells. ""Direct marketing"" means selling the catch at some point further up the distribution or ""value-adding"" chain from the usual destination—the local seafood processing plant. A direct marketer can sell directly to the consumer, or to a buyer at any other level in the system. It means getting paid for the value of the raw product but also any value that is accrued as it is processed, packaged, transported and sold to the final user or consumer. This is often called ""bypassing the middleman"" but really it is ""becoming the middleman."" It means doing jobs, incurring the expenses and taking the risks of all those middlemen and, hopefully, getting paid what each of those links of the chain otherwise would reap individually."
