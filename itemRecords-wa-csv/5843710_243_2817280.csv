9,Abstract:,"The invasion of aquatic nuisance species (ANS) has been identified as one of the most severe environmental threats facing the marine waters of the Pacific Northwest. The ecological and economic impacts have been significant. Of most concern are the more recently established ANS, the European green crab (""Carcinus maenas""), the Chinese mitten crab (""Eriocheir sinensis""), and the New Zealand mud snail (""Potamopyrgus antipodarum""). Oregon Sea Grant supports a project studying the distribution and abundance of nonindigenous and native aquatic species in San Francisco Bay and Pacific Northwest estuaries. In addition, Oregon and Washington Sea Grant have developed the Pacific Northwest Marine Invasive Species Team, whose role, among other things, is to coordinate information sharing among groups at all levels of involvement and focus research and outreach in the areas of greatest need."
