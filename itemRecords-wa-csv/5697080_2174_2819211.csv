12,Abstract:,"Previous attempts to explain substantial interannual variability in ""Cancer magister"" abundance have been largely unsuccessful. This study examined the relationship between advective transport of larvae and subsequent ""C. magister"" year-class strength along the southern Washington coast. Data from trawl surveys of recently settled crab were used to measure year-class strength, thus minimizing potentially confounding effects associated with long time-lags (as required with commercial landings data). Results suggest that strong landward transport is conductive to heavy ""C magister"" settlement. This conditon will tend to minimize cross-shelf advective loss of larvae while promoting retention near suitable juvenile and adult habitat. Strong alongshore Ekman transport, on the other hand, was apparently detrimental to ""C. magister"" recruitment. This latter effect has not been described previously and represent a signficant departure from conventional thinking about the dynamics of ""C. magister"" larvae (which focuses almost exclusively on the cross-shelf component of the coastal circulation."
