9,Abstract:,"The author's work suggests that the nonindigenous cordgrass, ""Spartina anglica,"" is changing the nature of Puget Sound shorelines in which it invades. The potential for removal and restoration of native communities is uncertain and likely depends on the community considered. Future research will concentrate on post-removal community structure and restoration potential."
