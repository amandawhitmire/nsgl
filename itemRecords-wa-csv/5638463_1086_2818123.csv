11,Abstract:,"Successful commercial fish farming depends on the operator's understanding of genetics and selective breeding principles. Selective breeding of fish stocks can improve growth rates and disease resistance, and prevent inbreeding or other negative genetic consequences. Stock enhancement programs can use these principles to manage resources and maintain genetic variation, while conservation programs can use the principles to evaluate and maintain genetic diversity of wild stocks. Three aspects of selective breeding of fishes are reviewed in this volume: selective breeding to improve fish performace for aquaculture, genetic resource management for stock enhancement and conservation of natural genetic resources."
