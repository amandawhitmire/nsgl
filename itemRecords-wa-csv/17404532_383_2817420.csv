8,Abstract:,"Since its inception in 2003, NOAA Science Camp has evolved into a highly regarded, collaborative science program. It introduces middle-school youth, high school and undergraduate-​level camp assistants and graduate-level educators to the multidisciplina​ry nature of research. Scientists and educators interact directly with camp participants to demonstrate how National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) research addresses environmental issues on both local and national scales. NOAA, two programs from the University of Washington (UW): the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO), Washington Sea Grant (WSG), and camper fees provide financial support. Participation and partnership are keys to NOAA Science Camp’s success. The camp involves several NOAA offices and two NOAA-funded programs at the UW, including scientists and education staff that develop activities and interact with the campers. NOAA Science Camp also works with partners to recruit campers from underserved communities."
