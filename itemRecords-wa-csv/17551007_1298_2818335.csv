9,Abstract:,"Ecological carrying capacity is the maximum extractive pressure that does not cause unacceptable change in the ecosystem. The Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) modeling framework provides a way to visualize the biomass of a suite of species groups over time, using mortality rates or ‘production’ of species groups, food intake and diet composition."
