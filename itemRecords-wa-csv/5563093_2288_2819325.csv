9,Abstract:,"Luminous bacteria, like all other naturally occurring free-living marine bacteria, can be found on marine fishes. These bacteria are often unknowingly ingested by consumers on a variety of products because they are not present in sufficient quantities to create a distinct glow. There are no harmful effects from consuming them since luminescent bacteria are not human pathogens. The presence of luminous bacteria does not necessarily indicate that a product is decomposed. It does, however, alert the processor or purchaser to the fact that the product may not have been handled properly since the same conditions under which luminous bacteria multiply also foster the growth of other bacteria that can cause decomposition. Thus it is necessary to examine other attributes of the product to determine if it is wholesome and not harboring harmful microorganisms."
