13,Abstract:,"Students thinking about careers in the marine sciences often picture themselves working with marine mammals. However, only a few marine scientists specialize in that area. This second edition of ""Marine Science Careers"" introduces a wide range of marine career fields, and to people working in them. In addition, it gives those men and women a chance to say what they like and dislike about their careers, what they see for the future in their fields, and more."
