12,Abstract:,"A quantitative understanding of cross-shore hydrodynamics and sediment transport mechanics is essential for proper coastal erosion control. Empirical models for predicting beach and dune erosion by storm surge are easy to apply and could eventually be extended to simulate long-term shoreline erosion or accretion if the recovery processes of the eroded beach and dune following the storm could be quantified. In this paper, a numerical flow model for predicting monochromatic or transient wave transformation and swash oscillation on a beach is extended to predict random wave transformation in the surf and swash zones. The model predicts the quantities related to the irregular free surface oscillations reasonably well; however, the computed depth-averaged velocities are found to be at best in qualitative agreement with the undertow and odd moments of the horizontal velocities measured at 5 cm above the bottom."
