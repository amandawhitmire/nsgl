9,Abstract:,"A new genus and species of deep-sea medusa, ""Vampyrocrossot​a childressi"", is described from the eastern North Pacific. It has been found in San Clemente Basin off Baja California, Mexico, and from the waters off Point Conception, California, at depths between 600 and 1475 m. This genus is allied to the cosmopolitan rhopalonematid genus ""Crossota"", but differs notably in the shape and position of the gonads. It is the only described species of hydromedusa with black pigmentation."
