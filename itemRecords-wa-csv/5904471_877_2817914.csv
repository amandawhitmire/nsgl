10,Abstract:,"In a recent hot dry summer in Rhode Island, many communities put into effect water use bans prohibiting, for example, the watering of lawns. Around Washington County, hand-painted signs sprouted in front of houses, declaring ""Not on Town Water."" The sign painters wanted passers-by to know that the sprinklers watering their green lawns were okay-ï¿½they were not covered by the watering bans. But these sign painters were missing the point. Ground water is the only source of water for Washington County; whether a well is owned by the town or a single household, the water comes from the same place. This publication of 13 brief essays and reports examines the issues surrounding sources of fresh water and how we use it."
