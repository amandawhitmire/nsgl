13,Abstract:,"Washington's shellfish don't only give delicious delights, they provide jobs central to our economy. They also support healthy nature, providing important ecosystem services like filtering water and creating habitats. Side by side with businesses, communities, public and private sectors, we're restoring the strength of Washington's shellfish, in native ecosystems and on sustainable farms. As we undertake these efforts, science and technology are our springboards. Our work in Washington is a first step to understanding how different types of aquaculture function and how they may accelerate ecosystem recovery.Our changing climate also poses new threats to shellfish, particularly with rising acidity in the ocean. We are proud to raise our voice with the Shellfish Growers’ Climate Coalition, which calls for attention to the impacts of climate change on nature and people. You can explore the Shellfish Growers' Climate Coalition, learn about ocean acidification, shellfish aquaculture, sustainable aquaculture for nature and people, and more on this website."
