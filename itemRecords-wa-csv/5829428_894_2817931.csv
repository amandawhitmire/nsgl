11,Abstract:,"The mild climate and an abundance of sheltered bays and inlets help Puget Sound support one of the largest recreational boating communities in the country. Puget Sound's designation as an estuary of national significance as well as the prominence of its commercial shellfish industry has also focused significant attention on the Sound's water quality. Activities associated with recreational boating and marina operations are receiving attention for how they might better operate in a manner sensitive to maintaining clean water. This paper describes a skills-based approach used in water quality workshops for recreational boaters, conducted as a part of the Washington Sea Grant Program's Sound Boater Program."
