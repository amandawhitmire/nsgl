9,Abstract:,"Most of the annual variability in sockeye salmon (""Oncorhynchus nerka"") survival has been assumed to be associated with freshwater stages, while marine survival has been assumed to be very consistent from year to year. Data from Lake Washington sockeye salmon stock, including hydroacoustic surveys of presmolt populations, indicate that marine survival may vary on the order of 4-20%. However, the data also show that river flow conditions during spawning and gravel incubation have a major effect on production for this stock."
