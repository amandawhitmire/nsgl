12,Abstract:,"The use of bivalve shellfish in Puget Sound is restricted by a natural phenomenon, the production of toxins by the dinoflagellate ""Gonyaulax catenella."" Shellfish ingest this species and accumulate the toxins. When humans consume shellfish containing sufficient toxin, paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) can result. Recent research in eastern Canada has indicated that finfish resources in many areas may also be at risk from these toxins. The purpose of the field and laboratory work report ed in this paper was two-fold: (1) to determine conditions which control growth and accumulation of ""G. catenella"" and (2) to study the effect of the toxins on finfish in Puget Sound."
