16,Abstract:,"Demersal fish populations were sampled on a quarterly basis in and around a proposed dredge disposal site in Port Gardner, Washington. The proposed disposal site (110 m to 120 m in depth) appeared typical of other locations within Puget Sound at similar depths, with lower abundance, biomass, species diversity, and species richness when compared to shallower depths within the study area. Recommendations for monitoring the site after the onset of disposal are offered."
