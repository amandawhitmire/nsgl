10,,"During the winter and spring of 1990, Washington Sea Grant conducted a mail survey of all known marinas in Washington State. Included were questions about market conditions facing the marina operator: moorage lease rates in summer and winter, seasonal occupancy rates, and numbers of boaters on waiting lists. This report presents the results including, in addition to market information, a summary of each region's stock of moorage, a list of the facilities that provide it, and the quantity and kind of moorage slips they lease or rent."
