8,Abstract:,"Georgia lags far behind states such as Washington, Hawaii and Florida, in initiating and facilitating the interjurisdicti​onal transfers of fish upon which a viable aquaculture industry depends. Some citizens have experienced great losses and limitations as a result of that cautious policy. However, in embracing the Procedural Plan components of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commision Draft report, the state has indicated, at least preliminarily, its preferred approach to the many problems that will arise from aquaculture-​related activities. Much work, both political and scientific, remains to be done before Georgia develops an aquaculture industry that requires or depends upon interstate transfers."
