13,Abstract:,"We explored the effects of larval dispersal distance on the impact of no-take marine reserves (NTMRs) implemented in fisheries with catch regulations. NTMRs exist in many fisheries with harvest regulated by annual catch limits. In these fisheries, catch is taken from outside NTMRs, potentially resulting in reduced abundance outside NTMRs and an overall reduction in catch. We used a spatial model with two life stages (larvae and adults) to evaluate the effects of larval dispersal distance for fisheries managed by a total allowable catch (TAC) and an NTMR. We examined effects of the timing of density-​dependent mortality in relation to larval movement. Abundance reached similar values for populations with long and short larval dispersal distances. Catch declined substantially for stocks with short larval dispersal distances. When larval dispersal distances were long, catch declined to values below maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but stabilized. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined to 9% of CPUE at MSY for stocks with short distance larval dispersal after the implementation of an NTMR; with long distance larval dispersal, CPUE declined to approximately 50% or less of the CPUE at MSY. The CPUE did not reflect trends in abundance after the implementation of an NTMR."
