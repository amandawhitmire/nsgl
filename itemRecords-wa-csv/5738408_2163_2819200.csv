12,Abstract:,"To date, there have been no microsatellite loci cloned from or applied to genetic analysis in cutthroat trout. However, at many microsatellite loci, the priming sequences flanking the tandem repeat motifs themselves are conserved among related taxa. Therefore, microsatellite primers derived from one species may be used to amplify homologous loci in related species or genera. This may eliminate the need for time-consuming and expensive development of primer sequences from each species of interest, and makes possible evolutionary comparisons of repeat sizes and variability among species. Here the authors explore the possiblity of applying microsatellite primers developed from other salmonids to coastal cutthroat trout and steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout."
