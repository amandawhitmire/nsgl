10,Abstract:,"The Port of Seattle's Shilshole Bay Marina and Fishermen's Terminal, with their combined fleets of twenty-two hundred boats, constitute two of the largest and most important recreational and commercial terminals in the Puget Sound area. Like all marinas, however, they have a problem with the proper disposal of plastic and other wastes generated by the fleets that use their facilities. The Port of Seattle has taken steps to alleviate the situation by improving the waste collection facilities to include recycling stations, and by helping to educate the boaters and commercial fishermen who use their terminals. This pamphlet describes the effort, which is applicable to any commercial or recreational port facility."
