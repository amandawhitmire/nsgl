9,Abstract:,"North Carolina's Coastal Plains are a water and land resource that can bring additional economic value to communities there through the expansion of ecotourism industries. A research conference held in 2001 was convened to explore issues related to the development of the water trails system for canoeing, kayaking, and the like. Thirteen research papers are presented in these proceedings authored by a variety of people whose professional careers involve recreation and water-based activities. The economics, planning, communication, values, conflicting interests, and impacts related to tourism are addressed."
