8,Abstract:,"Washington’s diverse and productive salt marshes and pocket estuaries, already threatened by shoreline development and pollution, now face a potentially destructive invader. The European green crab (Carcinus maenas) is considered one of the world’s worst invasive species. It can alter shoreline ecosystems and negatively impact economically important species."
