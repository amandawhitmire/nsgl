11,Abstract:,"Researchers isolated the first microsatellite loci in geoduck clams (""Panopea abrupta"") as part of an investigation into the genetic diversity of geoduck populations. Mono- or di-allelic PCR profiles were observed at six loci and all were polymorphic. Analysis of heterozygote deficiencies revealed significant deficiencies at four loci. Whether these deficiencies result from null alleles or nonrandom mating is under investigation."
