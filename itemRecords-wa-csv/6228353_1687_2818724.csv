15,Abstract:,"Biotic trends along estuarine gradients can be affected by co-varying processes ranging from large-scale oceanographic to local-scale physico-​chemical effects. As a baseline for future process studies, we investigated the distinct gradients in species richness and biomass in pebble-sand shorelines along the estuarine axis of Puget Sound, and the scales of variation of some of their physical correlates. Higher richness and biomass at beaches at the more marine end of the Sound are temporally consistent and seen in all trophic groups. Variables that correlate with biotic patterns include relatively subtle increases in beach surface and sediment temperatures and decreases in nearshore salinity near the head of the estuary, but not more localized parameters such as sediment grain size or pore water salinity. To understand whether these variables are true forcing functions of community structure, we are performing experimental work."
