15,Abstract:,"Bacterial kidney disease (BKD), caused by ""Renibacterium salmoninarum"", is among the most important bacterial diseases affecting Pacific and Atlantic salmon worldwide. ""R. salmoninarum"" is efficiently transmitted from adult to progeny inside the egg and from fish to fish through the water providing little opportunity to break the cycle of infection. The major soluble antigen of ""R. salmoninarum"" is a heat-stable, soluble protein that is serologically simular among all isolates tested. The relationships between this important protein and other virulence factors or extracellular products are beginning to be investigated. Reported here is the sequence of the gene coding for the 57-kDa antigen."
