11,Abstract:,"This report presents the findings from a national climate-change adaptation survey conducted by eight Sea Grant programs across the U.S. (Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois-​Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington). The survey was developed to understand the opinions, current phase of planning, and information needs of coastal/resourc​e professionals and elected officials regarding climate change and adaptation to it. Results from the survey indicate that most coastal/resourc​e professionals seem to believe climate change is occurring in their area. Flooding and shoreline change are important topics to most of the participant programs, and lack of agreement over climate-change effects is a hurdle encountered by many participants. Participating programs are using the survey results to assist communities with adaptation."
