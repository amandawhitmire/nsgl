17,Abstract:,"The removal of impassable dams can affect stream fish communities in many ways, including allowing previously separated anadromous and resident life history types to intermingle. Recolonization of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (anadromous Rainbow Trout) into areas that were previously occupied solely by resident conspecifics presents a challenge for monitoring because (1) staging or spawning adults may be difficult to directly observe; and (2) the offspring of the two life history forms are indistinguishab​le during early life. We evaluated the utility of using redd attributes, fry (age-0) size, and fry density to distinguish the presence of steelhead and Rainbow Trout in the Elwha River, Washington. Redd area and substrate size differed between forms: steelhead redds were significantly larger and had a greater median substrate particle size than Rainbow Trout redds. Fry density was significantly higher in steelhead spawning reaches than in Rainbow Trout reaches during both survey years (2010 and 2011). Steelhead fry tended to be slightly larger than Rainbow Trout fry but not significantly so in either year. Additionally, otolith microchemical analyses indicated that all fry collected from newly colonized habitat were of steelhead maternal origin, and these fish were intermediate in size to the steelhead and Rainbow Trout fry collected prior to dam removal. Thus, fry size may not effectively differentiate parental origin despite the tendency of anadromous parents to be larger and to spawn earlier than residents. Redd attributes and fry density may be useful for evaluating the spatial distributions and relative abundances of steelhead and Rainbow Trout after dam removal. Our results have implications for other dam removal projects and other monitored species."
