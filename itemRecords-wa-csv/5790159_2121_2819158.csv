10,Abstract:,"The objective of this manual is to describe to biologists with little or no background in cryobiology the basic steps in freezing salmonid sperm, the different options available in cryopreserving fish sperm, and the known strengths and weaknesses of each method. The first part describes procedures for the cryopreservatio​n of sperm using semen straws in liquid nitrogen vapor, storing sperm for extended time periods in liquid nitrogen, and retrieving and thawing the frozen material for use. Alternative methods are presented at the end of the document. The recipes for the solutions used in the manual and a list of possible vendors are also provided."
