11,Abstract:,"Selectivity, defined as differences in the probabilities of fish of different sizes being retained by the gear once they have encountered it, plays an important role in fisheries assessment and management. In trawl fisheries, gear selectivity arises mainly from the ability of some fish to pass through the open meshes of the codend netting and is described by sigmoidal, often symmetrical, curves showing the proportions of fish retained at each length by a particular mesh size. Usually, these mesh selection curves are summarized for convenience by the length at which 50% of the fish are retained, also known as 50% retention lengths. This paper computes linear regressions for 50% retention lengths and mesh sizes from published results of selectivity experiments performed on 12 gadoid species, and estimates the predictive power and coefficient of determination for each regression. The usefulness of such regressions for predictive purposes is discussed."
