10,Abstract:,"Chitosan and its derivatives showed maximal activities in both antifungal action and pisatin induction, while chitin and chitin derivatives showed no antifungal activity and only weak pisatin formation activity, indicating that high-​molecular-​weight chitosan fragments are more active in both antifungal and pisatin formation activity than are the intermediate and low-​molecular-​weight fragments. The chitosan oligomers which most effectively induce pisatin and inhibit ""Fusarium"" spp. are the non-acetylated heptamers."
