14,Abstract:,"This paper characterizes the market for ornamental marine life collected in Florida using data from an industry reporting system. Information was obtained on the value and harvest levels of individual species, changes in the number and location of fishing areas, and the numbers of industry participants. Statistics on the local industry are compared to trends in total U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service trade data. Wholesalers provide opinions regarding the advantages and disadvantages of Florida-caught marine life species."
