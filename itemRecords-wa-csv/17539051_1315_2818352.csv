15,Abstract:,"Spatial management measures are currently being used to manage bycatch anddiscards, given the spatial heterogeneity of fish distributions. However, permanentfishin​g closures are often poorly implemented, unresponsive to stock dynamics anddo not achieve their management objectives. Recently, real-time spatial managementtools for managing bycatch and discards implemented under either a comanagementor self-governance approach have been introduced in Europe and the US.Real-time catch and discard information is shared among fishers to incentivise andencourage vessels to leave areas of high bycatch. Here, the similarities and differences,in governance, implementation and management of ten real-time spatialmanageme​nt systems from across Europe and the US are reviewed. A framework isdeveloped to characterize the attributes associated with voluntary, private and regulatoryreal-​time spatial management tools. Challenges and management practicesin the different case studies are reviewed providing insights for designing these spatialmanageme​nt tools. The results illustrate that real-time spatial managementappro​aches can create incentives for fishers to develop, use and share informationand technology to avoid undesired catch. Compared with Europe, the US has developedspatia​l management tools with more truly real-time mechanisms and withgreater involvement of the fishing industry in designing and operating the tools."
