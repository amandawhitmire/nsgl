9,Abstract:,"The Advisory Committee to the Ocean Resources Assessment Program (ORAP) was created to help Washington Sea Grant (WSG) identify information gaps and research needs relevant to federal lease sales for offshore oil and gas exploration and development, scheduled by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) in April 1992. From the charge to the committee: `The State's actual information gaps and research needs would depend greatly on what types of operations, equipment, and facilities would be used onshore and offshore by industry, during all phases of oil and gas extraction. Thus a successful study must tap diverse sources of data and information about industry operations, equipment, and facilities, while not presupposing state policy alternatives about whether and how to encourage, discourage, or control oil and gas leasing. To do this, the committee will conduct case studies of hypothetical exploration, development, production, and distribution scenarios for oil and gas off the Pacific coast of Washington.' Committee members wanted to collect their original reports into a single document available to the Legislature and public. This is it."
