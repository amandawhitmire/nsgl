8,Abstract:,"The Marc Hershman Marine Policy Fellowship offers graduate students first-hand experience in crafting marine and natural resource policies. Beginning in October 2009, two qualified students per year will spend nine months working in Olympia with Washington State Ocean Caucus agencies.* Graduate students who attend Washington universities and are enrolled in a marine-related field, including policy, law, social sciences, oceanography and fishery sciences, are encouraged to apply. Fellows may be involved in working on marine policy questions from a variety of scientific, legal, social or economic perspectives. Among the issues identified for 2009 Fellow projects are climate change adaptation and preparation, Washington coastal hazards, renewable ocean energy, marine debris and harmful algal blooms."
