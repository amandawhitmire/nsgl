11,Abstract:,"Uses of natural resources often have public ramifications, even when the resource itself is privately owned; examples include smog, clear cuts, and pesticide-laden runoff. Controlling these uses, however, raises difficult questions in a nation strongly committed to individual freedom and private property rights. Partly for that reason, conflicts among contending interests can exceed the ability or political resources of government to manage. The emergence of environmental mediation, an informal approach to settling resource-â€‹related disputes, accordingly has been greeted as `an idea whose time has come.' Working at the front lines of conflict, yet unarmed with any of the coercive instruments of the state, mediators seek to hammer out agreements among parties that each will see as superior to continued struggle. This article examines a landmark accord in Washington State: the Timber, Fish, and Wildlife agreement mediated by the Northwest Renewable Resources Center. Analysis discusses events up until November 1989."
