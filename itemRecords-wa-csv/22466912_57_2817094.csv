10,Abstract:,"This winter, live, whole, Maine-grown scallops are being served in restaurants for the first time, thanks to many years of work by marine extension associate Dana Morse and fishermen Marsden and Robert Brewer of Stonington. They collaborated with Maine DMR and Bigelow Laboratory to analyze biotoxin data to ensure product safety. Preliminary market sales show great promise. Maine Sea Grant co-founded and coordinates the Alliance for Maine’s Marine Economy, securing more than $14 million in public and private funds for infrastructure investment and capital equipment grants. Industry partners to date include Cape Seafood, Maine Fair Trade Lobster, Cooke Aquaculture, Ready Seafood, Pemaquid Mussel Farm, Springtide Seaweed, Shucks Maine Lobster, Mook Sea Farm, Community Shellfish, and Blue Hill Bay Mussels. Marine extension associate Chris Bartlett coordinated efforts to improve fish passage and monitor river herring in the Pennamaquan River in Washington County. The alewife population rebounded from 70,000 in 2014 to 245,000 in 2016. As a result, the Department of Marine Resources reinstated recreational fishing and the community continues to work toward a commercial harvest. The stories, memories, and perspectives of local fishermen and their families, local marine businesses, and their neighbors are part of the multimedia Mapping Ocean Stories project. Marine extension associate Natalie Springuel worked with College of the Atlantic, the Island Institute, and Winter Harbor Historical Society to capture local knowledge of community connections to the sea. Maine Sea Grant created and coordinates the Southern Maine Volunteer Beach Profile Monitoring Program, in which hundreds of volunteers monitor beaches from York to Scarborough to measure seasonal and annual sand accretion and erosion. Data are used by municipalities and state and federal agencies, including the National Weather Service, to evaluate storm damage and inform decisions about development proposals and beach management. The program has been replicated in NH, MA, CA, and Mexico. Maine Sea Grant extension professor Esperanza Stancioff helps coordinate regional and statewide networks (Northeast Coastal Acidification Network and Maine Ocean and Coastal Acidification Partnership) to synthesize and share data and information on nearshore ocean chemistry. Partners are working toward goals established by a legislative committee to help the shellfish industry, farmed and wild, which is most vulnerable to ocean acidification. ​ Through fellowship and scholarship support, Maine Sea Grant supported 77 undergraduate and graduate students in 2016. In the last year, at least eight of these students are now employed in marine science-related positions at Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Bigelow Lab, Herring Gut Learning Center, Maine DMR, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, National Marine Fisheries Service, the Transportation Institute, and the U.S. Navy."
