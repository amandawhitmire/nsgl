13,Abstract:,"Understanding the dynamics of algal blooms requires knowledge of the life history of the causative organisms. Here biologists document the physiological cues that drive ""Heterosigma akashiwo"" to shift reversibly between the vegetative and resting cell phases of its life history. They also present information suggesting the ""Heterosigma"" isolates of different geographic origin may be genetically divergent."
