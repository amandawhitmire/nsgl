15,Abstract:,"The marine culture of salmon on the west coast of North America has utilized primarily Pacific salmon (""Oncorhynchus""â€‹) species, although Atlantic salmon (""Salmo salar"") have been reared in captivity in Puget Sound for over a decade. Recently, interest in the commercial culture of Atlantic salmon has been increasing due, in part, to the excellent performance of Atlantic salmon in culture, the increasing market demand for this species, and the influx of Norwegian-owned companies with extensive experience with Atlantic salmon. Increasing utilization of Atlantic salmon by salmon growers in the Puget Sound region has revealed extensive mortality of yearling fish during their first summer in seawater. The work reported here evaluates the effects of water temperature and feeding on smolting and seawater survival of yearling Atlantic salmon."
