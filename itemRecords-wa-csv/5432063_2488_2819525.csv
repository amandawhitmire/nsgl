9,Abstract:,"For a port to benefit fully from its accounting system, it is necessary to isolate specific data and use them, alone or in concert with other data, to provide input into the decision-making process. To analyze their operations in a meaningful way, ports need new or at least revised procedures. Washington Sea Grant, in cooperation with the American Association of Port Authorities and more than 70 public port authorities in the United States and Canada, has developed a simplified financial performance indicator system that can be used to measure, rapidly and accurately, how efficiently a port uses its resources, how carefully it controls its expenses, and how profitable it is. This system, presented here, is called the Port Management Control System."
