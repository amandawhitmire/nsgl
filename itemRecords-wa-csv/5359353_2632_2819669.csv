14,Abstract:,"A strategy for the commercializatiâ€‹on of chitin and chitosan is outlined which suggests that low-volume, high-value specialty applications precede the creation of high-volume, low-value commodity markets. As examples of the former, applications are described for wound- and burn-healing; treatment of dermatitis and fungal infection; contact lenses; and as a bacteriostat and fungistat."
