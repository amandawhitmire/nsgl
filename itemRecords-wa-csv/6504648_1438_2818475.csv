15,Abstract:,"Environments are complex socio-​ecological systems demanding interdisciplina​ry research and conservation. Despite significant progress in characterizing socio-​ecological complexity, cultural values and their importance to conservation remain poorly understood and inadequately accounted for in ecosystem-based management (EBM). In this review we synthesize existing social sciences to build an approach for better integrating cultural dimensions into coastal conservation. A focus on cultural dimensions helps identify important interactions between coastal resources and social groups, and improves socio-​ecological analyses and management. Using examples from coastal ecosystems in North America, our cultural dimensions of socio-​ecological systems model illustrates five key interrelated cultural aspects: meanings, values, and identities; knowledge and practice; governance and access; livelihoods; and cultural interactions with biophysical environments."
