11,Abstract:,"Once considered unlimited, resilient, and able to absorb anything we cared to dump into them, the oceans are really a fragile resource, requiring our careful stewardship. Much publicity is given to an oil spill when it occurs, but less well-known is the fact that 14 billion pounds of boat wastes, gear, and cargo are lost or deliberately dumped into the oceans every year, and these materials could have long-term effects as deleterious to the marine environment as an oil spill. This fact sheet focuses on the kind of damage that wastes in the marine environment can cause and how we, as responsible citizens, can help alleviate the problem."
