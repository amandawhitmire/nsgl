13,Abstract:,"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are one of the main tools for maintaining fish populations and conserving biodiversity. We know already that closing fisheries in specific areas may lead to more fish, larger fish and a more diverse community. There are also reports that such benefits 'spill over' to adjacent areas, mainly by emigration of adult fish, thus benefitting fisheries and biodiversity in general. What we absolutely don't know is the effect of MPAs on the production of new fish (called 'recruitment'), especially how far fish in a specific MPA would spread their offspring and if they have any chance to reach the next MPA. Most species of marine fish and invertebrates have a pelagic phase, when larvae float in the water column and are potentially carried away by ocean currents. These larvae are tiny, and so what we usually observe is that they hatch and, several weeks or months later, juveniles appear. Given the length of this pelagic phase, fairly strong ocean currents and the lack of any barriers that could stop the larvae, such 'dispersal' can be extensive. Nemo may go a far, far way! As there are no clownfish in Puget Sound, we are working on another species, brown rockfish (Sebastes auriculatus). Adult brown rockfish live in rocky reefs in Puget Sound and generally don't move much. In late summer, females give birth to tens of 1000s of live larvae which then drift around for about two months before they settle to the bottom as juveniles. We will use three techniques (oceanographic models, genetics, otolith microstructure to track larvae that are born on a reef at Point Heyer, Vason Island, Puget Sound."
