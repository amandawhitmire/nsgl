16,Abstract:,"Machine learning suggests suspended sediment drives macroalgal loss: Between 2011 and 2014, two large dams were removed in Washington’s Elwha River as part of an effort to open up waterways to historical fish passage. Such dam removals have become a popular and widespread effort nationwide, and their positive effects are well understood, yet little research has focused on the magnitude of coastal impacts caused by the removal process."
