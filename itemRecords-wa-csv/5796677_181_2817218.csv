15,Abstract:,"This report describes the results of monitoring and evaluation in 1992 of a recently created estuarine slough in the brackish reaches of a coastal estuary in Washington State. This was the second complete year of a functional assessment of this estuarine habitat, which was focused principally on the slough's function as fish and wildlife habitat. Results from the first full year (1991) of studies in both sloughs were reported in Simenstad et al. (1992)."
