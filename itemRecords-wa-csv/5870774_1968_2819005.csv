12,Abstract:,"Pea (""Pisum sativum"") endocarp tissue challenged with an incompatible fungal pathogen or fungal elicitors results in the induction of pathogenesis-â€‹related (PR) genes and the accumulation of pisatin, a phytoalexin. Essentially the same response occurs in pea tissue exposed to DNA-specific agents that crosslink or intercalate DNA. In this study, the effects of DNA-damaging agents were assessed relative to the inducible expression of several pea PR genes: phenylalanine ammonia lyase, chalcone synthase, and DRR206. Based on observations and previously published results, the authors propose that DNA damage or the associated alteration of chromatin can signal the transcriptional activation of plant defense genes."
