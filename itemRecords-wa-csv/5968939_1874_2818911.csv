10,Abstract:,"From earlier research, it was known that the valuable red seaweed ""Chondracanthus exasperatus"" exhibited dependable growth in tank culture and could be cloned and propagated perennially from vegetative fragments. Additional data were available about loading densities, seawater turnover, and mixing required for sustainable growth in intensive tank culture. This report includes both field and laboratory aspects of recent research which has progressed through three phases. The first phase investigated strategies for long-term maintenance of seaweed stocks and explored experimental and pilot scale tank designs for cultivation of ""C. exasperatus"". The second phase focused on increasing stock quantity and quality by selection and management of growth parameters and integrating water from fish (Pacific halibut) culture tanks. The third and most recent phase has emphasized reducing water use and pumping through recycling and spray culture."
