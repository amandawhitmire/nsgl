11,Abstract:,"The high mobility group (HMG) proteins are non-histone components of chromatin that regulate gene expression via interactions with chromatin and transactivating protein factors. Plants and animals possess a family of HMG proteins that are similar on the basis of a shared motif known as the AT-hook. The animal HMG proteins with AT- hooks, collectively known as the HMGA family, have been studied extensively. Based on such detailed studies of HMGA-mediated regulation of mammalian genes, analogous mechanisms of HMG-​I/Y-​mediated gene regulation in plants have been proposed. This review focuses primarily on the expression and proposed mechanisms of the AT-hook HMG proteins in plants and animals. An understanding of the variety of interactions of these proteins with chromatin in all eukaryotes is likely to provide insight into the regulatory properties of plant HMG-I/Y proteins."
