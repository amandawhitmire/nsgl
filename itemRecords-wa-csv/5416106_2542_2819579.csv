8,Abstract:,"Time series of total marine survival rate estimates for a number of North American salmonid stocks were reviewed; only species with extended fresh-water rearing phases were considered. Variability in marine survival is largely unexplainable from smolt data such as mean size, age composition, or abundance, and is generally poorly understood. The best correlation found so far between marine survival and marine environmental factor (stength of ocean-â€‹upwelling) is for coho salmon originating from the Oregon coast and Columbia River. However, the biological mechanism even for this case is not known."
