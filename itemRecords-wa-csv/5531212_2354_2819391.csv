12,Abstract:,"The induction potential of cell wall fractions of ""Pseudomonas syringae"" pv. ""pisi"" races 1, 2, and 3 were studied by using levels of pisatin and specific mRNA transcripts as a measure of host response. Neither the lipopolysacchar​ide, lipoprotein-​peptidoglycan preparations, nor the entire outer membrane preparation of any of the races induced pisatin accumulation. The complete bacterial envelope, however, induced moderate accumulations of pisatin and enhanced accumulation of disease resistance response RNAs nonspecifically in almost all combinations of bacterial envelopes and plant cultivars."
