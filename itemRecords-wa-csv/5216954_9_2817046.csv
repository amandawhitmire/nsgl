11,Abstract:,"The following evaluation study of Washington Sea Grant activities responds to a general expression of public concern: the demand for accountability in publicly funded programs. Competition among and within the many federal agencies for appropriations from a finite federal budget clearly places upon each entity the responsibility of reviewing past performance, scrutinizing current projects, and assessing probable consequences. The following study will examine the mechanisms by which Sea Grant identifies awareness of regional needs in marine resource areas, coordinates the development of educational objectives, selects courses and programs which satisfy them and, finally, commits funds for their operation. The report will similarly examine the mechanisms used to, first, identify existing research activities relevant to regional marine resource needs; second, to define new research programs in hitherto neglected, but important aeas; and finally, to integrate often fragmented research efforts into need-oriented, cohesive programs. The role of advisory services throughout theses processes will be described and documented. While Sea Grant's activities might be characterized by their diversity, one issue is pervasive: Sea Grant's primary role of promoting and maintaining relationships among all the participants in the use and management of marine resources. Four broad categories of participation can be defined: 1. Institutions of higher education. 2. Regional marine resource-â€‹oriented industries. 3. Public agencies. 4. The Interested public."
