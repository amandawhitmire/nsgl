11,Abstract:,"Blooms of harmful phytoplankton in Puget Sound, Washington, have proven to be a major impediment to marine salmon culture and may cause mortality of wild salmon. The effects of the marine diatom ""Chaetoceros concavicornis"" on seawater-â€‹acclimated, subadult Atlantic salmon were studied during short-term bioassays. Blood- oxygen partial pressure of fish exposed to environmentally common and greater concentrations of the diatom was significantly less than control fish. Conversely, carbon dioxide partial pressure of affected fish was significantly greater than that of control fish in all but the lowest diatom concentration (10-4 cells L-1). Changes in blood-gas partial pressure were correlated with histopathology showing profuse mucus production from gill tissue, despite no signs of penetration by the sharp spines of the diatom."
