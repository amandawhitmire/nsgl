15,Abstract:,"A series of acoustic surveys conducted in 1994 and 1995 near the Pribilof Islands (Alaska) allow for the examination of the spatial proximity of juvenile walleye pollock (""Theragra chalcogramma"") and their prey (primarily copepods and euphausiids). The authors of this paper address four questions: How do the spatial distributions of pollock and zooplankton change from year-to-year, transect to transect and day to night? How does the spatial distribution of age-0 pollock related to that of their zooplankton prey? Are there consistent differences in predator-prey proximity and biomass between the transects that hold over years, and, if so, are these differences related to differences in frontal structure and current patterns around the Pribilof Islands?; Are differences in the proximity between pollock and their prey related to differences in their relative abundance?"
