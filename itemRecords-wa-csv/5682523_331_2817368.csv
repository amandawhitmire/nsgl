10,Abstract:,"This video documents the experience of a group of citizens in one of the small coastal communities mentioned in the report above. Raymond, Washington, a small coastal community. They were appointed by the mayor to design a plan for redeveloping the community's downtown waterfront. Based on a planning model outlined in the book ""Waterfront Revitalization for Small Cities"", the approach followed in Raymond produced a waterfront plan that was supported by the community, and by the local port district and state and federal agencies with a stake in the plan's success."
