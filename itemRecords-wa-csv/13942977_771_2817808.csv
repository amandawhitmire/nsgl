13,Abstract:,"The purpose of the Eelgrass-​Sulfide workshop was to develop a deeper understanding of seagrass-​sulfide interactions in Puget Sound and worldwide. To accomplish this we: 1. Synthesized the current state of research through discussions and presentations; 2. Developed new seagrass-​sulfide research ideas through collaboration; 3. Determined the implications and applications of sulfide research for seagrass restoration. Throughout the workshop we considered the interaction of seagrass and sulfide worldwide and how this applies to the range of sulfide conditions throughout Puget Sound. The workshop participants reviewed seagrass-​sulfide interactions, discussed new research ideas and management implications and initiated the creation of a database of sulfide ranges in Puget Sound and around the globe."
