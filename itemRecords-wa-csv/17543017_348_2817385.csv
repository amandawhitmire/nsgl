11,Abstract:,"Global climate change by way of warming ocean temperatures and ocean acidificationth​reatens the survival of marine organisms. For mussels, survival is tightly tied to byssal threadsthey form that anchor them to substrates, from the rocky intertidal to mussel aquaculture lines.Weakened byssal threads increase the likelihood of “fall-off” or “sloughing” from rocks andaquaculture lines, disturbing intertidal communities and reducing aquaculture yields. Seasonalvariati​on in mussel attachment strength suggests environmental conditions may alter byssalthread strength and production. In this dissertation, I explore the role of rising temperature andocean acidification on the mechanical performance of mussel byssal threads to improvepredicti​ons of what environmental conditions may precede fall-off events. In Chapter 1, I exposemussels (Mytilus trossulus) to a range of pH (7.3 – 8.2, total scale) and temperature conditions (10 – 25°C) in a full factorial cross. Elevated temperature dramatically weakens musselattachmen​t: mussels produce 60% weaker and 65% fewer threads at 25°C in comparison to 10°C.The effects of temperature are strongest in the proximal region of the threads. Low pH (7.3)strengthen​s the plaque region of the thread by 20%, but has no effect on overall byssal threadstrength. Since a thread is only as strong as its weakest region, these stressors do not actsynergistica​lly with each other; the strongest negative effect dominates, in this case temperature.Cha​pter 2 expands on the impacts of temperature on attachment strength, finding species-​specifictempera​ture effects. In the northeast Pacific, the warm-adapted mussel M. galloprovincial​is andcold-adapted mussel M. trossulus compete for space on shore. While the attachment strength ofthese two closely related species does not differ from 11 - 18°C, at temperatures from 18 -24.5°C, M. trossulus attachment strength decreases while M. galloprovincial​is attachmentstren​gth increases. At temperatures greater than 18°C M. trossulus produces fewer and weakerbyssal threads with attachments that were up to 93% weaker than M. galloprovincial​is. Chapter3 follows up these laboratory studies using the field setting of a mussel farm to examinecorrelat​ions between ocean conditions and attachment strength in M. trossulus. In the field, weakattachment strength in M. trossulus is best predicted by high temperature >14°C and low pH,<7.5. Similar to the lab study, the effects of these two stressors are independent of each other.Altogethe​r, these results find mussels and the communities they support are vulnerable tomultiple aspects of future ocean conditions. Warming oceans may increase the competitiveadva​ntage of M. galloprovincial​is in more northern latitudes at the expense of native M.trossulus populations. Monitoring these conditions near farms can signal periods whereattachment is expected to be weak in order to best adapt farming practices."
