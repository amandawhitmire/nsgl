11,Abstract:,"To better interpret the evolution and behavior of beaches and coastlines, geomorphologistâ€‹s developed the concept of a littoral cell. Just as watersheds delineate the boundary of a river system, littoral cells are landscape-scale units that delineate the boundary of a beach-sediment system. Waves supply energy to the cell, and the dissipation of wave energy drives the erosion and transport of beach material along the shoreline. When wave energy is insufficient to mobilize sediment further, deposition and accumulation occur. Understanding how waves interact with sediment and, in particular, their influence on the long- term redistribution of sediment along the shoreline, is central to evaluating the operation of littoral cells. This brief article applies the concept of littoral drift cells to Puget Sound."
