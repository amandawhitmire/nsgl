9,Abstract:,"New marine technology has frequently been evaluated on the basis of the contributions it can make to efficiency and balance of payments, and for its biological and environmental impact. In contrast, the social dimensions in employment, the stability of communities, population redistribution, retraining and other human resource requirements have not always been featured clearly or soon enough. In this booklet, the author concentrates primarily on the social impact of current and future technological changes in ports and shipping, but he also touches on changes affecting commercial fishing."
