10,Abstract:,"One area of the Northwest that is experiencing considerable growth in tourism is the Columbia River Gorge--a spectacular 85-mile canyon where the Columbia River carved out the only sea-level break through the Cascade Mountains. As the number of visitors to the Gorge continues to increase, additional public facilities and business services will be needed to accommodate this growth. To guide the planning and investment for these developments, information is needed on the number of visitors, their recreational patterns and expenditures, their preferences for additional facilities, and the economic impact of their activities. This report highlights the results of a Columbia River Gorge tourism study conducted during the summer of 1987. The overall objective of this study was to provide baseline information on various aspects of Gorge tourism."
