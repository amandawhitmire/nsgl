11,Abstract:,"Persistent problems in salmon aquaculture include the mortality of pen-cultured fish due to early maturation of males, the added expense of rearing juveniles of some species in freshwater, and the stress and mortality which can be associated with transferring those same species to seawater. Hybridizations may ameliorate some of these problems, and triploid hybrids frequently survive and grow much better than corresponding diploids. The viabilities and allozyme phenotypes of progeny from diploid and triploid interspecific matings between coho (""Oncorhynchus kisutch""), chum (""O. keta""), and chinook (""O. tshawytscha"") salmon were determined in this study. Several hybrids showing promise for aquaculture were identified."
