12,Abstract:,"For some years the concept of maximum sustained yield (MSY) guided efforts at fisheries management. There is now wide-spread agreement that this concept was unfortunate. Scientific certainty and consensus in itself would not prevent overexploitatioâ€‹n and destruction of resources. Many practices continue even in cases where there is abundant scientific evidence that they are ultimately destructive. Once we free ourselves from the illusion that science or technology (if lavishly funded) can provide a solution to resource or conservation problems, appropriate action becomes possible. Effective policies are possible under conditions of uncertainty, but they must take uncertainty into account. Most principles of decision-making under uncertainty are simply common sense. We must consider a variety of plausible hypotheses about the world; consider a variety of possible strategies; favor actions that are robust to uncertainties; hedge; favor actions that are informative; probe and experiment; monitor results; update assessments and modify policy accordingly; and favor actions that are reversible."
