12,Abstract:,"Here engineers describe a real-time implementation of feature-based concurrent mapping and localization running on a mobile robot in a dynamic indoor environment. Several innovations are combined to demonstrate the ability for a mobile robot to autonomously return back to its starting position within a few centimeters of precision, despite the presence of numerous people walking through the environment."
