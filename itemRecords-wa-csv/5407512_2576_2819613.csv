7,Abstract:,"A uniform process of technical information assembly and application has been conducted for six major estuarine systems in Florida. Since 1976, local and regional coastal resource decisions affecting over 50% of the state's population have been assisted by various scientific and policy-oriented conferences, publications, and resultant actions focused on just these areas. Consolidation and interpretation of scientific data and transfer of information have fostered cooperative actions among public and private interests for Apalachicola, Biscayne, Choctawhatchee, and Tampa bays, the St. Johns River and vicinity, and Indian River Lagoon. Habitat restoration, revised management, increased public awareness and research have resulted from legistative and civic initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to describe this information transfer effort according to techniques common to all the Florida estuarine systems so far addressed."
