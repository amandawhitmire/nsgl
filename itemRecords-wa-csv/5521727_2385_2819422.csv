10,Abstract:,"Disease takes a heavy toll on shellfish around the world. Parasites, for example, have destroyed oyster beds in France and in the Delaware and Chesapeake embayments, and have now appeared in oysters on the Washington coast. Diseases such as nocardiosis and hemic neoplasia cost oyster and mussel growers millions of dollars every year. By learning about the diseases and the aquaculture practices that encourage or inhibit them, shellfish farmers and hatchery managers can enhance productivity and profit. This illustrated guide to specific mollusc diseases is written with the shellfish farmer in mind. It is organized by species and by major diseases of that species, with an emphasis on the major cultivated bivalves. Each disease is described in its historical and geographical context, with details on mortality rates, environmental factors, seasonality, diagnosis, and preventive measures. Pathologists in the U.S., Canada, and Australia who can diagnose diseases are listed; how to collect, preserve, and deliver tissue samples for diagnosis is described."
