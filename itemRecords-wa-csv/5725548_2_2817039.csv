14,Abstract:,"The Sea Grant Strategic Plan Implementation Committee assembled and reviewed all of the reports resulting from the Sea Grant Week '95 planning meeting in Puerto Rico and met in December 1995 in Washington, D.C., to craft an implementation plan that it hoped would be of use to everyone in the Sea Grant Network --individual Sea Grant programs, the National Sea Grant Office NSGO! and the National Review Panel. The committee felt strongly that it would be desirable for every program to develop an implementation plan. We also felt that a reasonably uniform approach by all programs, as well as for the NSGO, would be desirable. These implementation plans are meant to serve as a management tool for each program, as a means of planning cooperative ventures among pro grams and as a framework fort he NSGO to assist in the coordination of activities among the national programs. Furthermore, the NSGO could then use these plans, together with the research subcommittee in the new Sea Grant Association structure, to develop new initiatives. With these caveats in mind, the committee developed a set of guiding principles and an implementation plan outline that provides a framework for each program to use in its planning activities. The intended audiences include. (1) individua} Sea Grant programs; (2) the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), specifically the NSGO and NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research; (3) the Sea Grant network and other Sea Grant partners; (4) other science agencies; and (5) Sea Grant constituency groups."
