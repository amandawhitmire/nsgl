11,Abstract:,"Disease resistance response genes (DRRG) of peas are expressed as the tissue is expressing race-specific or nonhost resistance. The accumulation of DRRG mRNA in pea endocarp tissue occurs 2-4 hr after treatment with chitosan or inoculation with the incompatible pathogen ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli""; at this time, cytologically observed resistance is occurring. Conversely, there is a sharp reduction in DRRG mRNA accumulation at 20-24 hr when cytologically observed susceptibility occurs in the compatible reaction with ""Fusarium s."" f. sp. ""pisi"". To understand the molecular mechanism of induction and host- regulated responses, pea genomic clones of DRRG49-c were obtained; a transient expression system was used to test the functionality of the DRRG49-c promoter."
