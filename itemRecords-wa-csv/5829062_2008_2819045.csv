12,Abstract:,"Regulation of gene expression in plastids may involve molecular components conserved from cyanobacteria-​like ancestors. Among prokaryotes, genes are commonly regulated at the transciptional level by ""two compartment,"" or ""His-Asp,"" signal transducers, consisting of a ""sensor kinase,"" which autophosphoryla​tes at a conserved histidine residue, and a cognate response regulator, which is phosphorylated by the sensor kinase at the conserved aspartate residue. A putative His-Asp response regulator gene, ""trg1"" (transcriptiona​l regulatory gene 1), has been identified in the estuarine raphidophytic alga ""Heterosigma akashiwo."" Homology searches suggest that ""Heterosigma trg1"" has an ""ompR""-like identity within the DNA-binding His-Asp family of response regulators. ""Trg1"" contains both the phosphorylation and DNA binding domains which are present in prokaryote response regulators. Quantitative competitive RT-PCR showed that ""Heterosigma trg1"" is expressed at low levels. In contrast, ""psbA"" (a photosystem II component) transcript is abundant. Cell cycle analysis showed that ""psbA"" abundance oscillates in response to light but ""trg1"" mRNA levels are invariant. The authors hypothesize that His-Asp phosphorelay mechanism may affect chloroplast genome transcription in a manner similar to bacterial signal transduction pathways in which ""sensor kinase"" and cognate ""response regulator"" proteins interact."
