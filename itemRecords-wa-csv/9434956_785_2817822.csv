13,Abstract:,"InÂ the Pacific Northwest there are several genera of algae that can cause harm when populations reach high enough numbers. During harmful algal blooms (HABs), the algal species and their toxins can accumulate in shellfish and can also be transferred up the food chain to humans. In addition, high concentrations of some algal species can cause fish mortalities. Due to the apparent increase in these HAB occurrences during the last decade, the partnership, SoundToxins was formed."
