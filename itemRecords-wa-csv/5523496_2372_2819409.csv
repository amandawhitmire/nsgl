13,Abstract:,"Androgenesis is a technique which involves the production of individuals with all their chromosomes from the male parent. It can be useful in generating homozygous lines of fish and in the recovery of genotypes from cryopreserved sperm. However, the survival of androgenetic diploid fish is typically very low. To address the importance of various factors in the viability of androgenetic fish, researchers generated androgenetic diploid rainbow trout both by the conventional procedure of fertilizing irradiated eggs with haploid sperm and suppressing first cleavage and by using sperm from tetraploid males. Androgenetic diploids produced with sperm from tetraploid males showed much better viability than androgenetic diploids produced from haploid sperm. The implications of these results for androgenesis and gene banking are discussed."
