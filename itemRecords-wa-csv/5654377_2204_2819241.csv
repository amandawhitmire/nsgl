11,Abstract:,This paper seeks to determine the sociocultural correlates of differences in evaluation of factors associated with the danger of commercial fishing accidents in southern New England. It is anticipated that fishermen's evaluations of the relative importance of different causal factors will be useful to personnel interested in promoting fishing vessel safety. This information should facilitate the development of culturally appropriate training and enforcement programs.
