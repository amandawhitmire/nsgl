14,Abstract:,"During the 1992-94 biennium two teams of university Sea Grant and extension personnel and their supporting graduate students helped two small coastal cities in the Pacific Northwest develop and begin to implement waterfront revitalization plans. Community planning reams in Raymond, Wash., and Warrenton, Ore., appointed jointly by their respective municipal and local port district officials, made the commitment to test the proposition that small communities can, with very limited technical assistance, develop and begin co implement well thought-out, community-based plans that expand local economies and improve quality of life. The planning process they followed is described in Waterfront Revitalization for Small Cities, a planning guide written in 1990 by the two principal investigators."
