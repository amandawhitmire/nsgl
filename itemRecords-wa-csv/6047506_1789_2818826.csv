9,Abstract:,"Non-indigenous aquatic species are a threat to marine resources around the world, with new introductions occurring on every coast. The introduction of NIS into coastal marine and estuarine waters comes from a variety of sources. Due to the large volumes and frequency of possible inoculations, ballast water is currently the most frequently cited method for the worldwide transference of NIS. Ballast water treatment by ozonation is one of the many treatment technologies being studied for implementation on board commercial vessels. Prior to any treatment system's application on board commercial vessels, all effects of a treatment must be defined. The objectives of the research were: (1) To better understand ozone and its residual products in seawater by performing bench-scale experiments to determine total residual oxidant (TRO) reductions over time. (2) Conduct ozone treatment experiments at the mesocosm level at the Marrowstone USGS Marine Field Station to determine a minimal TRO concentration for the removal of organisms at multiple trophic levels. (3) Using flow cytometry to develop a rapid biological analysis of ballast water that could be used for regulatory monitoring of the microbial population. Statistical comparison of the ozone dissolution rates, as measured by the increasing TRO over the ozonation period, is dependent on the source water. There was significant difference in the rate of TRO decay dependent on the salinity, when synthetic seawater was compared between two salinities, 15 and 30 PSU. The significant difference in the rate of TRO decay may not be due to the difference in salinity and/or the difference in TOC between the two salinity preparations. Analysis of synthetic seawater and Puget Sound seawater indicated that there was no significant difference between the initial TRO concentrations of 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mg/L Br2 and the rate of TRO decay over time. Each independent source water showed significant differences in the rate of TRO decay, indicating that with increasing TOC, there was an increase in the rate of TRO decay. Biological effects of ozone treatment in seawater were studied at the USGS Marrowstone Marine Station to observe the TRO concentrations necessary for the removal/reducti​on of bacteria, phytoplankton, and mesozooplankton to meet ballast treatment standards proposed by the State of Washington and the International Maritime Organization. A 4-log heterotrophic bacterial reduction was seen for initial TRO concentrations greater than 1.5 mg/L Br2. However, the bacterial abundances returned to control concentrations with time, dependent on the initial TRO level. Initial chlorophyll a abundance ranged from 22.0-0.37 ug/L and was reduced to an average of 0.05 ug/L, for initial TRO concentrations greater than 1.5 mg/L Br2. Analysis showed that there was a significant difference in live mesozooplankton abundance at 168 h between mesocosms having an initial TRO of 1.85 mg/L Br2 and those greater than 2 mg/L Br2, suggesting a larger abundance of live zooplankton with the initial TRO of 1.85 mg/L Br2. This experiment indicated that a mean initial TRO of 1.85 mg/L Br2 may be an insufficient oxidant concentration. The same analysis was also performed for the mesozooplankton Cirripedia nauplii, and similar results were found. Cirripedia nauplii were found to be one of the more abundant and hardiest mesozooplankton and these could be considered an indicator organism for future ballast water toxicity assays when examining the mesozooplankton trophic level within Puget Sound. Any ballast water treatment technology that is applied will require verification that the treatment was performed and the standards have been met. A rapid analysis of microbial levels and viability could be of great importance in the verification process. Plate counts of aquatic ecosystems have sometimes represented only 10% of the total microscopic counts. The use of flow cytometry for bacterial assessment of ballast water treatment is comparable to epifluorescent microscopy and has the additional benefits of faster analysis time, lack of human count bias, and the ability to discern fluorescent intensities. The results of this study indicated that both the high DNA (HDNA) and low DNA (LDNA) bacterial populations were significantly reduced when subjected to a TRO level of 1.6-1.9 mg/L Br2 (greater than 99% HDNA and 97% total bacterial removal). The reduced reduction in the LDNA population, compared to HDNA, suggested a slight difference in bacterial response to oxidation. This may be due to those cells being previously dead and unable to react to the oxidant or those cells being inactive spores which may also be more resistant to treatment."
