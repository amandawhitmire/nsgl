12,Abstract:,"Structures for deploying aids to navigation (ATONs) are being developed to resist collisions with marine traffic. These compliant pile systems are intended to hold ATONs at fixed points during normal operating conditions yet flex away from a colliding vessel. The purpose of this study was to mathematically model the impact process to predict the time response of the vessel/pile contact force and the forces which must be sustained by the system's foundation. Several mathematical models were developed covering the various physical mechanisms involved and using different solution methods. Models were compared with data from previous experiments and were applied to a full scale prototype design. Predictions were consistent with the physical model data, and comparisons verified computational techniques."
