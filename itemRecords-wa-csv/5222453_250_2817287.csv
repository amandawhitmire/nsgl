10,Abstract:,"This paper is an attempt to describe alternative means by which the uses of water and the adjacent land of the Puget Sound region can be organized and managed. In the process, attention will be given both to relevant literature concerning environmental policy and management and to structural arrangements as they either have been proposed or currently exist in managing water resources. However, some unique aspects of the Puget Sound situation may limit the application of standards, forms, and practices developed elsewhere."
