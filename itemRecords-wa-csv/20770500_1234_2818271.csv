12,Abstract:,"Puget Sound is one of the most naturally beautiful and ecologically diverse locations in the Pacific Northwest. However, these waters are home to several species of algae that can produce deadly toxins when water conditions encourage their populations to explode. During these harmful algal blooms (HABs), the algae and their toxins accumulate in shellfish and are also transferred up the food chain to marine and terrestrial animals. High concentrations of some algal species can sicken or kill marine birds, mammals, or humans and can cause fish to die in large numbers. We formed SoundToxins—the Partnership for Enhanced Monitoring and Emergency Response to HABs in Puget Sound—to combat the apparent increase in these HAB occurrences over the past decade. SoundToxins is a diverse partnership of shellfish farmers, fish farmers, environmental learning centers, volunteers, local health jurisdictions, colleges, and Native American tribes that was conceived and initiated by the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), and is now co-directed by Washington Sea Grant (WSG). SoundToxins has grown from four partners in 2006 to 28 partners in 2017, some of whom monitor multiple sites in Puget Sound. SoundToxins has three main objectives: To document unusual bloom events and new species entering Puget Sound. To determine the environmental conditions that promote the onset and flourishing of HABs. To determine the combination of monitoring parameters that provide the earliest warnings of these events."
