11,Abstract:,"The authors present an overview of themes addressed at the North Pacific Symposium on Stock Assessment and Management of Invertebrates (March 1995) and compare them to those from an essentially analogous event held 11 years earlier. The diversity of resources, scales, dynamics, and harvest styles involved in the assessment and management of invertebrate resources are highlighted and categorized, with emphasis on specific problems presented by stocks of benthic organisms with meroplanktonic larvae. The review is focused around two main themes: the development of spatially explicit approaches to assessment and management and the participation of fishers and other stakeholders in the management process."
