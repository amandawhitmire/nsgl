12,Abstract:,"Researchers used field studies and laboratory experiments to investigate competitive dynamics among intertidal crabs in North America. Competition for shelter and food were observed in two relationships: on the east coast where European green crab ""Carcinus maenas"" is the resident species and the recent invader is the Asian shore crab ""Hemigraspus sanguineus""; and on the west coast where green crab is the recent invader and the resident species is ""H. oregonensis""."
