11,Abstract:,"The Dean John A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship provides eligible graduate students a one-year opportunity to work in Washingon D.C., on a congressional staff or with an executive agency dealing with marine issues. The fellowships are federally funded and administered through the National Sea Grant College Program. During the past 18 years, 34 University of Washington Knauss fellows look back at their experience and consider the ways they were able to contribute to national marine policy decision-â€‹making, and how the fellowship changed their lives."
