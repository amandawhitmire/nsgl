8,Abstract:,"The report compares the five New England states to selected case studies, identifying transferability of similar programs to each state. The report notes any gaps and identifies actions needed to implement similar programs. In 2015, the National Sea Grant Law Center (NSGLC) at the University of Mississippi School of Law received a grant award from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s (NFWF) Fishing for Energy Partnership to help New England managers assess the feasibility of implementing innovative derelict fishing gear removal strategies in their states. Lost nets and other heavy fishing equipment can damage ecosystems as they are moved by tides and waves along the sea floor. Derelict fishing gear also impacts navigational safety, damages active fishing equipment and boats, and causes economic repercussions for coastal industries and communities across the country. The laws and regulations governing the removal of derelict fishing gear vary by fishery and state. To assess the feasibility of implementing innovative removal strategies in their states, New England managers need a better understanding of the current legal framework governing derelict fishing gear removal and how existing state marine debris programs are authorized. The six case studies documented in this report highlight successful strategies for marine debris removal. In Florida, the Spiny Lobster, Stone Crab and Blue Crab Trap Retrieval Program authorizes commercial fishermen, who know the local area and own trap-pulling vessels, to remove traps from state waters during closed seasons. Louisiana has a similar removal program, which authorizes agencies, individual volunteers, and organizations to remove any abandoned pots and deposit them at designated disposal sites. In New Hampshire, where the majority of the coastline is state-​owned, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department (NHFGD) has expanded the authority to remove derelict fishing gear beyond NHFGD conservation officers and gear owners by signing a Memorandum of Agreement with another agency to allow those employees to act as agents of the NHFGD and remove derelict fishing gear. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and other federal and state agencies have drafted removal guidelines for implementation of a derelict fishing gear (DFG) removal program in the Puget Sound. The report also highlights two programs outside of the typical derelict fishing gear removal programs: Maine’s abandoned aq These case studies are intended to illustrate how states have adjusted existing state law to target a particular issue. Among the integral strategies of the selected case studies are: 1) clear definitions of derelict, abandoned, or intact gear; 2) authorization for commercial fishermen, agency personnel, and volunteers to remove gear; 3) a closed season to facilitate gear removal; 4) clear guidelines for gear removal, including streamlined notification and disposal requirements; and 5) innovative funding mechanisms. The case studies are not intended to provide exhaustive descriptions of each state’s derelict fishing gear program. Rather, these case studies are designed to highlight key components of marine debris removal programs that could serve as models for transfer into New England states. In comparing each case study to the five New England states, this report notes similarities of the programs to each state, as well as any gaps and actions needed to implement similar programs. New England states may use this report to evaluate whether their particular states could transfer some of the ideas and components from the case studies to increase the effectiveness of their derelict fishing gear programs. uaculture gear removal program and Maryland’s abandoned vessel removal program."
