13,Abstract:,"disease resistance, fungicide sticker, defense genes, antifungal, gene transcription, chitosan"
14,,"The polycationic chitosan has been shown to be antimicrobial (antifungal), 2) capable of inducing total immunity to plant pathogens and 3) an effective activator of plant defense genes called pathogenesis- related or PR genes. Chitosan is a natural component of some fungi and is released in the interaction between the root rotting fungus, ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli"" and pea. Documentation of the role of chitosan as a natural elicitor of the plant's disease resistance response and the suspected DNA reception of this elicitation are summarized. Following entrance into the plant cell, the potential of chitosan may be realized by suppressing the function of a high mobility group (HMG) gene, called HMG-I/Y. A model for explaining the effect of the chitosan-â€‹mediated depletion of HMG-I/Y and the effect of other DNA-specific agents on the DNA within the promoter of defense genes will be discussed. In addition to inducing defense genes, chitosan can also be used as a ""sticker"" in cooperation with antimicrobial copper compounds to control the late blight disease of potato."
