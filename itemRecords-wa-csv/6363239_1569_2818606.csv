13,Abstract:,"Many harmful algal blooming (HAB) species transition between a vegetative, motile phase in the water column and a dormant, non-motile resting phase in the sediments. These life history transitions potentially regulate the timing, location and persistence of bloom events. Motility promotes aggregation and influences vertical distributions in the water column. However, the contribution of this behavior to benthic distributions of resting cells is currently unknown. We used video-tracking techniques to test the hypothesis that algal cells use active down-swimming during pelagic-benthic transition to favorably influence benthic distributions. In an experimental water column, we monitored cell swimming trajectories of Heterosigma akashiwo for 14 days after cells were signaled to enter the benthic resting stage. Using the statistical characteristics of individual cell trajectories, we developed a video-based motion assay to assign each tracked Heterosigma cell to one of three cell states known to occur during pelagic-benthic transition: induced motile, transitional and resting. The primary swimming characteristic influencing benthic distribution, net vertical velocity, was essentially the same for all three cell states. Hence, we found no evidence that active down-swimming influences benthic distributions. Our data suggest that benthic distributions of Heterosigma resting cells are similar to distributions of slowly sedimenting passive particles. These observations suggest that Heterosigma benthic resting cell distributions can be predicted by modeling the effects of cell sedimentation rates combined with geophysical flow patterns."
