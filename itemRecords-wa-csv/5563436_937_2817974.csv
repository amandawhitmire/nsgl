12,Abstract:,"A cornerstone of water quality management is the ability to generate reliable scientific and technical information which illuminates the nature of water quality problems and their probable causes, and points the way toward techniques and approaches for their resolution. But water quality management takes place in a political and institutional context which also provides a framework in which the differing objectives of members of society are reconciled, and policies which reflect the dominant values are developed and implemented. The success of this institutional framework management may well be related to its ability to assure that appropriate information is utilized and that important scientific uncertainties are addressed. But success may also be related to the approach these institutions take to the twin tasks of balancing competing objectives and addressing the sometimes conflicting claims of interest groups. To assess how governance arrangements have developed and evolved, this study examined three important problem areas. These are: the problems of nonpoint pollution found to exist throughout rural areas in the Puget Sound region; the program to develop, under PSDDA, a system of dumpsites within Puget Sound to receive dredge spoils; and the development of standards to guide decisions on contaminated sediment remediation."
