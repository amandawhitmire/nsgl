9,Abstract:,"The geoduck (Panopea generosa) is North America's largest burrowing clam. It is found in soft intertidal and subtidal marine habitats in the northeast Pacific Ocean to depths of more than 200 feet. In Washington state, this large clam has been cultured for enhancement of wild stocks since 1991 and on a commercial scale since 1996. However, there was little scientific information available on the ecological impacts of applicable culture practices. In 2007, at the direction of the State Legislature, Washington Sea Grant, based at the University of Washington, established a six-year geoduck aquaculture research program to assess possible effects of geoduck aquaculture on the Puget Sound and Strait of Juan de Fuca environments. This interim report summarizes the progress of the program to date and provides detailed reports on studies conducted between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2010."
