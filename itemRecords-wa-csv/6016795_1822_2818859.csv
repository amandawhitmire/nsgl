11,Abstract:,"Puget Sound is known for its highly variable weather and ocean currents. Trip planning for this challenging environment is critical for boating safety. The authors conducted a survey of the Puget Sound boating community to determine their information needs. They used a web-based questionnaire supplemented with face-to-face surveys. They received 610 responses. The respondents represented a wide range of the boating community. The boaters' most important environmental need was for daily weather forecasts and their most desired forecast parameters were wind speed, currents, and wave height. Respondents also commented on their frustration with accessing the needed information. Analysis of this survey and guidance from an advisory panel are being used to develop a user centered designed (UCD) web portal, the Boater Information System (BIS) that will attempt to improve the situation awareness (SA) for a diverse user group."
