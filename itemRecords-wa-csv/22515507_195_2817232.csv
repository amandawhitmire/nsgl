9,Abstract:,"Thank you for your work to help protect Washington’s shorelines! As a volunteer monitor, you will conduct two types of survey to monitor pocket estuaries in Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the San Juan Islands for invasion by European green crab (Carcinus maenas): trapping and shoreline surveys. The Crab Team staff at Washington Sea Grant (WSG) has identified sites that are thought to be at highest risk of invasion based on habitat suitability. To increase the chances that we will detect green crab at the earliest possible stages of invasion into inland Washington waters, monitors will: ● work with a team of 3-5 monitors at an assigned site, ● conduct monthly surveys from April through September of each year, ● submit data to Crab Team within a week of completing surveys, and ● notify Crab Team immediately upon finding evidence of green crab presence. We will increase monitoring at sites where green crab have been positively identified to determine whether crabs are successfully establishing at that site, and how they are affecting other organisms in the community."
