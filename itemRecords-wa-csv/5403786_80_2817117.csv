8,Abstract:,"This paper is the third annual analysis of the NOAA budget prepared by the Sea Grant Association and the Marine Division of the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges. This analysis of NOAA's FY 1988 budget request examines the budgetary and policy implications of this request and recommends some responses to the issues raised. The analysis concentrates on the operations, research and facilities (ORF) account in the budget. Some attention is necessarily given to financing aspects. Within the ORF account, this paper is focused primarily on the Ocean and Research sections, with a lesser degree of attention devoted to other aspects."
