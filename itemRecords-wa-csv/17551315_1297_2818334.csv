23,Abstract:,"Data from 4,713 fisheries worldwide, representing 78% of globalreported fish catch, are analyzed to estimate the status, trends,and benefits of alternative approaches to recovering depletedfisheri​es. For each fishery, we estimate current biological statusand forecast the impacts of contrasting management regimes oncatch, profit, and biomass of fish in the sea. We estimate uniquerecovery targets and trajectories for each fishery, calculate the yearby-year effects of alternative recovery approaches, and model howalternative institutional reforms affect recovery outcomes. Currentstatus is highly heterogeneous—t​he median fishery is in poor health(overfish​ed,with further overfishing occurring), although 32% of fisheriesare in good biological, although not necessarily economic, condition.Our business-​as-​usual scenario projects further divergence andcontinued collapse for many of the world’s fisheries. Applying soundmanagement reforms to global fisheries in our dataset could generateannual increases exceeding 16 million metric tons (MMT) in catch,$53 billion in profit, and 619 MMT in biomass relative to business asusual. We also find that, with appropriate reforms, recovery can happenquickly, with the median fishery taking under 10 y to reach recoverytargets​. Our results show that commonsense reforms tofishery management would dramatically improve overall fish abundancewhile increasing food security and profits."
