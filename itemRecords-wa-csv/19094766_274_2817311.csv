9,Abstract:,"The purpose of this guide is to help slow or stop the spread of invasive species in the Mid-Atlantic region. Therefore, in addition to identification, it includes sections on prevention, reporting, and collecting specimens. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) pose a significant environmental and economic threat to the ecosystems and communities of the Mid-Atlantic region and beyond. The Mid-Atlantic region encompasses eight states, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina, as well as Washington D.C. The region is home to the Chesapeake Bay; the largest estuary in the United States, with more than 150 major rivers and streams flowing into its 64,299-​square-​mile basin. In the Chesapeake Bay watershed alone, nearly 200 known or possible invasive species have been recorded. Global trade, human activities, recreation, and climate change are helping invasive species spread at accelerated rates. Once established, controlling their spread is both technically difficult and expensive, making eradication nearly impossible. Therefore, identifying and preventing the introduction of these species is the key to averting long-term ecosystem damage, and to ensuring the highest probability of effective control. This field guide is designed to aid science professionals and other interested individuals in AIS early detection and reporting. This reference can help water conservation officers, regional biologists, volunteer monitors, resource managers, educators, students, and other professionals working in the Mid-Atlantic’s waters to learn general information about significant AIS, identify the problem species, collect specimens for verification, and report new infestations. The 99 species included in this field guide were selected by the Mid-Atlantic Panel on Aquatic Invasive Species. Experts compiled a list of species they felt were of most concern to the Mid-Atlantic region. Additional species may be included as needed in future iterations of the guide. Information on all reported species in the Mid-Atlantic Region can be found in the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database (http://nas.er.​usgs.gov/querie​s) and searching by major drainage area. The Mid-Atlantic is HUC2 number 2."
