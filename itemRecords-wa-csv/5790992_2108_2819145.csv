11,Abstract:,"The authors of this study sampled a series of hydrothermal event plumes resulting from eruptions along the North Gorda Ridge. Anaerobic thermophiles were cultured from plume samples at levels exceeding 200 organisms per liter; no thermophiles were cultured from any samples of background seawater. These microorganisms are probably members of a native subseafloor community that was present before the eruptive event. Seven coccoidal isolates from the plumes were partially characterized. Results from nutritional and phylogenetic studies indicate that these thermophiles are heterotrophic Archaea that represent new species, and probably a new genus within the Thermococcales."
