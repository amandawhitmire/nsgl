9,Abstract:,"From its birth in the oyster beds of Willapa Bay, Washington's oyster industry has grown to become the foundation of a vast shellfish enterprise. Today, over 9 million pounds of oyster meats are harvested each year from coastal areas throughout the state. Washington Sea Grant is currently working on a multi-part project to commemorate the struggles and triumphs of oyster culture in the Pacific Northwest, and to record the experiences of early industry leaders. This publication describes the project's goals, resources, and three products of the effort: a web site, a book, and a traveling exhibit."
