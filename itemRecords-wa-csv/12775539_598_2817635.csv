10,Abstract:,"Foraminifera, or forams, are single-celled organisms usually less than 0.5 mm in size, that live in the open ocean, along the coasts and in estuaries. Most of forams either float in the water column (planktonic) or live on the sea floor (benthic). The forams found here in Elliott Bay are all benthic, living in the sediment on the sea floor. Forams build their shells out of calcium carbonate (calcareous) or from tiny grains of sand stuck together (agglutinate). Many foraminifera are sensitive to changes in the physical parameters of their environment and thus they can be good indicators of pollution. By comparing foraminiferal assemblages from Elliott Bay with samples from less anthropogenicalâ€‹ly impacted locations within the Puget Sound, we can assess the degree of environmental damage to Elliott Bay."
