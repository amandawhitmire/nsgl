11,Abstract:,"The marine bacterium ""Streptomyces maritimus"" produces a structurally diverse series of bacteriostatic polyketides known as the enterocins and wailupemycins. This family of metabolites is possibly produced from a single biosynthetic pathway that has numerous metabolic options in creating molecular diversity. Does ""S. maritimus"" generate this unusual set of polyketides from a distinct pathway, and if so, what is the genetic organization of the encoding biosynthetic gene cluster? Examination of how metabolic diversity is generated in natural systems should provide insight into engineering a wide range of novel molecules through combinatorial biosynthesis. Southern blot hybridization analysis with a type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene probe revealed three distinct gene sets in the genome. End-sequencing of BamHI restriction fragments from corresponding cosmids identified a minimal PKS gene set (""enc"") clustered with relevant genes putatively involved in the formation of the benzoic acid starter unit. This research indicates that the ""enc"" gene set encodes one of the most versatile polyketide biosynthetic pathways investigated to date in naturally generating metabolic diversity. Its small size and novel features provide the foundation for engineering hybrid expression systems with more typical type II PKS gene sets in the production of diverse ranges of novel compounds for use in drug discovery. This work also represents the first expression of a marine bacterial polyketide in a terrestrial heterologous host and validates that marine bacterial metabolites can be produced in nonmarine expression systems."
