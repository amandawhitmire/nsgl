13,,"Three electrophoretic​ally separable forms of blood hemoglobin were found in salmon fry; ten hemoglobin forms were found in juvenile and adult salmon. Treatment of yearling salmon with triiodothyronin​e at 12 ppm in the diet accelerated the increase in concentration of adult forms of hemoglobin, while treatment at 4 ppm had no effect. Dietary propylthiouraci​l reduced the increases in adult forms of hemoglobin during smoltification. Results implicate thyroid hormones in the expression of adult forms of hemoglobin during the parr to smolt transformation of juvenile salmon."
