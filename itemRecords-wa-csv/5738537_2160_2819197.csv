13,Abstract:,"The authors quantified recruitment of young-​of-​the-​year (YOY) burrowing thalassinidean shrimp ""Neotrypaea californiensis"" to 2 habitats of differing structural complexity-​-​epibenthic bivalve shell and bare mudflat--and examined how differential settlement and post-settlement predation influence patterns of YOY abundance. Although other processes most likely contributed to patterns of YOY shrimp distribution, postlarval habitat selection for mud substrate was a key determinant of recruitment success. Recruitment patterns may be further modified by post- settlement mortality of YOY shrimp in shell due to YOY Dungeness crab predation."
