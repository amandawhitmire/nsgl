11,Abstract:,"In Port Townsend, Washington, learning through a sense of place is at the heart of our school district. Our small rural district, in a waterfront community, is three years into a five-year initiative that will transform it into a place-based, maritime-themed district—connec​ting all subjects and grade levels to the experiences of the local maritime community."
