11,Abstract:,"The synthesis of ribulose-​1,5-​bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. When Rubisco from eukaryotic plant taxa other than chlorophytes is examined, novel combinations of molecular and biochemical characteristics are observed. Based on morphological criteria it has been postulated that the rhodophytic (chl a, phycobilin-​containing) and chromophytic (chl a, c-containing) algae represent ancient evolutionary lineages that are quite distinct from chlorophytic plants. Chromophytes and probably rhodophytes encode Rubisco in a prokaryotic fashion, yet both synthesize an enzyme with a characteristic set of biochemical properties. In this study, the expression of ""Olisthodiscus luteus"" Rubisco at the level of transcription and assembly is analyzed. This communication is the first report that describes the synthesis of active eukaryotic Rubisco in ""Escherichia coli"". The mechanism of ""O. luteus"" Rubisco expression in-vivo and in ""E. coli"" appears to possess properties common to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes."
