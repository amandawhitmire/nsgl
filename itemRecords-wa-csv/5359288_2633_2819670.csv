15,,"Pathogenic strains of ""Vibrio anguillarum"" isolated from Pacific Northwest fish are able to grow under iron-limited conditions, withstand the bactericidal action of normal fish serum, and contain a virulence plasmid, pJM1. Here Atlantic vibrios are compared with their Pacific counterparts by phenetic and DNA homology assays and shown to be similar--with the curious exception that virulent strains harbored no plasmids (even while some non-virulent strains did)."
