13,Abstract:,"Crabs, as other crustaceans, grow by molting; as a consequence they do not have hard structures that could be used for absolute age determination. In the absence of such structures, time-​since-​last-​molt (shell age), combined with other data, could provide the information needed to assess growth and production. Here the authors report measurements of concentration of naturally occurring radionuclides, and discuss the estimation of Tanner and snow crab shell age by means of radiometric techniques."
