12,Abstract:,"Adverse environmental impacts on Dungeness crab populations from dredging and dredged material disposal, marina construction, and intertidal/subtâ€‹idal fill operations have become a major concern for fishermen and fisheries managers. Based on previous observations that shell deposits found in intertidal areas of Grays Harbor serve as a refuge for newly settled young-of-the- year (0+) crab, it was hypothesized that additional shell placed in the intertidal zone would augment and enhance existing habitat, thereby improving survival of juvenile 0+ crab, and an economical means of mitigating losses of older 1+ and larger crab during subtidal dredging might be achieved. Experimental trials are described here, with encouraging results."
