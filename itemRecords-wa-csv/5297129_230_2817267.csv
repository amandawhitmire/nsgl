14,Abstract:,"The timing of this workshop on the influence of ocean conditions on salmonid production could not have been more appropriate. Because of the devastating effects of the 1982-83 El Nino, ocean catches of coho and chinook salmon off Oregon and Washington were the worst in recent history. Runs of several salmon stocks in Alaska, on the other hand, were at or near record highs. Salmon biologists have never been more aware of the importance of the ocean environment on salmon production than today. This workshop, held at Newport, Oregon, on November 8-10, 1983, had two major objectives: first, to review our knowledge of the effects of the ocean environment on the production of salmonid stocks of the North Pacific Ocean, emphasizing mechanisms linking interannual trends in survival, growth, and migrations with ocean variability; second, ta identify important research needs in order to develop strategies for future investigations of salmonids in the ocean.
