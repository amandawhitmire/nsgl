10,Abstract:,"This book presents a coherent theoretical model linking geography, fish abundance, and population growth. It combines mathematical formulations of habitat selection and population density with standard population growth equations to create a geographic description of fish population dynamics. The key to the model is a well-known ecological concept called `density dependent habitat selection,' which is used at the population level to create a `basin model.' It treats abundance, productivity, movement, and distribution of fish as a function of habitat or environment, and casts the results in a way that allows easy geographic visualization of entire populations."
