10,Abstract:,"Historically, small-scale fishermen and processors along the southeastern United States have been an invisible industry. They earned a steady living supplying local residents and metropolitan areas of the Eastern Seaboard of the United States with quality, seasonal seafood without a well-recognized commercial image to identify their commodities or trade. As globalization began opening domestic markets to less expensive products, price became a deciding sales factor in consumer choices. Facing significant declines in market share and income, fishermen began abandoning their industry. Over the last decade, the demand for local seafood has grown stronger as consumers become more conscious of the origins of their food. The growing public demand for local seafood offers opportunities for producers to tap niche markets to stabilize and increase their incomes. This presentation will discuss how the Sea Grant network can offer practical guidance to help fishermen and processors build market-focused enterprises that create competitive advantages over foreign producers."
