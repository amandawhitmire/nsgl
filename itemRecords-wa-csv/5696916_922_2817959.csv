11,Abstract:,"Dungeness crabs, ""Cancer magister"", support the largest commercial crustacean fishery in the inland marine waters of Puget Sound, Washington State. Despite this, little is known about time and area of larval settlement, early life history, habitat requirements, or population dynamics of juvenile crabs from these waters. Postsettlement juvenile ""C. magister"" were examined in the inland waters of northern Puget Sound, Washington, to characterize interannual and seasonal patterns of settlement, density, and growth of ""C. magister"" in the intertidal zone, and to examine intertidal habitat use by juvenile crabs,"
