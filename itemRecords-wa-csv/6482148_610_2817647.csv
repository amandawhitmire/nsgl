13,Abstract:,"In March 2013, nearly 300 people from a wide range of fields gathered at the Third National Working Waterfronts and Waterways Symposium in Tacoma, Washington, to share ideas and information about working waterfronts. Coming from all coastal areas of the United States, participants represented the full spectrum of waterfront interests and shared a common concern for working waterfronts large and small. The 2013 symposium built upon ideas and suggestions gleaned from its two predecessors, held in 2007 and 2010. The following report provides an overview of the symposium and the key issues and lessons learned. The Symposium Host Committee hope that participants and colleagues will use this document to guide further discussions about working waterfronts both in the United States and internationally​. And we encourage you to share this information with others."
