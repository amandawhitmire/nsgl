9,Abstract:,"Previous research identified two abiotic elicitors from the bean pathogen ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. phaseoli capable of inducing total immunity in pea tissue to the pea pathogen ""F. solani"" f. sp. pisi and several of the major genes in this non-host resistance response pathway have been cloned. The non-host resistance response in pea appeared to involve multiple signaling routes, resulting in the transcription of the following pea genes: HMG I/Y (an AT hook protein which binds AT rich regions in promoter sequences regulating the genes), DRR206 and PR10 (accumulate in response to infection), and phenylalanine ammonia lyase and chalcone synthase (active enzymes in the phytoalexin pisatin synthesis pathway). In subsequent work, the major players in these multiple signaling pathways were reinvestigated by challenging pea tissue with an array of commercially available inhibitors of vital cell processes. It was found that the specific inhibitors of phosphatases were very efficient at inducing the synthesis of the phytoalexin pisatin. This present study evaluates how such signal disruption influences the gene activity of the immune response. The mRNA levels of these 5 genes were monitored following the challenge of the pea tissue with the phosphatase inhibitors, calyculin A and okadaic acid. Extremely low concentrations (as low as 4 pg/upsilon l) of these inhibitors induced copious quantities of pisatin (up to 533 upsilon g/g)) and caused increases in the mRNA specific for the 5 defense genes. It was previously determined that the level of the mRNA for the HMG I/Y gene was often low when the pea defense response was activated. To determine if the promoter of the HMG I/Y gene had AT- rich regions that could become a target of its own AT-rich hooks, a strategy was developed which was successful in identifying the DNA sequence of its promoter region. This region did indeed contain many AT-rich regions. Also, siRNAs were employed to specifically suppress HMG I/Y mRNA. The suppression of HMG I/Y was inefficient probably because of the difficulty in getting 25 bp oligomers to all their target cells in the multiple cell layers of the pea endocarp tissue."
