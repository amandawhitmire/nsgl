15,Abstract:,"Seven strains of ""Nocardia""-like bacteria were recently isolated from cultured Pacific oysters, ""Crassostrea gigas"" which experience summer mortality in several embayments in British Columbia and Washington. The biochemical, chemical, morphological and physiological properties of the isolates were essentially identical and served to distinguish them from representative Nocardiae. The authors propose that the strains isolated from the diseased Pacific oysters be assigned to a new species, ""Nocardia crassostrea""."
