9,Abstract:,"When seafoods are harvested, they may carry with them some of the contaminants of the waters from which they come. During transportation and processing, they are susceptible to additional contamination by microorganisms-​-​bacteria, yeasts, molds, and viruses. Microbiological contamination occurs most often when the seafoods are placed on unclean surfaces and when they are handled by people. This publication discusses retail store sanitation programs. Procedures on purchasing and receiving, storage and display are covered. Legal requirements are discussed and a list of references is provided."
