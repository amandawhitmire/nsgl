9,Abstract:,"To study the value of duckweeds for treatment of wastewater and to determine if the plants have value as animal feed, chemical content and nutritional value were determined for several species growing in natural fresh water areas, animal waste lagoons, effluent from a municipal treatment plant, and untreated septic tank effluent. One species, Spirodela oligorrhiza, growing on wastewater during winter months, had much higher nutritional value and mineral content than the same and similar species growing in natural waters. Laboratory growth data obtained by others and the chemical content of plants in this study were used to estimate that over 3,300 lb/yr (1,500 kg/yr) of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium would be removed annually and 30,000 lb/yr/acre (34,000 kg/yr/ha) of dry duckweed produced, with about 40 percent crude protein."
