12,Abstract:,"One of the peculiar commonplaces of our time is the realization that civilized life cannot continue in its present form. There has been surprisingly little discussion about how we can or should undertake institutional and political changes of the unprecedented scale and durability looming ahead of us. This book ventures to demonstrate how science and politics can, in the appropriate combination, be enlisted in the search for a sustainable material culture, and to describe cases showing how some elements in this search have been organized and tried out. At the core of the analysis is the idea of adaptive management. This book presents the case for a promising approach to social engineering, one that is undeniably difficult and expensive in important respects. The obstacles to a sustainable society are hard and heavy, and the levers short and frail. Learning how to move those obstacles is the first step."
