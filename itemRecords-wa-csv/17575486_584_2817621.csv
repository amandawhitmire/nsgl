14,Abstract:,"This report is one of three marine spatial planning (MSP) case study reports produced by the Coastal Resources Center/Rhode Island Sea Grant College Program (CRC) at the URI Graduate School of Oceanography. It is part of CRC’s broader ongoing research and capacity‐buildi​ng initiative to strengthen the network of marine spatial planning and coastal management practitioners. The purpose of the case studies is to document and share lessons learned from examples of marine spatial planning in the U.S. in order to build the capacity of MSP and coastal management practitioners. Research was conducted in three locations: Rhode Island, Washington State and San Francisco. The Rhode Island case focused on implementation of the Rhode Island Ocean Special Area Management Plan; the Washington case focused on the ongoing development of the Washington Coast Marine Spatial Plan; and the San Francisco study became a two‐case analysis of two different Coast Guard‐led waterways management initiatives. CRC has produced three technical reports summarizing case study research as well as a series of shorter publications highlighting key findings. Recent waterways management activities conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard in the San Francisco Bay region illustrate how marine spatial planning (MSP) can reduce conflict between human activities and natural resources and ensure marine events take place without interrupting maritime commerce or impacting the natural environment. This analysis of marine spatial planning in the San Francisco Bay region includes two case studies: (1) the Approaches to San Francisco Bay Port Access Route Study (PARS) (2009 ‐ 2013), and (2) the America’s Cup World Series and 34th America’s Cup races (2012 – 2013). The purpose of these case studies is to identify lessons learned that can inform future MSP practice. The cases also provide insights into the Coast Guard’s use of spatial planning and management techniques to manage busy waterways and illustrate how MSP practitioners can learn from the Coast Guard and partners’ experience."
