11,Abstract:,"In March 1968, the University of Washington received one of several Sea Grant Institutional Awards under the National Sea Grant College and Program Act. This program is directed toward development of marine resources and their proper use through rational management policies. For a long time, acoustical devices have been employed to locate exploitable stocks of fish, but, until quite recently, few attempts had been made to quantify signals reflected from fish or other marine organisms, although both the practical fishing industry and management agencies need numerical estimates. This report, written by two graduate students engaged in dissertation research, contains a brief description of the developed integrator and the calibration experiments on stocks of hake and herring in Puget Sound. A subsequent report will deal with population estimates of sockeye salmon in Lake Washington."
