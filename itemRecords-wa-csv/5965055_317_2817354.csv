9,Abstract:,"Residents in the vicinity of Hood Canal (Washington) are called upon to make choices that help protect this waterway. Homeowners can help by properly maintaining septic systems, using nontoxic gardening practices, and disposing of animal waste in a certified landfill. Those lucky enough to reside on the waterfront may be surprised to learn that growing shellfish on their beaches will contribute to water quality, as will planting a native vegetative buffer above the beach. Locals and visitors alike will learn something new from this 11 x 17"" poster."
