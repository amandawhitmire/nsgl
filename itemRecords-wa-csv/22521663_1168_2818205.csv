16,Abstract:,"Introduction: Shellfish aquaculture presents a sustainable alternative food source to satisfy global demands and conserve species at risk of over-harvest. Standard operations in shellfish aquaculture begin at a hatchery where adults are spawned and larvae are reared (figure 1). Early-life stages have an elevated sensitivity to unfavorable. conditions (e.g. diet, seawater chemistry, etc.) and pose a production limitation. A successful hatchery is largely dependent on accurate counts of phytoplankton batch cultures to estimate daily feeding routines, optimize shellfish production, and avoid sub-lethal harm during life-stages susceptible to overfeeding or starvation (figure 2). However, common techniques to quantify phytoplankton cultures place hatcheries at a detriment to labor intensive protocols and instrumentation​."
