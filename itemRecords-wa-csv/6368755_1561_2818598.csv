17,Abstract:,"A supplemental issue on the topic of single-​nucleotidepolym​orphism-​ enabled (SNP) research in nonmodel organisms is especially timely. In this issue, organisms with reference genomes are considered to be 'model'; 'nonmodel' organisms are those whose genomes are yet to be sequenced. Advances in DNA sequencing and SNP genotyping have provided profound insights into the genetics of model organisms, but until recently, studies of nonmodel species lagged behind because of the scarcity of sequence and markers (see Fig. 1). In the past year, Tautz et al. (2010) and associated papers in supplemental issue of Molecular Ecology described a revolutionary transition from studies of 'molecular ecology' to studies of 'ecological genomics'. Concurrently, Allendorf et al. (2010) grappled with placing the new-found wealth of sequence and SNP information into a 'conservation genomics' context. This revolution in molecular genetics studies would have been difficult to forecast a few years ago. Molecular genetic studies provide exceptional insight into relationships, migration and evolution of natural populations (Morin et al. 2004). During the origins of molecular ecology, in the 1960s and 1970s, it became clear that techniques such as allozyme electrophoresis would provide a basic framework for understanding species interactions and adaptation and for conserving natural genetic variability (Utter et al. 1966, 1974; Avise et al. 1975). Technical limitations at the time restricted both the ability to explore the dynamics of genetic diversity in species exhibiting low levels of variation as well as the direct analysis of adaptive variation in the wild. During the following years, innovators began to dream of potential applications for conservation and management of economically exploited species that included using molecular markers to determine the population- of-origin of migrating animals (see papers in Ryman & Utter 1987; Waples & Aebersold 1990), an important focus of many papers in this issue. Recent decades were punctuated by improvements in molecular and statistical techniques that produced an array of tools relevant to ecological and evolutionary studies such as assignment tests, estimates of effective population size, fine-scale population structure, kinship analyses (e.g. Helyar et al. this issue; Waples & Waples this issue) and genome-wide surveys based upon an ever increasing resolution of individuals and populations. The advantages of genotyping polymorphic SNPs with high-throughput assays have created much interest (Vignal et al. 2002; Brumfield et al. 2003; Morin et al. 2004; Schlo"" tterer 2004). Until recently, however, the scarcity of available DNA sequence data for nonmodel species limited marker development. Further, because of comparatively low mutation rates, cross-species amplification of primers for SNP analyses did not yield the same results as for microsatellites​. For example, Miller et al. (2010) tested the OvineSNP50 BeadChip, developed for domestic sheep, in two related ungulates and found only about 1% of the nearly 50 000 SNP loci to be polymorphic. Therefore, the SNP assays or probes developed for one species were not likely to be useful in others, even though primers may cross-amplify. The current supplemental issue contains 22 papers that underline the advantages of SNPs, advocate the need for SNP research in nonmodel organisms, and chart advances in discovery and applications. Although progress is apparent across a broad array of taxa, most papers presented here focus upon species of fish. This outcome, beyond the bias of the workshop organizers, may be in part because of the well-developed multinational collaborations that coordinate the sharing of DNA data on migratory species (Seeb et al. 2007; Martinsohn & Ogden 2009) as well as the economic and cultural importance of some of these species that fuels research efforts."
