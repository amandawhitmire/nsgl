12,Abstract:,"The vertebrate pituitary gland produces a family of chemically-​related glycoprotein hormones: thyroid-​stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Although pituitary TSH activity has been demonstrated clearly for representative species of all classes of vertebrates except clyclostomes, chemical characterizatio​n of purified TSH has been done for only a few mammalian species. In the tetrapod species which have been examined (except squamate reptiles) two gonadotropins (GTHs) exist: LH and FSH. In contrast, the number and identity of fish GTHs have been subjects of controversy. This paper briefly reviews studies of salmon pituitary glycoprotein hormones, with an emphasis on the GTHs. The physiological significance of a dual GTH system in salmonids is discussed."
