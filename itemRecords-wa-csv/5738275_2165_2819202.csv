12,Abstract:,"The inoculation of pea endocarp tissue with the bean pathogen ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli"" results in a nonhost resistance response causing a complete cessation of fungal growth within 6 to 8 hours. In addition to previously reported elicitation by chitosan, the authors now report that components of this response are also induced by a Dnase released from this fungus."
