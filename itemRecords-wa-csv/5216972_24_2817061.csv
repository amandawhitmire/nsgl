12,Abstract:,"Washington Sea Grant coordinates with other programs on state, academic, and industrial levels, and requires the active involvement of many people in the planning and operational processes. The resulting combination of effort is one of the unique aspects of Sea Grant and is an approach to marine resource development which is making a significant impact upon the needs of the marine community. In the chapters that follow, those needs which were addressed by Washington Sea Grant in 1974 are outlined and results reported."
