9,Abstract:,"If the commercial fishing industry is to survive and become a viable force in our economy, the cost of doing business must be reduced to a level more near that of its foreign competitors. The present cost of insurance coverage contributes disproportionat​ely to the overall cost of operating a fishing vessel. In discussing the problems plaguing the harvesting segment of the domestic fishing industry, it is sometimes difficult to separate and identify causes and effects, fundamental troubles from their manifestations. The problems can be interrelated in complex ways. Insurance rates are high and are getting higher. In the course of this paper we shall attempt to explore this problem, to discover to what extent it causes and is caused by other problems, and to examine and evaluate several possible methods of resolution."
