17,Abstract:,"The estuary of the Elwha River, on Washington's Olympic Peninsula, has been degraded and simplified over the past century from sediment retention behind two large dams, levee construction, and channelization. With the removal of Elwha Dam and initiation of Glines Canyon Dam's removal in fall 2011, sediment deposits will change the estuary and affect anadromous and nearshore marine fishes. Juvenile Chinook salmon commonly use estuaries and the river's population is part of an Evolutionarily Significant Unit listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. This study reports on monthly sampling in part of the river's estuary from March 2007 through September 2011 to characterize the seasonal changes in relative abundance of yearlings and sub-yearlings, and size distributions prior to dam removal. Most (69 %) of the yearlings were caught in April, when this life history type was released from the hatchery, and to a lesser extent in May (28 %) and June (3 %). Yearlings caught in the estuary were smaller than those released from the hatchery (means: 153 mm�28 SD vs. 175 mm�5 SD), suggesting more rapid departure by larger fish. Sub-yearlings were much more abundant in the estuary, and were caught from March through November, increasing in mean fork length by 8.7 mm month-1. The hatchery-origin subyearlings were not marked externally and so were not distinguishable from natural origin fish. However, 39 % of the sub-yearlings were caught prior to June, when sub-yearlings were released from the hatchery, indicating substantial use of the estuary by natural-origin fish. Thus, even in a reduced state after a century of dam operation, the highly modified estuary was used over many months by juvenile Chinook salmon. The information on juvenile Chinook salmon prior to dam removal provides a basis for comparison to patterns in the future, when the anticipated increase in estuarine complexity may further enhance habitat use by juvenile Chinook salmon."
