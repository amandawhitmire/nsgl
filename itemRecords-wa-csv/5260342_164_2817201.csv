14,Abstract:,"The School of Oceanography, Oregon State University, conducted three cruises (May 19-June 2, June 7-22, and September 4-14) in 1982 to study the distribution, abundance, migration, growth and feeding habits of juvenile salmonids during their first summer in the ocean. This is the second year we have had a series of cruises during the summer months and the fourth year that we have sampled the Oregon and Washington coasts during June. The purpose of this report is to describe the sampling area and methods used for the 1982 cruises and to present some preliminary results."
