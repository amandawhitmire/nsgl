13,Abstract:,"The Sea Grant network involves universities and their partners across the nation; programs are continually learning from each other and collaborating to enhance research and outreach efforts. Washington Sea Grant benefits from close interaction with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (three major NOAA laboratories and several other NOAA offices are located in Seattle), with other federal agencies, and with laboratories, scientists and resource managers in nearby British Columbia, Canada. In the pages of this directory, you'll find brief descriptions of current and continuing research and outreach projects for the 1998 - 2000 funding period. Research topics include sustainable fisheries and living marine resources, aquaculture, marine policy, marine products and biotechnology, and estuarine studies."
