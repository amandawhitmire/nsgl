11,,"The author of this work examines the role of landcape architects in ecological landscape design, particularly in light of increasing citizen-based efforts to promote the self-renewal of human-altered areas. The success of landscape restoration is outlined in Seattle-area case studies, and the concept of partnership with, rather than stewardship of, the landscape is explored philosophically and practically."
