12,Abstract:,"The authors evaluate the potential competitive and predatory impacts of nonindigenous European green crab ""Carcinus maenas"" on native Dungeness crab ""Cancer magister"" in the northeast Pacific. Laboratory experiments and infrared video observation revealed that juvenile green crabs displace Dungeness crab of equal size from shelters during one-on-one competition. Green crab also consistently win nocturnal foraging trials in which the species compete for damaged clams. Field and laboratory enclosure experiments show that juvenile Dungeness crab emigrate from oyster shell habitat as a result of competition and predation by adult green crab. Depending on the extent to which the two species overlap, interactions with the dominant nonindigenous species could have a negative influence on juvenile Dungeness crab survival and could conceivably impact recruitment to the fishery."
