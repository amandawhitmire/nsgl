10,Abstract:,"Like all other living creatures, finfish and shellfish are capable of harboring parasites. Commercial fish processing procedures such as canning and freezing inactivate parasites. As a result, illness from consuming fish containing live parasites is very low in the United States. The four parasites that more often cause harm to humans if ingested alive-​-​""Anisakis simplex"", ""Pseudoterranov​a decipiens"", ""Diphyllobothri​um spp."", and ""Nanophyetus salmincola""-​-​are described here, along with their most common hosts and guidelines for their inactivation or eradication."
