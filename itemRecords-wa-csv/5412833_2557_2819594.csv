7,Abstract:,"Louisiana contains 1.7 million hectares of coastal marsh and is losing almost one percent of these wetlands each year to coastal erosion and subsidence. The only significant exceptions are the formation of fresh marshes and mudflats in the Atchafalaya River Delta and the revitalization of previously eroded marsh habitat in wetlands peripheral to this delta system. This fresh marsh ecosystem is administered as a State Wildlife Management Area but is also subjected to pressures associated with flood control, navigation, and mineral extraction. Federal and state agencies interact with industry and the public sector in implementing multiple utilization of the area. Several examples are presented, showing a range of interactions from pre-permit agreements to litigation. A professional, unbiased approach by university scientists has fostered a close working relationship with scientists, engineers, and resource managers involved in multiuse conflict and management decisions."
