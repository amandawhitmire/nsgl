10,Abstract:,"The objective of this conference was to bring together researchers, engineers, manufacturers, and prospective users of floating breakwaters, so that the latest developments could be disseminated to the widest audience possible. In addition, there was need for the interchange of ideas, discussion of different approaches, use of materials and construction methods. Finally it was hoped that the problem of duplication of effort and overlap of work could be eliminated. The following papers were presented at this conference: 1) Floating breakwaters-​state of the art, E.P. Richey and R.E. Nece, pp. 1-19; 2) Theoretical analysis of floating breakwater performance, B.H. Adee and W. Martin, pp. 21-39; 3) The effect of surge, heave and pitch on the performance of a floating breakwater, A.A. Sutko and E.L. Haden, pp. 41-53; 4) Tethered float breakwaters, R..J. Seymour and J.D. Isaacs, pp. 55-72; 5) The peformance of an offset breakwater on configuration in wind-generated waves, E.D. Sethness, Jr., W.L. Moore, and D. Sabathier, pp. 73-90; 6) A wave barrier concept, W.W. Bowley, pp. 91-112; 7) Development of hermaphrodite breakwater units utilizing hydrofoils in specific arrangements, K.P.H. Frey, pp. 113-129; 8) Attenuation of wind-generated deep water waves by pneumatic and hydraulic breakwaters, J.M. Colonell, C.E. Carver, Jr., and J.M. Lacouture, pp. 131-158; 9) Prototype performance characteristics of a floating breakwater, D.R. Christensen and E.P. Richey, pp. 159-179; 10) The ""Seabreaker"" floating breakwater, H.G. Hasler, pp. 181-191; 11) Goodyear scrap tire floating breakwater concepts, R.M. Candle, pp. 193-211; 12) The Harris floating breakwater, A.J. Harris and J.M. Thomas, pp. 213-232; 13) Scrap tire floating breakwaters, T. Kowalski, pp. 233-246; 14) Materials and construction techniques for floating breakwaters, D.S. Miller, pp. 247-261; 15) Practical applications of floating breakwaters for small craft harbors, D.S. Miller, pp. 263-277; 16) Workshop I: Future uses of floating breakwaters, pp. 279-280; 17) Workshop II: Floating breakwaters for small boat marinas, pp. 281-282; 18) A chronological survey of the literature on transportable and floating breakwaters, O.M. Griffin and D.B. Jones, pp. 283-296; 19) Suggested nomenclature, T. Kowalski, pp. 297-298."
