8,Abstract:,"Many of the problems facing fisheries managers are solvable only through application of new technologies. A striking example is the sector scanning sonar, the first of which was developed in the 1950s at a cost of over one million dollars. However, several models are now commercially available for under $50,000 and they are becoming widely used in commercial fisheries, although their use by fisheries scientists is still limited. A similar technological and economic status currently applies to the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). Developmental costs have been underwritten by military, oil and related industries, and ROVs are now available at costs which are economically feasible for fisheries scientists. This paper explores several potential applications of this technology in the field of fisheries."
