13,Abstract:,"Estuarine frontal systems, which typically are distinguished by striking changes in water color and foam lines containing floating debris and high concentrations of organisms, are commonly found throughout the world. This study tests the ""larval conduit"" theory, which suggests that larvae collected at the front are funneled to settlement locations. The authors quantified the effects of frontal structure on the distribution and transport potential of Dungeness crab, ""Cancer magister"" megalopae, during springtime recruitment pulses. Variable wind stress combined with front effects could significantly influence spatial variation and resettlement."
