9,Abstract:,"This report provides basic information on oyster species biology, state agency requirements for growing oysters, and some commercial applications that can be adapted to small farm situations. Although most people are concerned primarily with siting, methodology, and economics, it is important to be aware that these are intertwined with biology. Successful farming will depend on balancing these aspects, being observant, using imagination, and following just plain common sense."
