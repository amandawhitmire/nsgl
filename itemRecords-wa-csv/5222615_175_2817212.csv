11,Abstract:,"Puget Sound is an important natural resource for citizens in Washington. As demands have increased for the variety of uses for which it is suited, conflict has arisen over its use and concern has been felt lest some uses destroy the Sound's potential for other more valuable uses. This study is an attempt to understand the processes by which Puget Sound's land and water uses are determined so that those processes can be continually improved.
