10,Abstract:,"Although light signals are highly effective in controlling cellular division and chloroplast biogenesis in the toxic marine alga ""Heterosigma carterae"", their influence on gene expression has not been well characterized. In this study, cultures of ""H. carterae"" synchronized by an alternating light-dark regime were sampled through 12 h of light and 12 h of dark to characterize cell division, chloroplast complement, and chloroplast RNA abundance. Results suggest that the chloroplast transcriptional apparatus of ""H. carterae"" may initiate a rapid, temporally gated response to a change in photoperiod that is independent of ongoing light-entrained cellular and chloroplast division cycles."
