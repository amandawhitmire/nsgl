12,Abstract:,"This study summarizes results from a series of trawl surveys of Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, and the adjacent nearshore, 1985-88. Previous work has shown that these estuaries provide critical nursery habitat for juvenile English sole during their first year of life. In this paper, growth and survival rates are estimated by using data from field surveys, and the authors investigate statistically the effects of population size and ambient temperature on the growth and survival of juvenile English sole."
