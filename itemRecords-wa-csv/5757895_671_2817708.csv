13,Abstract:,"The ghost shrimp and the mud shrimp dig extensive gallery systems in intertidal and subtidal soft sediments and are widely distributed in estuaries along the Pacific Coast of North America. Aquaculture operations and particularly on- bottom oyster culture require substrate that is sufficiently firm (compact) to support the weight of growing oysters and prevent mortality from sinking and suffocation. Burrowing activity by the shrimp reduces substrate compaction, causing oysters to sink into the altered substrate or to be smothered by sediment. From the outset of a large-scale shrimp control program in Washington in 1963 until 1984, carbaryl was applied at 11.2 kg/ha. With increased use and increased public concern over its use, the Washington Department of Fisheries began experiments to investigate the potential for decreasing the amount of chemical introduced into the environment by reducing the application rate. The experiments reported here represent a more detailed exploration of carbaryl application rate, with the explicit objective of linking control to ecology of the two shrimp species. This study also provides the first quantified estimate of oyster loss due to shrimp bioturbation."
