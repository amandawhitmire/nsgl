11,Abstract:,"In 1970, the Washington Sea Grant program initiated project NORFISH for the purpose of providing a channel between technical methods developed or studied at the University of Washington and the management agencies with marine resource problems on which those methods might have a bearing. In furtherance of that goal and in anticipation of possible increased chum salmon production in Washington State for commercial use, the authors of this report undertook a comparative study of chum production in Washington and Japan. Their findings are reported here."
