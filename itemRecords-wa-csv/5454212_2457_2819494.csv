9,Abstract:,"With the seaward extension of national jurisdictions has come an impetus for exploring and developing these expanded frontiers. Ironically, the act that can overnight virtually double a nation's territorial claims can also inhibit oceanographic research that could provide a foundation for conserving, developing, and managing the resources therein. In this installment of the McKernan lecture series, the author outlines the emerging constraints on international marine research, looks at the response of the marine science community to them, and offers some thoughts on the future of marine research under this new regime."
