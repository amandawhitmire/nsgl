11,Abstract:,"Seabirds are often cited as indicators of relative productivity and health of the marine environment. The degree to which physical forcing plays a dominant role and the mechanisms of effect remain unclear. Here scientists test the relationship between measures of oceanographic and atmospheric forcing and the response of populations of a ubiquitous seabird of the Pacific Northwest, the common murre ""Uria aalge"". They constructed two models: an annualized bottom-up model that examines the degree to which population response variables, including population size, breeding success, and foraging parameters, are correlated with oceanographic forcing at space and time scales relevant to murre biology; and a daily direct forcing model that examines the degree to which diet choices reflect specific, local oceanographic signals. The bottom-up model suggests that murres are regulated by bottom-up forcing, and that the strength of the association between physical change and population response may be mediated by density dependence. The direct forcing model indicated that chick diet is affected by both local and remote parameters, including upwelling, tide, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The authors conclude that murres, and seabirds in general, can be used as indicators of local to basinwide physical change, but only under certain conditions, delineated here."
