17,Abstract:,"Pesticide contamination of surface waters has been a global concern for decades. In agricultural areas, pesticides enter receiving waters through irrigation and storm runoff, spray drift, or even atmospheric deposition. Management practices incorporating vegetation and phytoremediatio​n have demonstrated success in reducing pesticide loads to rivers, lakes, and streams. This chapter will focus on a variety of vegetative management practices (e.g. constructed wetlands, drainage ditches, and rice fields) which have been studied in the intensively cultivated Mississippi Delta. Summaries of research results will be presented, as well as potential future directions for additional research."
