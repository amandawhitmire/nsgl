11,Abstract:,"We present morphological observations on two very small vampire squids. One, a trawl-caught hatchling of 8 mm mantle length (ML), had embryonic features including internal yolk, broad arm-like filaments, and lack of mantle-head fusion. The other was a 9 mm ML paralarva collected by submersible and photographed alive aboard ship. Although only slightly larger than the hatchling, its morphology was much more like that of larger specimens than that of the hatchling, except for the oblique orientation of its fins."
