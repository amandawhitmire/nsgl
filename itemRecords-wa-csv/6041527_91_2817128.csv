Funds are routed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research to the Rhode Island Sea Grant College Program at the University of Rhode Island (URI) and managed by David Alves, Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) state aquaculture initiative coordinator, assisted by Barry A. Costa-Pierce, Rhode Island Sea Grant director, and Ames Colt, Rhode Island Sea Grant assistant director. Rhode Island Sea Grant reports to tire NOAA-Sea Grant Project Manager, Jim McVey, in Washington, D.C. CRMC has signed a memorandum of understanding with Rhode Island Sea Grant, the University of Rhode Island, and Roger Williams University to manage this project."
