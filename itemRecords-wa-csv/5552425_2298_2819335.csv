11,Abstract:,"The dynamics of competing populations are investigated using discrete non-linear models with age structure. Necessary and sufficient stability conditions for the coexistence equilibrium between competing species are developed. Harvesting can lead to the extinction of one of a pair of competing species, or to loss of genetic diversity in a panmictic population. When catchability increases sufficiently with body size, then harvesting preferentially removes the most productive genotypes, causing a reduction in the maximum sustainable yield of the population. Harvesting can also reverse the relative fitness of genotypes, since a rare inferior genotype in an unexploited population may be more fit under fishing."
