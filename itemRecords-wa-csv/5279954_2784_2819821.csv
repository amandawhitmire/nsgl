11,Abstract:,"An analysis of Lake Erie water quality data for the past 10 years indicates a general improvement in the lake environment. Concentrations of phosphorus were relatively constant during the period 1970 to 1977; however, since that time significant declines have been observed. This improvement coincides with the approximate 800-​metric-​ton-​per-​year reduction in the phosphorus loading to the lake during the later part of  the decade."
