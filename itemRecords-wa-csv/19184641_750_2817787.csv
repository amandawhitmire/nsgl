9,Abstract:,"At the request of Greater Grays Harbor, Inc., the Chamber of Commerce and the Economic Development Council for Grays Harbor County, a study of the retail sector in Grays Harbor County was conducted. The purpose of this analysis was to develop a retail gap analysis to help identify potential opportunities within the retail sector for Grays Harbor County. This information can be used to assist with creating a retail development strategy. Coastal communities in Washington State provide vital economic, social and recreational opportunities. To assist with developing vibrant and resilient coastal communities, local planning groups need access to information that helps them understand the value of tourism and marine-related economic activities. A key to both of these industries is the retail sector, which is particularly salient in Grays Harbor County, a region in the midst of a transition from an economy based on resource extraction to one based on recreation and tourism. This report focuses on six trade areas*: (1) Grays Harbor County (GHC), (2) Northwest GHC, (3) Central GHC, (4) Northeast GHC, (5) Southwest GHC and (6) Southeast GHC (Figure 1). These areas were defined by census tract rather than drive time or distance radius to make sure that residents within non-census designated places were counted, to account for the rural nature of region where drive time is less of a factor, and to stay within the defined study area. This study identifies potential retail opportunities in Grays Harbor County, Washington. Within the county, the retail sector has more businesses than any other industry with 13.9% of the total, and also has the second highest number of employees with 12.2% of total employment. The northwest and central regions of the county have the greatest proportion of retail businesses with 16.9% of all businesses in their regions. The southwest region of the county has the highest proportion of retail employees with 15.9% of all employees in the region. Based on the retail gap analysis, the top three industries identified as providing the greatest retail potential in the region include (1) general merchandise stores, (2) clothing and clothing accessories stores and (3) health and personal care stores."
