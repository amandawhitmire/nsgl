13,Abstract:,"This paper examines factors related to long-term changes in production in the subarctic Pacific Ocean, using examples mainly form Station P (50 deg. N, 145 deg. W). The authors examine, in particular, trends in zooplankton biomass as an indicator of changes in productivity in this oceanic ecosystem. Using time-series analysis, they then compare these trends to those evident in the offshore region of the California Current to examine the hypothesis that production in both systems may be affected by an influx of water from the Subarctic Current. They examine physical data relevant to regime-shift changes in flow between the Alaska Current and California Current. Finally, they discuss implications of regime shifts to higher trophic levels and suggest new hypotheses and further studies that could be undertaken to address these hypotheses."
