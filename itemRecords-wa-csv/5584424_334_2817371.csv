10,Abstract:,"Twenty years ago, some far-seeing citizens of Washington State drafted an initiative to protect and manage the State's shorelines. Washington's voters affirmed the need for statewide shorelines management and chose the Legislature's alternative initiative to achieve it. The public-spirited efforts of those citizens, the responsiveness of their Legislature, and the leadership of their governor resulted in one of the nation's pioneering shoreline management programs. Twenty years later, more than 200 Washingtonians gathered at a symposium to celebrate two decades of shoreline management in their state, and to honor some of those responsible for the passage and implementation of the state's Shoreline Management Act of 1971. Participants in the Shorelines Management Symposium had the opportunity to learn about and assess what had been achieved under the Shoreline Management Act. They also looked ahead to the challenges the state's shoreline managers will face over the next 20 years, and considered whether or not the 20-year-old Shoreline Management Act will be sufficient to meet them. This proceedings documents the stories, ideas, and observations which symposium participants heard during one and a half days of plenary and break-out sessions."
