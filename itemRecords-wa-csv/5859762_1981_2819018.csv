10,Abstract:,"A companion guide to ""The Sound: Puget Sound Multimedia CD- ROM,"" this tutorial guide helps teachers use the CD-ROM in the classroom while addressing some of Washington State's Essential Academic Learning Requirements. Focusing on student-â€‹centered learning and environmental science, the tutorial includes five modules that correspond with the CD- ROM pull down menus, classroom writing and modeling exercises, and Internet resources for additional studies. The broader topics of the curriculum are: properties (geology, meteorology, circulation, bathymetry); ecosystems; species; status (air and water quality, waste); and marine affairs (culture, economics, law)."
