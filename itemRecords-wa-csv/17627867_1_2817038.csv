8,Abstract:,"The Sea Grant Strategic Plan Impiementation Committee assembled and reviewed all of the reports resulting from the Sea Grant Week '95 planning meeting in Puerto Rico and met in December 1995 in Washington, D.C., to craft an implementation plan that it hoped would be of use to everyone in the Sea Grant Network- individual Sea Grant programs, the National Sea Grant Office (NSGO) and the National Review Panel Prior to Sea Grant Week '95, the Sea Grant community received documents that contained background information for implementation planning and were divided into subcommittees that addressed four areas of interest: Economic Leadership, Coastal Ecosystem Health and Public Safety, Education and Human Resources, and Sea Grant in the 21st Century. These areas of interest basically followed those that previously had been presented in Sea Grant's Strategic Plan 1995-2005 (Apri11995 draft) and subsequently were published as the Sea Grant Network Plan 1995-2005 (see outline summary on pp. x-xi). Each subcommittee was then asked to submit its recommendationsâ€‹ to the Strategic Plan Implementation Committee for integration into a single document. After considerable discussion, the committee decided that it would be impractical to write an implementation plan for the entire network, particularly one based on its discussions and documents from the Puerto Rico meeting. To effectively represent all Sea Grant programs, such a document would have to be very broad in its coverage; a resulting plan would also most likely be of limited value to everyone. We also felt that it was presumptuous for the committee to prescribe implementation elements that were very important to a particular program, yet of only local or regional interest. Such plans are best developed either at the individual pro gram level, or regionally. The committee did feel strongly, however, that it would be desirable for every program to develop an implementation plan. We also felt that a reasonably uniform approach by all programs, as well as for the NSGO, would be desirable. These implementation plans are meant to serve as a management tool for each program, as a means of planning cooperative ventures among programs and as a framework for the NSGO to assist in the coordination of activities among the national programs. Furthermore, the NSGO could then use these plans, together with the research subcommittee in the new Sea Grant Association structure, to develop new initiatives. With these caveats in mind, the committee developed a set of guiding principles and an implementation plan outline that provides a framework for each pro gram to use in its planning activities. The intended audiences include: (1) individual Sea Grant programs; (2) the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), specifically the NSGO and NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research; (3) the Sea Grant network and other Sea Grant partners; (4) other science agencies; and (5) Sea Grant constituency groups."
