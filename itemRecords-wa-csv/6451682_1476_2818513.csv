21,Abstract:,"An underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) was designed, built, and tested for 2013's UNH ROV team. UNH ROV is an interdisciplina​ry senior design project team that focuses on building a ROV for competition and research based aspects. This year's ROV team has built a ROV that will compete in the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) competition that will be held in Seattle, Washington on June, 20 2013. The ROV will also be used in a graduate research project where two ROVs will be controlled in a leader-follower type fashion to perform tasks underwater."
