10,Abstract:,"These researchers hypothesize that regional variability in salmon production is driven by large-scale climate change, reflected in North Pacific atmospheric-​oceanic regime shifts. Under this hypothesis, salmon populations exhibit two characteristics​: relatively stable production while a particular regime persists, followed by a rapid transition to a new production level in response to the physical regime shift. The hypothesis suggests that two shifts in Alaskan salmon production should be detectable: a decrease in the late 1940s and an increase in the late 1970s. Using intervention analysis, researchers identified a highly signficant positive step intervention in the late 1970s and a significant negative step intervention in the late 1940s in the four major Alaska salmon stocks analyzed."
