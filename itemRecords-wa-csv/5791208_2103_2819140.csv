12,Abstract:,"This study investigates the nutritional roles of two naturally occurring dinoflagellatesâ€‹, the autotrophic ""Prorocentrum micans"" and the heterotrophic ""Noctiluca scintillans,"" and the green alga ""Dunaliella tertiolecta"" in the first zoeal stage of the Dungeness crab ""Cancer magister"". Results showed that these types of prey alone do not offer adequate nutrition for development to the second zoeal stage, but that in combination with the nauplii of the brine shrimp ""Artemia"" sp., protistan prey promote a rate of survival to zoeal stage II equal to that of the control group (which were fed nauplii continuously)."
