15,Abstract:,"Previously, the authors reported on the structures of the major depsipeptides, salinamides A and B, isolated from ""Streptomyces"" sp. CNB-091, an actinomycete isolated from the surface of the jellyfish ""Cassiopeia xamachana"" collected from the Florida Keys. Salinamides A and B exhibit moderated antibiotic activity and show potent topical antiinflammator​y activity. Salinamide A has been shown to exhibit strong inhibitory activity against bacterial RNA polymerases. In this paper, the authors describe the entire spectrum of salinamides isolated from ""Streptomyces"" sp. CNB-091 and amend the absolute configurations of salinamides A and B."
