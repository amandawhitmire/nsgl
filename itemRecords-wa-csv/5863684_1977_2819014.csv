10,Abstract:,"The author describes the research of microbiologists and others at several northwest universities into extremophiles, organisms that flourish in astonishingly harsh conditions. The origins of life on earth, the specifics of biological adaptations to extreme temperatures or environments, genetic mapping, and potential commercial applications are some of the broad areas of investigation currently being pursued."
