10,Abstract:,"The Pacific Northwest Coastal Ecosystems Regional Study (PNCERS) program seeks to clarify how human activities have affected nearshore environments and to identify mechanisms through which natural and human-induced change can affect regional economies and social systems. This newsletter discusses the preliminary findings of some ongoing studies in Washington and Oregon. Topics include a computer model for property values, the bureaucratic web, public and industry perceptions of marine resource issues and governance, and quantification of demographic and economic changes in coastal communities."
