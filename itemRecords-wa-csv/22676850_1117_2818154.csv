12,Abstract:,"In coastal habitats, mussels are exposed to microplastics (MP; plastic 0.1 μm–5 mm) and silt, two abiotic particles that are similarly sized and lack nutrition. The addition of MP or silt may change the functional response of mussels. We measured clearance rate (CR) of Mytilus trossulus in three particle treatments (algae, MP + algae, and silt + algae) across four concentrations to (1) determine if the effects of MP and silt are similar and (2) disentangle the effects of particle type, particle concentration, and proportion of abiotic particles. CR decreased by 62% at high MP concentrations (> 1250 particles mL−1 ) but was not affected at equivalent silt concentrations. These findings suggest high MP concentrations inhibit mussel CR, more than expected by changes in particle concentration or the proportion of abiotic particles. As plastic production increases, mussel exposure to MP will increase, potentially reducing energy transfer, benthic-pelagic coupling, and water clarity."
13,,"Scientific Significance Statement: Microplastic is a rising form of marine pollution and interacts with numerous organisms, such as suspension-​feeding mussels. Mussels can filter microalgae, natural sediment like silt, and now, microplastic. Microplastic is known to have some negative effects on mussels at high concentrations but it remains unclear if microplastic inhibits feeding processes. We found evidence that mussel clearance rate (CR) is inhibited under high concentrations of microplastic and not by similar concentrations of other abiotic particle or current levels of microplastics in nature. Decreased mussel CRs could have important consequences at the ecosystem level, such as reducing water clarity and benthic-pelagic coupling."
