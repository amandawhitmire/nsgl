11,Abstract:,"The isolation of induced pea genes in response to ""Fusarium"" inoculations has previously been reported. In this paper, two cDNAs have been sequenced and characterized whose mRNA accumulates somewhat differently upon fungal challenge. The genes appear to encode low molecular weight proteins with a high content of cysteine residues. Computer searches have revealed only low homology between their sequence predicted proteins and other known proteins; however, they share some similarities with the fungal-toxic thionins. Thionins are low molecular weight cysteine-rich proteins that accumulate in barley after challenge by pathogenic fungi. The properties of these pea proteins and other cysteine-rich proteins are discussed."
