12,Abstract:,Managing fish populations for optimum yield requires that each stock be indentified and managed separately. Walleye pollock currently comprises the most productive single species fishery in the world with annual harvests in excess of 6 million tons. This study reports the spawning distributions of walleye pollock observed during 1985 in the eastern Bering Sea. It describes larval distributions from 1963 to the present and summarizes juvenile collections made in 1987. This information is critically examined with respect to current hypotheses on stock structure.
