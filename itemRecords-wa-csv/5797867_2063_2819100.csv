11,Abstract:,"Size influences reproductive success in diverse taxa. Because egg production in ""Eogammarus oclairi"" is correlated with female size and previous information shows that larger males pair with larger females, it can be hypothesized that large size is advantageous in males and subject to sexual selection, and will result in selection for larger males. This project assessed whether assortative mating occurs in ""E. oclairi"", and studied the alternative processes that may generate assortativenessâ€‹. In particular, the effects of male behavior, current velocity, habitat heterogeneity, and random assortment were studied."
