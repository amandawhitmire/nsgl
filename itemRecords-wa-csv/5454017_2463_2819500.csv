9,Abstract:,"Contamination of ready-to-eat food products by the bacterium ""Listeria monocytogenes"" can be a serious threat to public health. This bacterium causes a food-borne disease called listeriosis in susceptible individuals. While healthy people may only suffer flu-like symptoms, pregnant women, newborn infants, recent mothers and immuno-​compromised individuals are exposed to a very high fatality risk (as high as 45 percent). Surveys conducted by the Center for Disease Control indicate that listeriosis is far more common than previously realized. Potential risks to seafood processors resulting from problems related to ""Listeria monocytogenes"" can be minimized by an awareness of the problem and by maintaining a high performance level in sanitation and process control. This publication provides an overview of the problem and some preventative measures."
