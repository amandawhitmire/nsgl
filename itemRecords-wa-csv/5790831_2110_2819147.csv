11,Abstract:,"In the pea plant (""Pisum sativum""), compounds that intercalate into DNA induce the production of approximately 20 major proteins similar to the pattern induced during nonhost disease resistance to the bean fungal pathogen. ""Fusarium solani"" f.sp.""phaseoli""â€‹. The pea phytoalexin, pisatin, as well as RNA homologous to several disease- resistance response (DRR) genes accumulate following treatment with these compounds. Psoralen intercalates into DNA and, following irradiation with 365 nm UV light, strands of DNA. This produces monoadducts or cross-links, respectively. DRR genes were examined after ""in vivo"" psoralen treatment. The rate of crosslinking was compared between fungal-induced and noninduced genes using a modified Southern blot analysis. Implications of the induction of the DRR due to psoralen binding are discussed."
