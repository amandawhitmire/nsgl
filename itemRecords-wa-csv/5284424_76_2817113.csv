12,Abstract:,"Since the last joint industry/Sea Grant moorage workshop, held in April 1977, many unforeseen changes have occurred in both the political and economic environments. These changes have affected and will continue to affect the way marinas operate and prosper. Inflation and high interest rates have levied a toll on boat sales--and hence on the growth in demand for pleasure boat moorage--and have pushed construction and long-term financing costs to record high levels. Legislation proposed by the Reagan Administration would levy user charges against boaters and marina operators consuming federal waterway services: Coast Guard search and rescue and navigation aid functions and Army Corps of Engineers harbor and waterway dredging projects have been singled out for recovery of costs from users. Such changes necessitate and promote innovation and adaption on the part of the moorage industry . There are other factors, however, that have changed little since 1977. Tile same regulatory framework affecting marina development is in place: Shoreline Management, Corps of Engineers, and other permit requirements constrain development over and adjacent to waterways. Boating interests have continued to forestall state boat registration and new tax measures proposed by the state legislature. These are among the issues taken up by speakers at this workshop. Their papers form the body of these proceedings. Since 19/7 the Washington Sea Grant Program has conducted a series of studies which have better defined the recreational boating industry, its problems and opportunities, and the likely future demand for recreational and commercial fishing boat moorage. This work was supported in part by the Northwest Marine Trade Association and the Washington Public Ports Association. Both these organizations joined Washington Sea Grant in co-​sponsoring this workshop,"
