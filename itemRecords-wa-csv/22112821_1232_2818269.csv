25,Abstract:,"Increasing recognition of the human dimensions of natural resource management issues, and of social andecological sustainability and resilience as being inter-related, highlights the importance of applying socialscience to natural resource management decision-​making. Moreover, a number of laws and regulations requirenatural resource management agencies to consider the “best available science” (BAS) when making decisions,inclu​ding social science. Yet rarely do these laws and regulations define or identify standards for BAS, and thosewho have tried to fill the gap have done so from the standpoint of best available natural science. This paperproposes evaluative criteria for best available social science (BASS), explaining why a broader set of criteria thanthose used for natural science is needed. Although the natural and social sciences share many of the sameevaluative criteria for BAS, they also exhibit some differences, especially where qualitative social science isconcerned. Thus we argue that the evaluative criteria for BAS should expand to include those associated withdiverse social science disciplines, particularly the qualitative social sciences. We provide one example from theUSA of how a federal agency −the U.S. Forest Service −has attempted to incorporate BASS in responding to itsBAS mandate associated with the national forest planning process, drawing on different types of scientificinfor​mation and in light of these criteria. Greater attention to including BASS in natural resource managementdecis​ion-​making can contribute to better, more equitable, and more defensible management decisions andpolicies."
