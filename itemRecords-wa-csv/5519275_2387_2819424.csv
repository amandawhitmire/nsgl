10,Abstract:,"Captive striped bass and red drum brood fish were implanted with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags for long-term individual identification and monitoring of growth, survival and spawning success. Injection wounds on all fish healed quickly and no behavioral changes or health problems were apparent as a result of tagging. Both groups continued to grow and spawn, and no mortalities were caused by the procedure. Tags could still be read after two years. Retention rate for striped bass was 97%, while 100% of the red drum retained the tag after 10.5 months."
