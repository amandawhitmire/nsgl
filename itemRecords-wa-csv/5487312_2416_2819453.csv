11,Abstract:,"The aim of the RIDGE (Ridge Inter-​Disciplinary Global Experiments) initiative is to understand the multi-level, complex systems of energy and mass transfer that occur at mid-ocean ridge spreading centers. The RIDGE Theoretical, Experimental, and Analytical Workshop was held with the overall goal of identifying new theoretical approaches and innovative experimental/an​alytical procedures required to support, integrate, and guide seagoing studies. An important overall objective was to encourage the community to consider the importance of developing explicit hypotheses that could be tested by the accumulated spatial and time-series information that will be obtained as a result of the RIDGE program. The ultimate goal, only begun by the workshop, is to develop a science plan describing methods, timetables, and facilities to implement the program of study recommended."
