11,Abstract:,"The spatial distributions of marine biota are frequently patchy. Samples taken from these populations are characterized by values which are mostly small, relative to the population mean, and a few that are very large. It is therefore difficult to estimate stock size using conventional methods. Here, Monte Carlo simulations based on trawl data for Dungeness crab ""Cancer magister"" were performed and compared with the behavior of three estimators of central tendency: sample mean, geometric mean, and a lognormal estimate. Results led to the recommendation of a conservative approach based on comparison of trends found in each of the three estimators. Abundance of aggregated stocks should be indexed with an estimator that has more desirable statistical properties, such as the geometric mean. This may reduce error associated with conventional fisheries stock assessment practices and thus provide for more effective management of overdispersed stocks."
