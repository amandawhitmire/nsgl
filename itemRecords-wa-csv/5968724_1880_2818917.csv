11,Abstract:,"Marine algae live in a dynamic and changing environment in which light, salinity, nutrient and temperature cues may rapidly change. Signal transduction systems allow an organism to perceive such physiological cues and transduce them into a metabolic response. This report provides information on a two component His-Asp signal transduction array encoded in the chromophytic alga ""Heterosigma akashiwo"". Both the sensor kinase and response regulator components of this chloroplast localized signal transduction circuit have been sequenced. Modeling suggests that the response regulator component is of the winged helix-​turn-​helix DNA binding type. Molecular analyses have demonstrated that the ""Heterosigma"" response regulator is constitutively expressed in low abundance during synchronous growth, and that it may bind to DNA, thus serving as a transcriptional regulator."
