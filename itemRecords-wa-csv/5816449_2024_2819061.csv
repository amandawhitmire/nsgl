16,Abstract:,"In this experiment, laboratory-​reared pathogen-free Pacific herring were exposed to pure cultures of ""Ichthyophonus hoferi"", and reproduced the disease seen in naturally infect fish. Wild free-ranging herring captured in northern Puget Sound exhibited ""I. hoferi"" infections soon after metamorphoses, about 4 mo post-hatch. The prevalence increased from 5-6% in 0-yr fish to 24% in 1-yr-old fish to 50-70% in fish over 2 yr old, with no associated increase in mortality. The route of natural transmission to wild herring was not determined, but carnivorous fish became infected and died when they were experimentally fed tissues infected with the organism. ""In vitro"" culture of tissues was the most sensitive method for identifying both clinical and subclinical infections."
