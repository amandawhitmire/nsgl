10,Abstract:,"The following study was conducted at the request of the commercial fishing industry by the Washington Sea Grant Program. The Sea Grant Program is supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. This study was undertaken in order to determine the dollar value of the fishing industry in Whatcom County. Commercial fishing is an important industry to the economy of Washington State, ranking among the top five. The years 1969 and 1970 were chosen for analysis. A questionnaire (survey) was given to each of the nearly 350 resident vessel owners, or operators, 12 fish processors or buyers, and 14 major support industries. A support industry was considered ""major"" if more than 75% of its gross sales were dependent upon the fishing industry."
