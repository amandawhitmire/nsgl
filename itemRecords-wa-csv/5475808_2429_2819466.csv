11,Abstract:,"The goal of this gathering was to formulate a preliminary science plan that defines a ten-year investigative mapping and sampling strategy to achieve the scientific objectives specified in a previous workshop report which develops the rationale for an interdisciplina​ry and integrated research initiative to study the world-​encircling mid-ocean ridge system. Investigators with research interests in biological, chemical, physical, geological and geophysical oceanography were involved, as well as administrative representatives from NSF, ONR, USGS, and NOAA. Along the ridge axis a series of complex, but poorly understood, interactions among chemical, physical and biological processes take place on a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales. The diversity of these processes and the interactions among magmatism, hydrothermal circulation, vent community development, and lithospheric evolution are only defined in a skeletal fashion. The investigative challenge is formidable."
