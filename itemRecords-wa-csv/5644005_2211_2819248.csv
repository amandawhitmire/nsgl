12,Abstract:,"Since the publication of the first edition in September 1988, this directory volunteer monitoring programs has been a valued resource for networking and information sharing. This fourth edition represents a much more ambitious undertaking. Historically, good quantitative data on the nature and extent of volunteer monitoring activities has been scanty or nonexistent. The directory questionnaire and database were specifically designed to yield statistics to fill that gap. The results portray a diverse, widespread, rapidly growing volunteer monitoring movement composed mainly of small grassroots efforts."
