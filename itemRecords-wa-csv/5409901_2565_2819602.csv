9,Abstract:,"Some species of the red algae ""Iridaea"" are harvested as a source of phycocolloid carrageenan, which finds use as a gelling and viscosity regulating agent in many food, industrial and biomedical products. In this study, what is known about the relationship between environmental factors and the distribution, growth and production of selected species of ""Iridaea"" is discussed. Such information is limited to only a few species which are currently harvested from wild populations, or which are prospects for such harvesting, candidates for aquaculture or conspicuous elements of marine communities."
