9,Abstract:,"Modern natural resource management systems are defined by the interplay of natural resources, profit-seeking resource industries, management bureaucracies, and diverse publics. Focusing on the bureaucratic element, this article presents a comparative analysis of the federal management of forests and marine fisheries. Forest policy involves the U.S. Forest Service and occurs in a professional management arena; fishery policy involves the National Marine Fisheries Service and affiliated Regional Fishery Management Councils, and is conducted in a public management arena. The two arenas differ in their organization of power, knowledge, and communication. This model is briefly extended to other natural resource management systems."
