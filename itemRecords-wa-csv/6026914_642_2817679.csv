10,Abstract:,"Research suggests that low-lying coastal communities in the Puget Sound region are vulnerable to local tsunamis and seiches, and that coastal populations in that region are not adequately prepared to respond to a tsunami event. Natural hazard mitigation planning is a relatively new activity in Washington State, and is responsible for designing strategies that reduce tsunami risk and vulnerability in Washington's coastal zone, which includes the shorelines of Puget Sound. The effectiveness of hazard mitigation is dependent upon three primary components - science, public policy, and the mitigation planning process - which are the foundation of tsunami hazard mitigation. This thesis examines these three components by reviewing the best available science and considering the role of science in tsunami hazard mitigation; evaluating existing federal, state, and local policies that influence tsunami hazard mitigation, and reviewing hazard mitigation plans that address tsunamis. This study shows that tsunamis are receiving little attention in hazard mitigation plans, and that the existing policy framework has not been effective in addressing tsunamis in Puget Sound. The findings of this research suggest that the dismissive treatment of the Puget Sound tsunami hazard results from the low salience of tsunamis on state and local political agendas, scientific uncertainty, and inefficiencies in the local planning process."
