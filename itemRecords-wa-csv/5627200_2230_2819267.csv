12,Abstract:,"The viability and early development of 30 diploid and triploid interspecific salmonid hybrids among the Atlantic salmon, brook trout, brown trout, chum salmon, coho salmon and rainbow trout were examined. The goal was to identify useful crosses for hybridization and gynogenesis and general patterns of hybrid viability and development. A statistical design and analysis addressed questions of hybrid viability and protein electrophoresis was used to assess maternal and paternal gene expression in selected hybrids."
