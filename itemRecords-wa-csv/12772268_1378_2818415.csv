9,Abstract:,"Shellfish aquaculture can contribute significantly to satisfying the growing demand worldwide for seafood. Bivalves also play a vital role in cleaning local waters, restoring estuaries, and providing habitat structure. The 2011Washington Shellfish Initiative demonstrated national and state commitment to expanding shellfish aquaculture. But ecologically and socially sustainable expansion requires planning based on human use data, social research, and outreach and education. This project combines geospatial data on commercial aquaculture with research into its social dimensions to support marine spatial planning along the West Coast."
