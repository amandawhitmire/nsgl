12,Abstract:,"All organisms that reduce carbon via the Calvin cycle utilize ribulose-​1,5-​bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) in the primary step of CO2 fixation. In eukaryotes, this enzyme is composed of eight large subunits and eight small subunits. Terrestrial plants and green algae carry the gene encoding the Rubisco small subunit protein in the nucleus and thus must transport the cytoplasmically translated protein into the chloroplast. In contrast, the marine chromophytic alga ""Olisthodiscus luteus"" encodes both large and small protein subunits on chloroplast DNA. To gain insight into the evolutionary and biochemical implications of a chloroplast DNA-encoded small subunit, sequence analysis of the gene was pursued; results are reported here."
