10,Abstract:,"The Dungeness crab is an excellent species for examining recruitment dynamics in estuarine systems because they can be easily identified and collected in the water column, they often exhibit predictable settlement pulses, and settlement and survival in intertidal habitats is easily quantified. Abundance of early juvenile Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") is dramatically higher in intertidal shell habitats compared to mud habitats in several coastal estuaries of the Pacific Northwest. To define the mechanisms underlying this habitat-â€‹specific pattern in abundance, components of recruitment to intertidal shell and mud habitats were examined at two locations within the Grays Harbor estuary (Washington). The results from this study demonstrate that substrate selection can affect distribution of juvenile crab, and that predation (including cannibalism) is a key factor regulating local population size of early juvenile crabs in intertidal habitats where postlarval supply is relatively high."
