9,Abstract:,"This educational factsheet is about a hands-on science camp for middle and high school students on the NOAA Sand Point campus in Seattle, Washington. Since its inception in 2003, NOAA Science Camp has evolved into a highly regarded collaborative science program. More than 10 NOAA offices, Washington Sea Grant and the Joint Institute for Study of the Atmosphere and Oceans (JISAO) partner to introduce middle school and high school students to the multidisciplinaâ€‹ry nature of research. Scientists and educators interact directly with camp participants to demonstrate how NOAA research addresses environmental issues on both local and international scales."
