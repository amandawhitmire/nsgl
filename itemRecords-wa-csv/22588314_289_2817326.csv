12,Abstract:,"Introduction: Overfishing and overcapitalizat​ion have been prominent challenges in the West Coast Groundfish fishery as managers strive to maintain a viable, profitable, and efficient groundfish fishery (Pacific Fishery Management Council and NMFS 2010). The fishery spans the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington and includes about 90 species, many of which are long- lived, slow-growing, and late-to-mature. Management is complicated by multiple species living in the same areas, so that reducing catch limits of one species will indirectly limit catches of another species. Selectively targeting a species is particularly difficult with trawl gear. Taken together, these factors pose challenges to managers who strive to prevent overfishing of all species and reduce excess fishing capacity while maintaining an economically viable fishery.Overfis​hing occurred throughout much of the fishery’s history due to harvest targets that were set too high, further exacerbated by the short data series available for analysis and assessment following the rapid build up in many of these fisheries, relative to life histories of many rockfish (Sebastes spp.) that can live for many decades (Love et al. 1987; Cailliet et al. 2001). At that time, rockfish were thought to be shorter lived and more productive than they are in reality, and as a result, fishing mortality rates were set at unsustainable levels. Assessments in the mid-1990s found that some stocks were below 20% of unfished biomass (Ralston 2011), far below the target levels which were based on spawning potential ratios below 35% (Clark 1991) and then updated to 40% (Clark 1993). Target harvest rates were reduced, and landings declined to the point that the fishery was declared an economic disaster in 2000 (Shaw and Conway 2007; Hilborn et al. 2012). In 2002, the PFMC specified rebuilding plans for overfished species and greatly reduced target fishing mortality rates to as low as 0.8% for Pacific ocean perch (Pacific2 Fishery Management Council 2014). Rebuilding plans have been effective for most species, andseven of ten stocks have been declared rebuilt."
13,,"Abstract: Hook-and-line surveys can be used to estimate trends in the many fish species where more conventional methods such as trawl, acoustic, visual, or pot surveys cannot be applied. Hook-​and-​line surveys allow the collection of biological information including length, weight, age, and sexual maturity, but there are concerns about hook saturation, survey design, and the impact of competition among species on survey abundance estimates. We designed simulations to address these concerns and found hyperstability across all scenarios: catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined more slowly than population size. Despite hyperstability, the surveys still had statistical power to detect changes in abundance. Preferentially selecting sites with the most fish for survey sampling resulted in 45% stronger hyperstability but also a greater ability to detect changes in population size. When fish are distributed patchily, resulting in the most hyperstability,​ a decrease in relative abundance from 50% to 10% resulted in median CPUE values declining 28-35% when sampling preferentially and 11-12% when sampling randomly. Interspecies competition for hooks resulted in biased survey results when one species was more aggressive than another. Taken together, hook-and-line surveys offer a promising technique for species unsuited for other survey types."
