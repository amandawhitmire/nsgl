10,Abstract:,"The divergent life cycles and feeding habits of fish, their consistent growth, and amazing tolerance of long periods of food deprivation are characteristics that keep fishes in a central position in studies of the adaptive evolution of metabolism and its regulatory mechanisms in vertebrates. Pancreatic hormones play the pivotal role in these regulatory mechanisms. New information in this field is accumulating rapidly; this review summarizes the latest trends and findings in studies of the fish endocrine pancreas. Most references to the actions of mammalian pancreatic hormones on fish were omitted because these topics have been repeatedly and adequately discussed in the literature."
