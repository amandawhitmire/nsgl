10,Abstract:,"The Columbia is the fourth largest river in North America and drains an area that includes parts of seven U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. Not long ago, the Columbia River Basin was a wilderness, supporting a population of perhaps 50,000 American Indians, whose world centered on the yearly migrations that brought 10 to 16 million salmon and steelhead back to the river. The Indians who lived in wilderness have given way to a population of 8 million, reflecting a fundamental change in the relationships between people and the environment. The river's uses have been ranked accordingly; power first, then urban and industrial uses, agriculture, flood control, navigation, recreation, and, finally, fish and wildlife. The annual fish runs had declined to 2.5 million by the late 1970s. However, there is hope that a new Columbia may arise, one whose watchword will be ""sustainable"" multiple use. Sustainable development of the Columbia River Basin requires managing an ecosystem the size of France. It will be a place where human and economic objectives are deliberately balanced against natural boundaries and biological rhythms. Taking sustainability seriously is a question of governance. Learning what does not work is a cost of finding ways that will. Minimizing that cost preserves humanity's already limited ability to pursue sustainability with justice and mercy."
