9,Abstract:,"Ocean Acidification (or ‘OA’) is a long-term decrease in seawater pH that is primarily caused by the ocean’s uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) from the atmosphere. CO2 generated by humans’ use of fossil fuels and deforestation has been accumulating in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. About one quarter of this CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, where it reacts with water to form carbonic acid. As a result, the average pH of seawater at the ocean surface has already dropped by ~0.1 units, a 30% increase in acidity. If atmospheric CO2 levels continue to climb at the present rate, ocean acidity will double by the end of this century."
