11,Abstract:,"Here, gravity currents and internal bores are investigated in a horizontal laboratory tank with a lock-exchange device, i.e., by lifting a partition gate that initially separates fresh water from salt water. Using laser-induced fluorescein-dye illumination, qualitative characteristics and behaviors of the flows are examined. In a second set of experiments, gravity currents and internal bores are first generated in a channel of finite breadth to establish its quasi-steady condition. Then, the established current is let off to spread from the end of the channel to open environment. The spreading flow pattern and mixing around the end of the channel is examined and interpreted based on vortex dynamics."
