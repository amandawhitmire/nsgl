11,Abstract:,"The ancestral events that could have initiated the present day spectrum of chloroplast types are the subject of much debate. Although the organization of rRNA genes within an operon is highly conserved in both cyanobacterial and chloroplast DNA, it has been suggested that the global arrangement of this operon on cpDNA may have a significant phylogenetic implication. For example, in all land plants studied to date, the ribosomal operons are localized in the inverted repeat of the chloroplast genome, with a single exception. To date, there are few data that describe chloroplast rDNA operon organization of chl a/PB or chl a/c plants. Information on these algae is critical to the understanding of chloroplast evolution, and offers a more critical phylogenetic assessment in plants that are frequently morphologically and biochemically plastic. In this study, chloroplast rDNA gene organization of the chl a/c alga ""Olisthodiscus luteus"" is analyzed and the nucleotide sequence of the spacer region that separates 16S and 23S rDNA is presented."
