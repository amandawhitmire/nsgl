14,Abstract:,"Several communities bordering Puget Sound are home to industrial and recreational facilities that require access to nearshore and estuarine waters; these areas are periodically dredged to maintain water depth for vessel use. A group was formed to identify and evaluate aquatic sites where dredged materials could be disposed of and managed in Puget Sound. Final site selection was partially based on evaluation of the biological resources found at each of the proposed disposal sites. This paper gives a general overview of the trawl studies conducted to assess bottom fish resources at, and adjacent to, each proposed disposal site, and implications for long-term monitoring."
