9,Abstract:,"Seafoods are at their peak of quality the moment they are harvested. Shortly after their death, however, the natural process of decomposition begins; and even when seafoods are stored under ideal conditions, their quality will deteriorate overtime. This publication describes spoilage patterns and includes a table which details the typical stages of fresh fish spoilage. The shelf-life of seafood can be measurably increased by observing several basic rules, described in the publication."
