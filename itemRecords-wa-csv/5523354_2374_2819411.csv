12,Abstract:,"Estuaries serve a critical role in the early life history of many fish and shellfish, and it appears that rather complex behavioral mechanisms have evolved to enable larvae to locate estuarine areas. Two commercially important species (Dungeness crab, ""Cancer magister,"" and English sole, ""Paraphrys vetulus"") rely extensively on estuaries as juveniles. All English sole and most of the crab caught by commercial fishermen are harvested in coastal waters, however. Adult reproduction occurs almost exclusively in coastal areas, and the early larvae of both species are pelagic, but later in their development they move to the benthos in both coastal and estuarine areas, and assume a demersal existence for the remainder of their lives. This paper reports on patterns of use by both species, after analysis of extensive trawl surveys."
