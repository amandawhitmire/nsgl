11,Abstract:,"Sailing or cruising in your boat should be an enjoyable and exhilarating experience. But, are you ready for the day when something goes really wrong? You may find yourself having to survive in cold and stormy conditions for an extended period, while you wait for help. You need to have the proper survival equipment, and know how to use it. ""Water Wise"" presents the information skippers and crew need to know in a readable, well-â€‹illustrated way. It covers trip preparation, weather, illness, in-water survival, signaling, search and rescue, fire-fighting, safety rules, and more. There are also a list of resources and contacts, a glossary, and an index. Much in this book is of use to campers and beachgoers as well."
