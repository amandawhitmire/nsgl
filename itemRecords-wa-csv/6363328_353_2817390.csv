11,Abstract:,"Over the last twenty years various studies have been published examining local grassroots environmental movements (LGEM). In 1998, Paul Almeida and Linda Brewster Stearns focused their study of mercury disease victims in Minamata, Japan, to the larger political context in which LGEMs struggle, using a political opportunity framework. They found that the success of the Minamata LGEM hinged on its ability to employ non-traditional and institutionally disruptive tactics during a period of expanded political opportunities (Alemeida and Stearns, 1998). This study utilizes this framework to examine the Maury Island LGEM. Located on a small, rural island in Washington State's Puget Sound, the Maury Island LGEM developed to directly oppose the expansion of a sand and gravel mine to industrial proportions. Over the course of the thirteen-year dispute, the LGEM raised many environmental and public health concerns. The dispute was fought using a variety of tactics including litigation, lobbying, protests and demonstrations. The evolution of these tactics and the success of the LGEM over time is analyzed in this paper. Results show similarities to the Minamata case, including the benefit of exercising a variety of tactics during a period of expanded political opportunity. In addition, the Maury Island LGEM found success after a regional movement to restore Puget Sound had been created, setting up conflict and contradiction for regulatory agencies."
