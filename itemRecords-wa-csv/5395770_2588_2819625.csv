11,Abstract:,"An `in vitro' assay was developed to evaluate specific binding of triiodothyronin​e (T3) by nuclei isolated from red blood cells (RBCs) of rainbow trout (""Salmo gairdneri""). Furthermore, to make more detailed evolutionary comparisons of thyroid hormone (TH) receptor characteristics​, the relative binding activities of several TH analogs in the assay were investigated. Finally, to examine the relationship between nuclear TH binding and erythropoiesis, the effects of stimulating erythropoiesis by bleeding on the binding of T3 by trout RBC nuclei were investigated."
