9,Abstract:,"In 1993, the nine separate towns of Washington County established a county Regional Planning Council in recognition that the region's rural character could be transformed into a ""sprawling, generic suburb"" if intervening steps were not taken. The Council's vision statement, generated after many workshops and interviews was originally published as an insert to the Providence Journal in order to prompt discussion and involve people at all levels in the completion of a vision still evolving. Sections are devoted to clean water, land use, economic development, housing, and transportation."
