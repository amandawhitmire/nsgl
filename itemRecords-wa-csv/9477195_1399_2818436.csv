13,Abstract:,"This report offers planners and decision makers an overview of the existing literature on the valuation of ecosystem services provided by shellfish restoration and enhancement and by shellfish management (i.e., the sustainable use of natural shellfish beds).1 In order to orient non-economists to economic valuation, the review also describes the economic concepts and methods that have been applied in this literature."
