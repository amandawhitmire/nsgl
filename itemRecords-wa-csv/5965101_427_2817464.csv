12,Abstract:,"Because ballast water is implicated in initiating many nonnative species invasions all over the world, researchers have been working to develop ways to combat this problem. This article describes recent work investigating the use of ozone to destroy bacteria, phytoplankton, and zooplankton in ballast water. When oxygen-rich air is sent through an electrode and exposed to 10,000 volts of electricity, ozone emerges and is conveyed to the ballast water. The article discusses efficacy of the treatment, the trade-offs surrounding one of the byproducts (bromine), and considerations for the shipping industry."
