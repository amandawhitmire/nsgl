9,Abstract:,"This bulletin reports on recent accomplishments of PRISM (Puget sound Regional Integrated Synthesis Model) which has created an education program linking interdisciplinaâ€‹ry earth systems and social sciences at the undergraduate and graduate levels at the University of Washington. The issue includes articles about new courses at the University, the development of new models, a program educating middle school students about sewage outfall in Puget Sound, a 10- week course about salmonid issues in the Sound that reached Washington residents outside of the UW student community, and a lecture series on human impacts on the Puget Sound region."
