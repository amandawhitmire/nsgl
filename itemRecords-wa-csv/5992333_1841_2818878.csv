13,Abstract:,"The authors present the application of long-range surface plasmons to a wavelength-â€‹modulated surface plasmon resonance sensor. Theoretical design parameters and experimental data are presented for two sensor designs, using either magnesium fluoride or Teflon AF-1600 as a dielectric buffer layer. The demonstrated sensitivity of the long-range surface plasmon resonance sensor in refractometric experiments is up to seven times higher than that of an equivalent conventional surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor, while the measured resolution is comparable. According to theoretical design calculations presented, further optimization of materials and layer thickness could reduce the resonance width while achieving even higher sensitivities, thereby creating a sensor with significantly better resolution than conventional SPR sensors."
