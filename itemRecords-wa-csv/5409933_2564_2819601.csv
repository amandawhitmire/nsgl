9,Abstract:,"Induced triploidy may provide an effective tool to uncouple the related phenomena of reproductive effort, productivity, and growth. Triploids could be used to estimate energy available for somatic growth or maintenance during periods when only combined somatic and reproductive effort can be estimated in diploids. Reported here are the results of 1 yr of field data from triploid ""Crassostrea gigas"" Thunberg with regard to growth, survival, glycogen content, and sexual maturity. Triploids are remarkably different from diploid sibling in all of these aspects. The clear implication of these data is that the physiology of triploids is profoundly affected by reduced sexual maturation."
