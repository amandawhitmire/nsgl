13,Abstract:,"All known calcium-​regulated photoproteins contain three Ca2+-binding sites of the EF-hand type. In this study of obelin luminescence, researchers examined whether the calcium ions function as an indispensable reagent or purely in a regulatory role. To do this they determined the influence on luminescence of disabling the Ca2+-binding sites, individually and in combination. Results indicate that all three sites are critically involved in the control of photoprotein luminescence, and give some insights into their interaction."
