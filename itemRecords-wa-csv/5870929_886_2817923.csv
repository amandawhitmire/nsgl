10,Abstract:,"A soft-shelled non-indigenous clam, ""Nuttallia obscurata,"" has invaded coastal soft-sediment habitats of the northeastern Pacific. In a survey of 35 sites within the San Juan Islands, Washington, ""Nuttallia"" was found almost exclusively in sandy substrates, higher in the intertidal than most native clams. The distinctive distribution of ""Nuttallia"" suggested that tidal height and sediment composition may be important physical factors that control its refuge availability, regulating its exposure to predation and ultimately the success of its invasion. This paper reports on experiments conducted to test that hypothesis."
