13,Abstract:,"This paper addresses the feasibility of underwater wireless video transmission using an acoustic system, which consists of a video compressor/deco​mpressor and an OFDM modulator/demod​ulator. This work includes two main parts: the design of an algorithm aimed to compensate for the Doppler effect and the assessment of a set of error resilience tools offered by the MPEG-4 standard. The results of the simulations and in-air experiments demonstrate the performance improvement in terms of visual quality of the received video in cases with motion, as well as the system robustness against channel induced errors."
