10,Abstract:,"Foraminifera, or forams, are marine microbiota that are found in marine environments all over the world. Forams construct their shells(tests) out of calcium carbonate (calcareous) or sediment particles (agglutinated). The forams found here in Puget Sound are all benthic, living in the sediment on the sea floor.This project focused on the foram assemblages from sediment samples collected in Dyes and Sinclair Inlets, Puget Sound. These inlets surround the city of Bremerton, Washington, and are home to U.S.Naval Base Kitsap. Several sites in these inlets have been designated as federal Super Fund sites. By tracking the diversity, abundance, and shell condition of the foraminifera, we hope to discover if environmental hazards are causing harm to Puget Soundâ€™s health."
