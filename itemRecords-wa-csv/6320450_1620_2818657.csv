13,Abstract:,"Progressive increases in storm intensities and generated wave heights along the U.S. West Coast are likely controlled by changes in the Earth's climate as is the expected acceleration of global sea-levelrise. As climate change-related processes continue to enhance coastal hazards (e.g., erosion and flooding), communities in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) need to know where and how to respond to best protect lives, livelihoods, infrastructure, and resources. Vulnerability to climate change-enhanced hazards is not simply a matter of characterizing threatening physical processes but also involves assessing the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of human-​environmental systems that influence the potential for future impacts. The threats posed by climate change to PNW coastal communities can be more accurately communicated by integrating improved hazard models that incorporate climate-change controls with information on the vulnerability of communities to these hazards. To examine the influence of climate-change on community vulnerability to coastal hazards, we assessed variations in current and future societal vulnerability in Tillamook (Oregon) and Pacific (Washington) Counties. Model predictions of natural hazards under various climate-change scenarios are combined with current and projected socioeconomic indices using geographic-​information-​system (GIS) tools. Results suggest variations in exposure and sensitivity to hazards relate to city size? larger communities may experience great losses to future coastal hazards that reflect only a small portion of their community while smaller communities may experience relatively smaller losses that devastate them. Community vulnerability information can be used to further develop local land-use, hazard-​mitigation, and emergency-​management plans to incorporate risks posed by climate change-induced hazards."
