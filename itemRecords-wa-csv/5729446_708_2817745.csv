13,Abstract:,"At present, three terrestrial means of identifying and dating past earthquakes are available: (1) paleosols and buried trees in growth position, (2) sand intrusions, and (3) tsunami-​deposited sand. A new approach to detect Holocene subduction-zone earthquakes combines the results from ground-​penetrating radar (GPR), Vibracores, and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dates from a barrier spit located west of Willapa Bay, southwest Washington."
