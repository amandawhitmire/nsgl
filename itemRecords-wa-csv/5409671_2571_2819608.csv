9,Abstract:,"Conchospores from the perennial conchocelis phase of the annual, epiphytic, marine red alga ""Porphyra nereocystis"", which in nature lives on the large annual kelp ""Nereocystis luetkeana"", are released in culture only in response to a short-day photoperiod treatment followed by a long-day treatment. Each treatment requires a minimum of three to four weeks and is enhanced by lower temperature during the second photoperiod treatment. To our knowledge ""P. nereocystis"" is the first known dual-daylength seaweed and requires a short-​day-​long-​day treatment for completion of its life cycle. This stringent environmental control of its reproduction appears to be an adaptation to coordinate conchospore production with the seasonal availability of its host kelp ""Nereocystis""."
