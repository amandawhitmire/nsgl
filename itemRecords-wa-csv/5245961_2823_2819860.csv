13,Abstract:,"Before stating the broad purpose of this workshop on ocean resources economics, I would like to provide a context by describing the mission of its sponsor, the Office of Ocean Resources Coordination and Assessment (ORCA) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Within NOAA we are responsible for identifying and evaluating the impacts of alternative resource uses in intensely used coastal and ocean regions. We develop and recommend management strategies or policies for the use of resources of these regions which will result in maximum benefit to the Nation. We have the responsibility for development of NOAA-wide policy positions in two important areas: (1) outer continental shelf oil and gas exploration and development; and (2) marine transportation. To improve our ability to carry out this mission, ORCA sponsors projects to develop and apply new methods for projecting and evaluating both the short-term and long-term environmental and economic impacts of coastal and ocean resource use decisions. We have initiated a series of five regional strategic assessments of the entire U.S. coastal and 200-mile fishery conservation zone to identify significant resource use conflicts before they occur. We also give technical assistance to states and other federal agencies on a wide variety of coastal and ocean resource issues, ranging from special area management to evaluating the onshore impacts of marine mineral mining. We administer the Office of Coastal Zone Management's responsibilitie​s for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act with respect to both state coastal zone management programs and proposed marine and estuarine sanctuaries. We are one of the few--perhaps the only--federal offices attempting to develop in a strategic manner the necessary data base and methods for analyzing national policy on programs for coastal and ocean resource use on a comprehensive scale and within an explicit analytical framework. The purpose of this workshop is to serve as one departure point for a modest program of economic and institutional research related to the management of ocean resources that will be undertaken by ORCA later this year. The oceans represent a set of resources for which, in fact, very little management currently exists. An important objective of this program will be the development and use of data with which to consider explicitly the benefits and costs to the nation and its coastal regions of alternative ocean resource uses. Since ORCA is concerned with the multiple use of ocean resources, the problem of identifying and evaluating the costs and benefits of conflicts and compatibilities among these uses is of greatest importance to us."
