11,Abstract:,"This paper describes the diet composition and feeding relationships of juvenile coho, chinook, chum, and sockeye salmon collected from coastal waters off Washington and Oregon during a series of summer purse-seine collections made from 1980 to 1985. Oceanographic conditions and biological productivity were highly variable during this period, both seasonally and interannually, and thus provided a fortuitous situation in which to examine the effects of environmental variability on juvenile salmon feeding habits. In addition to the interannual variation in feeding, the broad seasonal and geographic coverage of the sampling permitted more detailed intra-annual and areal resolution than was previously possible."
