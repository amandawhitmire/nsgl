10,Abstract:,"Commercial fishermen, along with other mariners, today are faced with a serious problem--waste disposal. Plastics, boat garbage, oil, sewage, and hazardous materials can severely damage the marine environment. For this reason, recent legislation has been enacted to prohibit their disposal into marine waters. This pamphlet discusses plastic marine debris and other wastes--where they come from, what adverse impacts they can have, and how the problem can be reduced."
