10,Abstract:,"We used both mass balance and dynamics ecosystem models to represent historic, current and potential future ecosystem conditions in South Puget Sound. The forecast model examines the potential effects of different fisheries and aquaculture management policies on managed species in the South Puget Sound Ecosystem over the next 40 years. Our forecasts of future conditions involve simulating three potential future marine productivity regimes: - greater and more variable than that from 1970 to the present, - similar to that from 1970 to the present, - lower but with similar variability to that from 1970 to the present. In order to simulate likely marine production in the future we developed an Ecosim model of South Puget Sound from 1970 to the present in which we used time series of biomass, mortality and/or catches for managed shellfish, finfish, bird and marine mammal to estimate trophic dynamics and annual mean phytoplankton production. The historically estimated bottom-up and top-down dynamics were then used to initialise Ecosim forecast models from the present to 2054 driven by phytoplankton production time series reflective of the three potential marine production regimes. The mass balance models of South Puget Sound in 1970 and 2012 catalogue the changes that have occurred in the biomass of several marine species of biological, cultural and economic significance. Analyses of the mass balance models suggest that the rapid expansion of shellfish aquaculture would not likely have significantly influenced the biomasses of other species. The dynamic historic model reinforces the hypothesis that shellfish aquaculture had significant room to grow between 1970 and 2012 without interfering with the energetic dynamics of wild species in South Puget Sound. Forecast models show that in all scenarios of future marine production there are few, if any, effects on the South Puget Sound ecosystem from maintaining or doubling the production shellfish aquaculture production. In a scenario in which farmed Geoduck production was increased 10 times over that of 2012 small decreases in wild bivalves were observed by 2054. Forecast modelling also suggests that current fisheries and aquaculture policies generally have the effect of allowing for rebuilding biomasses in species that had declined from 1970 to the present. Sea lions appeared to attenuate the rebuilding of biomasses of some finfish in forecasts to 2054. However scenarios modelled with mandated reduction in Sea Lion biomasses showed significant rebuilding of rockfish, salmon and gadids."
