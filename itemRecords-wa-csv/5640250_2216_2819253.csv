13,Abstract:,"The potato (""Solanum tuberosum"") is of the most important food crops in the world. Considerable effort has been invested in increasing disease resistance of potato cultivars through selective breeding and, more recently, via genetic engineering. New technologies, such as ""Agrobacterium""-â€‹mediated transformation, make possible the transfer of individual resistance traits into commercially desirable cultivars. The coding sequence from the pea disease resistance reponse gene 49 (DRR49 gene), was transferred into the potato (cultivar Shepody) via ""Agrobacterium"" co-cultivation. Field pathogenicity tests indicated that transgenic plants expressing the pea DRR49 mRNA have higher tuber yields than the control plants when grown in PED (potato early dying) infested soil."
