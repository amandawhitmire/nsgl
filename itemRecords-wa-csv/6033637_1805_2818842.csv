12,Abstract:,"The catch, discard, and associated mortality of bycatch species has been identified as a problem of great and increasing national concern (Saila, 1983; NOAA, 1991). As is clear from the proceedings of this conference, bycatch problems take many forms, varying among regions, and among fisheries within each region. Thus the ""bycatch problem"" is actually a complex suite of problems, and solutions are likely to come from a variety of directions. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the potential for gear technology to provide solutions to bycatch problems. Given the diverse nature of bycatch problems, I have chosen to address this objective by focusing on the process by which gear solutions may be obtained, rather than concentrating on specific technological solutions. Thus, this paper presents an overview of what I consider to be the key elements of a research program that is likely to succeed in providing viable gear technology solutions to bycatch problems. I also illustrate the general points made with a specific example with which I am quite familiar - namely the West Coast Groundfish Mesh Size Study. Again, in describing this example, I have focused on the process by which the study was conducted, rather than on the specific results."
