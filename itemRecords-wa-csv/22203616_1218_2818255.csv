15,Abstract:,"People love to live, work, and play in places where water and land meet. Shorelines provide work, recreation, living space, mild climates, and wonderful views. People are not the only ones drawn to biologically rich and productive places. Unfortunately, many of the natural features that make shorelines so attractive are often the casualties of human activities. Native trees, shrubs, and grasses are cleared to make way for houses, lawns, and views. Bulkheads, docks, and piers displace beaches and alter natural shoreline processes. Loss of shoreline vegetation allows contaminants to flow directly into the water. Prime wildlife habitats disappear, taking with them birds, mammals, fish, and beneficial insects. The good news is that people are finding new strategies for protecting waterfront properties while also protecting and restoring habitats. Instead of concrete and sheetpile, these practices use a combination of plantings, gravel and sand, logs, stones, setbacks, and slope modification to protect against shoreline erosion and provide access while respecting the ecological attributes of the shoreline (adapted from Green Shorelines, City of Seattle, 2011). The Green Shores program described in this chapter is one of many initiatives in the Salish Sea region with the broad objective of increasing our capacity to address impacts of shoreline development and climate change on coastal ecology and human well-being."
