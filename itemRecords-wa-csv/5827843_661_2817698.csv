11,Abstract:,"""Mya arenaria,"" the soft-shell clam, provides the earliest documented case of a consequential introduction of an exotic marine organism by humans. During the 13th century, soft-shell clams were apparently carried by Viking seamen from the northwestern Atlantic to Denmark, from where they are thought to have spread along European coasts. In subsequent centuries, this species spread over extensive geographic regions, most often through deliberate or accidental introductions. Juveniles originating in the east coast of the United States were translocated to San Francisco Bay sometime between 1869 and 1974. By the early 1880s, it was so appreciated that a series of intentional northward plantings contributed to its dispersion along the Pacific coast and into Willapa Bay (Washington), from where it spread to neighboring Grays Harbor. Here the authors reconstruct the fate of the introduction of ""Mya arenaria"" in Grays Harbor, and its apparent ecological effects in this well-studied estuarine ecosystem."
