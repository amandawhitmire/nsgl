13,Abstract:,"Attempts to control burrowing shrimp in areas of aquaculture have occurred since the early 1900s following reported expansions of shrimp populations where oysters were formerly dominant. Carbaryl, a non- persistent organocarbamate pesticide that is extremely toxic to arthropods, was selected for burrowing shrimp control based on its efficacy, rapid hydrolysis, and low mammalian toxicity and has been used in Washington State's coastal estuaries since 1963. Since its inception, the carbaryl program has been a focal point of contention among diverse economic, recreational, and environmental interests in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor due to its toxicity to non-target species, including juvenile Dungeness crabs and benthic invertebrates that form an integral part of estuarine food webs. This paper reviews issues pertaining to oyster culture, the use of carbaryl to control burrowing shrimp populations, and effects on non-target species, as well as what is known of burrowing shrimp life history and ecology. The importance of integrating information on shrimp, such as timing of recruitment, variability in year class strength, and patterns of habitat use, into carbaryl control policies or alternative strategies are emphasized."
