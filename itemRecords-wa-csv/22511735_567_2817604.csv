13,Abstract:,"Seven years have passed since Floating Breakwater Conference I was held at the University of Rhode Island. In the intervening span of time, the interest in, and demand for, floating breakwaters have increased, many structures have been built, advances have been made in fabrication techniques and in the analysis of both hydraulic and structural responses, some field experiences have been documented, some new ideas have been advanced, and some improvements have been made in the prediction of a design wave from wind and fetch data. It is these issues that Floating Breakwater Conference II will address, with attention given to current problems and to the identification of research needs of both the applied and theoretical nature."
