13,Abstract:,"Members of the dinoflagellate genus ""Protogonyaulax​"" produce toxins that are responsible for the world-wide occurrences of PSP in humans and marine mammals. ""Protogonyaulax​"" species produce an array of chemically similar neurotoxins that differ in their biological toxicity. In this study, PSP toxin concentrations were measured and individual toxin profiles were monitored in axenic batch cultures of ""P. tamarensis"" and ""P. catenella"". High pressure liquid chromatographic methods were used that allowed the separation of all 12 known paralytic shellfish poisons from a single sample. Data suggest that the toxin profile in isolates of ""Protogonyaulax​"" can change, sometimes significantly, with changing environmental variables."
