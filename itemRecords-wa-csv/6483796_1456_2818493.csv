9,Abstract:,"Understanding the significance of adaptive genetic variation underlying phenotypic characters is important for determining population fitness and persistence. In salmonids, growth-related traits have been shown to be related to a number of key life history traits that are important for fitness. Here, a combination of quantitative and molecular approaches were used to characterize quantitative traits involved in growth in coho salmon populations, and to examine whether adaptive processes underlying these traits have played a role in their evolution. Population divergence at quantitative traits (QST) was compared to that at neutral markers, (FST); QST values for juvenile traits exceeded FST, suggesting that selection may have driven population divergence at these traits. As a first step in identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL), sex-specific genome maps were constructed. A total of 133 microsatellite markers, 148 amplified fragment length polymorphisms and one phenotypic locus were used to detect twenty-four linkage groups spanning 287.4 cM in the male and 33 linkage groups spanning 429.7cM in the female. Fifty-three QTL for growth rate, length and weight at eight time periods were located on seven linkage groups and five QTL for growth related traits and one QTL for hatch timing were associated with six unlinked markers. Multiple QTL mapped to the same linkage group location, indicating a genetic basis for phenotypic correlations observed between many of the traits. Population genomic surveys of divergence in four wild coho populations were used in order to detect ""outlier"" loci that show evidence of adaptive divergence. Four loci linked to QTL for growth-related traits and seven anonymous loci were found to be under selection in one or more pairwise comparisons. Balancing selection tended to outweigh directional selection at the loci surveyed, although the power of the approach might have been limited by recombination between the marker and the trait locus, by time since population divergence, or by historic population sizes. This research provides new genomic tools for coho salmon, describes the molecular basis of growth-related traits in coho salmon and contributes to a deeper understanding of functional genetic differences between populations of coho salmon."
