10,Abstract:,"Nongeniculate, encrusting coralline algae are often the only macroalgae capable of surviving the intense herbivory common throughout shallow rocky regions of the North Atlantic. Although the exact origin of current coralline-â€‹herbivore species associations in the North Atlantic is unknown, a possible key to understanding factors responsible in shaping their evolution is to identify some of the adaptations that allow species of these groups to coexist. This paper examines convergent aspects of morphology and anatomy evident among species in the coralline floras of the Boreal eastern North Pacific (Washington State) and the Subarctic western North Atlantic (Gulf of Maine) relative to the specific grazing pressures they receive."
