10,Abstract:,"The National Sea Grant College Program is well-suited to serve as a partner in marine plastic debris education and problem-â€‹solving. Sea Grant has demonstrated its ability to nurture innovative educational efforts at the local level. Its existing national network provides a means for locally-based efforts to grow and reach even larger audiences. This article discusses some of the ways and means, both proposed and in place, of educating the public about the problems of marine plastic pollution and methods of addressing them."
