10,Abstract:,"The rapidity and precise timing of senescence and death of Pacific salmon is an often cited example for a functional role of aging and death. The death of Pacific salmon after a single reproductive event is an example of a semelparous mode of reproduction. Animals that produce multiple offspring or litters over an extended reproductive life-span are classified as iteroparous. Clearly, the rapid aging and senescence of Pacific salmon is an example of a genetically programmed death. As such, Pacific salmon and other semelparous fish are useful for investigation of the mechanisms of aging and death. This review addresses some of those mechanisms in salmon and lamprey and points out promising areas for future research."
