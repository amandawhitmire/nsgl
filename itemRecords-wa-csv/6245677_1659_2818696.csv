10,Abstract:,"One facet of a collaborative Chesapeake Bay Atlantic sturgeon restoration program involves studies related to sturgeon nutrition and feeding management practices. Feed training of wild-caught fish is being evaluated to develop feeding protocols in support of establishing a captive broodstock population. Other studies are evaluating fatty acid enrichment of live larval foods and pre-release weaning assessment, to advance the technologies applicable to future replenishment research. A summary of findings and implications for future research will be summarized."
