11,,"""Echinocephalus overstreeti"" sp. n. infects the stingray, ""Taeniura melanopilos"", from the Marquesas Islands. It differs from all known species of ""Echinocephalus​"" by possessing three preanal, one adanal, and three postanal pairs or papillae. ""E. overstreeti"" is most similar to ""E. sinensis""; when re-examined, the holotype of ""E. sinensis"" was found to possess three, rather than two, pairs of preanal papillae and modified annules on the ventral surface of posterior extremity. SEM photomicrograph​s of both species are included."
