10,Abstract:,"Coastal zones worldwide are under pressure from population growth, resource degradation and conflict. Increasing settlement of coastal margins is expanding the intensity and variety of human uses of coastal resources. The number of nonhuman claimants to coastal resources is also growing as protection of fur animal, marine bird and marine mammal populations is implemented. Problems facing coastal zones extend inland to watersheds through the important connection of estuaries. These coastal, estuarine and watershed problems are institutional, with biophysical and economic symptoms. This paper illustrates the role of historical paths and problems of redirection in institutions for coastal zone management. The focus is on salmon in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, which are both an integrating and polarizing presence throughout coastal zones and watersheds. Anadromous salmon traverse both watersheds and coastal zones in the course of their life histories as they migrate from rivers to oceans, and then back to freshwater natal streams to spawn. In ecological terms, they serve as the integrators of riverine and coastal ecosystems. The Columbia River Basin and the coastal ocean of Oregon and Washington provide excellent examples of the importance of historical development paths, the expanding connectivity between coastal zones and watershed, the increasing number of interests, and the contradiction between the present institutional environment and that needed to achieve coastal zone sustainability."
