13,Abstract:,"A large, intact sulfide chimney, designated Finn, was recovered from the Mothra Vent Field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge in 1998. Finn was venting 302 degrees C fluids on the seafloor and contained complex mineralogical zones surrounding a large open central conduit. Examination of microorganisms within these zones, followed by community analysis with oligonucleotide probes, showed that there were variations in the abundance and diversity of eubacteria and archaea from the exterior to the interior of the chimney. Communities composed primarily of ""Crenarcheota"" inhabited high-​temperature interior regions of the chimney structure. The data are discussed in terms of microenvironmen​ts present within the chimney structure, which may select for and sustain different physiological and metabolic groups of microorganisms."
