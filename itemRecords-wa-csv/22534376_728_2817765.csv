8,Abstract:,"Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor are known for their ecological integrity, habitat values and water quality despite historic alterations to the bays and their watersheds. These areas are tremendously important to the conservation of fish, shorebirds and other wildlife, and they are economically important to fisheries, shellfish aquaculture and as transportation waterways. Like other estuaries on the West Coast, they are complex and dynamic ecosystems affected by variability and trends in ocean conditions and climate."
