9,Abstract:,"After 20 years of legal challenges and nearly 5 years of negotiation, the states of Oregon and Washington, the Nez Perce, Umatilla, Warm Springs, and Yakima tribes, and the U.S. Departments of Commerce and Interior have reached an agreement on Columbia River fisheries management. This is an historic plan outlining how salmon and steelhead runs will be rebuilt and shared among Indians and non-Indians. Work on this new plan has been underway since 1983 when a U.S. District Court Judge ordered development of a joint management agreement. At the core of this new agreement is the goal `to rebuild weak runs to full productivity and fairly share the harvest of upper river runs.' A blueprint that will shape the region's fisheries for years to come, it provides the critical link needed in developing a coordinated, regional effort to restore Columbia River salmon and steelhead runs. The major points of the plan are summarized here."
