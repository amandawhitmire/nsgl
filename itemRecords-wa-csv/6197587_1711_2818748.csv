10,Abstract:,"Although the latitudinal diversity gradient, where species diversity peaks at low latitudes, is well documented, much less is known about how species life history strategies differ among regions and the implications of these differences for community development trajectories and particularly for invasion dynamics. As a first step in trying to understand these factors, we contrast spatial and temporal variation in recruitment rates and resultant community development of epifaunal assemblages in regions along a latitudinal gradient from the temperate zone to the tropics. We exposed settlement panels in four regions: Long Island Sound (Connecticut), Chesapeake Bay and Virginia's Eastern Shore (Maryland and Virginia), Indian River Lagoon (Florida), and a portion of the Mesoamerican reef in Belize. Panels were deployed for either one to two weeks, to evaluate recruitment patterns, or one year, to monitor community development. We found that both recruitment and community development rates were inversely correlated with diversity, with the highest rates seen in temperate latitudes and the lowest in tropical Belize. Seasonal variability in recruitment also varied latitudinally, with strong summer pulses of recruitment in northern latitudes shifting to low and year-round recruitment at low latitudes. However, species turnover through time in communities becoming established was highest in Belize. We conclude with predictions regarding the implications these patterns may have on invasion dynamics at different latitudes."
