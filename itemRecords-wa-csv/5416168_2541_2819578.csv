12,Abstract:,"Techniques for the control of sex differentiation have been used successfully in several fish species. In salmonids the ability to produce totally female populations could potentially increase the number of eggs available for salmon broodstock programs and eliminate the incidence of precocious sexual maturation of genotypic males. Objectives in this study were to evaluate various doses of estradiol and diethylstilbest​erol in producing monosex female populations in Atlantic salmon, to determine if these changes were irreversible, and to determine the effects of these steroids on the fish's survival."
