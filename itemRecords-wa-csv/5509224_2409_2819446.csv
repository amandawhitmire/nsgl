9,Abstract:,"This volume contains the proceedings of a one-day seminar on Lake Erie with emphasis on its nearshore and coastal wetland areas. The volume opens with the geological and physical nature of Lake Erie and its coastal regions. Succeeding papers summarize the chemistry and biology of the nearshore and coastal areas, both within the historical context and the context of present conditions of pollution and physical modification. Of great importance to the future condition of the Lake Erie ecosystem, the views and policies of government throughout the local, state, and national hierarchy are succinctly covered as well. The folowing papers are included in this publication: 1. Overview of Lake Erie and its estuaries within the Great Lakes ecosystem. Charles E. Herdendorff and Kenneth A. Krieger pp. 1-34. 2. Paleogeology and geomorphology. Charles E. Herdendorff pp. 35-70. 3. The effect of Lake Erie on its tributaries-​-​resulting tributary transport mechanisms and contrasts with marine estuaries. Keith W. Bedford pp. 71-123 4. Remote sensing of suspended sediments and wetlands in western Lake Erie. John G. Lyon pp. 125-147. 5. Chemical limnology and contaminants. Kenneth A. Krieger pp. 149-175. 6. Plankton and macroinvertebra​tes. David M. Klarer pp. 177-189. 7. The growth dynamics and ecology of the major littoral algae of Lake Erie. Mark E. Monaco and Richard C.
