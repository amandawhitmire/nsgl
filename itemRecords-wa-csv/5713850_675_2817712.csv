9,Abstract:,"Concepts and techniques for teaching oceanography and marine science were taught to twenty elementary and middle school teachers from Washington, Oregon, and California in July, 1994. Using the tools of oceanographers and marine scientists, and meeting with scientists, resource managers, and industry representatives provided intensive, hands-on instruction. Introduction to concepts was followed by classroom activities which could be used at a more elementary level. Participants developed teaching modules in marine geology, physical oceanography, pollution, marine habitats, marine resources, and deep ocean science."
