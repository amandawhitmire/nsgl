9,Abstract:,"Not only humans experience the deleterious effects of plastic and other debris found along our shorelines and in our waters. Fish, whales, porpoises, turtles, and seabirds may mistake plastic and other items for food. Plastic bags, styrofoam, bottle caps, etc. can cause death through blocked passages, ulcerations, toxic accumulations, and starvation. Beach surveys even in remote areas of the Antarctic have indicated that debris is washing up on shore in great quantities and is not decomposing, particularly if it is plastic. A recent survey of Washington beaches showed that nearly 56% of the debris was plastic; next came metal items at nearly 19% and paper at 12% with the remainder miscellaneous materials. This fact sheet offers tips on what ordinary citizens can do to help keep our shorelines clean."
