13,Abstract:,"In Washington state, shellfish aquaculture is an important piece of our heritage and culture, contributing $270 million to the annual economy and 2,700 local jobs, not to mention unparalleled protein for markets near and far. Shellfish also provide important ecosystem services, filtering water to improve water quality and providing structure for marine organisms."
