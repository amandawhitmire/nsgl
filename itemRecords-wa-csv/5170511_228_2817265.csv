10,Abstract:,"This paper will describe the vessel traffic systems in operation in Vancouver, British Columbia; Seattle, Washington; and San Francisco, California. Attention will be given to the geographic peculiarities of the locale of each system, as well as to the nature of the vessel traffic in the respective areas' A general outline of the administration of the systems, their day-to-day procedures, and the equipment they utilize will be attempted. Where appropriate, reference will be made to second-​generation systems and to the perceptions and attitudes of the direct users of the systems, (i.e., in the maritime industry). No effort was made in this study to contact or interview other interested parties such as pleasure boat owners, marine sportspersons or conservationist​s. Each system study concludes with a brief analysis and recommendations concerning the physical implementation ​ of the system. A general section at the end deals with the legal implications of recent federal legislation; coast guard regulations; the rights and liabilities of the system operators, system participants and equipment suppliers; modeling research; and possible international and intranational jurisdictional problems. The specific problem of pre-emption of state legislation and regulations by federal law is only discussed in passing in this paper."
