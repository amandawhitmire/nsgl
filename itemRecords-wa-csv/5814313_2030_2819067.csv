16,Abstract:,"The system described in this paper provides a simple and rapid approach for the fabrication of highly specific, durable, portable and low cost surface plasmon resonance- based biosensors. Recognition elements were attached to the surfaces of miniature integrated sensors using a gold- binding repeating polypeptide. The coupling of protein A to the polypeptide on the sensor surface enabled the biosensor to detect the binding of antibodies to the protein A and provided a sensor with convertible specificity."
