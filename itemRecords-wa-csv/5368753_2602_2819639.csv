10,Abstract:,"If salmon and trout farms could optimize feed conversion, there could be a 20-28% decrease in their commercial feed costs. Studies indicate the most reliable means to achieve this (and other production efficiencies) involve the accurate prediction of fish growth. To this end, mathematical models for predicting growth in trout and salmon have been developed and programmed into formats compatible with most commercial microcomputers. This paper describes the seven programs written to date applicable to the intensive production of trout and other salmonids."
