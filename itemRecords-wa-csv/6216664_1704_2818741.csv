13,Abstract:,"Orconectes rusticus (Girard, 1852), known as the rusty crayfish, have spread over the last 50 years from their historical range in the Ohio River drainage, United States, to waters throughout much of 18 additional eastern and central states, provinces of Ontario and Qu�bec in Canada, and the Laurentian Great Lakes (Hobbs et al., 1989; Olden et al., 2006; Taylor et al., 2007). O. rusticus are omnivores and aggressive, resulting in numerous ecological and evolutionary impacts manifested across entire food webs. The invasion of this species has been associated with negative effects on aquatic plants, invertebrates, snails, and fishes (e.g., Olsen et al., 1991; Lodge et al., 1994; McCarthy et al., 2006), in addition to displacing and hybridizing with native crayfish (e.g., Perry et al., 2001). The most westward reported occurrences of O. rusticus are the North Platte River near Douglas, Wyoming (where the population is believed to have been successfully eradicated) and Conchas Lake in north-east New Mexico (Bouchard, 1977). Preventing the westward spread of aquatic nuisance species from eastern North America is a primary goal of the 100th Meridian Initiative (http://www.100​thmeridian.org)​."
