13,Abstract:,"The use of genetic marks, typically allozyme variants, to identify stocks of fish is increasingly common in fisheries and aquaculture studies. These allozyme variants, detected through protein electrophoresisâ€‹, are generally inherited according to simple Mendelian principles and are permanent throughout the life of the organism. This study demonstrated the utility of genetically marking, on a production scale, fish that are too small for other tags, and it showed the benefit of mark transmission to offspring. It is possible to identify genetically marked salmon stocks in mixed-stock aggregations by standard methods now widely used by countries of the North Pacific rim."
