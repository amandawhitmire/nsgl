10,Abstract:,"This study addresses the question of how biological and physical habitat characteristics affect mussel growth in the Padilla Bay estuary in northern Puget Sound. Mussels (""Mytilus edulis"") were placed in cages in habitats dominated by different primary producers and physical characteristicsâ€‹. Growth rates of caged mussels were highest at the mouth of the estuary and lowest in a freshwater slough. However, concentrations of food sources (chlorophyll ""a"" and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen) showed an inverse relationship with growth rates. Physical stresses associated with the habitats appeared to depress growth rates despite high food concentrations. Decreases in growth rates showed a strong positive correlation with decreases in salinity, concentration of inorganic matter in the seston and submergence time. If food sources and physical conditions critical to consumer performance can be determined, prioritization of estuarine habitat management goals may be facilitated."
