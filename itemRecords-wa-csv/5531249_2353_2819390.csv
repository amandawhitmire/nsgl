10,Abstract:,"In the natural environment, selection is caused by largely unknown or uncharacterized circumstances; but in production situations, selection can be directed and controlled in a manner that will yield useful organisms. In this paper salmonid culture is divided into categories and the prevalent selection processes are highlighted and assessed in regard to their anticipated effect on the genetics of the populations involved. Results suggest that selection can be a powerful method to effect desirable genetic changes in populations."
