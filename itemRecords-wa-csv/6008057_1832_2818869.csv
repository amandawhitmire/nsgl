11,Abstract:,"NdEdit is an interactive Java tool developed to facilitate selecting and subsetting data from large in-situ data collections (Osborne and Denbo, 2002). It features display of ocean metadata in six ""cut panels"" views that represent two- dimensional slices through a four-​dimensional region defined by location (latitude, longitude, and depth) and time. It also features filter tools for showing/removin​g data by location and time criteria and selection tools for selecting subsets of data files for processing in other desktop analysis tools."
