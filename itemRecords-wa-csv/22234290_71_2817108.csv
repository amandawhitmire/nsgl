This is commonlycalled direct marketing or alternative marketing.Hundr​eds of fishermen have used the manual and many have said theyfound it helpful. Some readers have suggested improvements and we’veattempted to incorporate those suggestions into this edition. We haveinvited new contributors and incorporated insights from working directmarketers​. We have included new material on branding, products, productplacemen​t, promotion, and use of social media, among other topics.The 5th edition has new sections on accounting, e-commerce, workingwith custom processors, insurance, and more. The state and federal permitsand regulations sections have been updated.In addition to the contributors listed on the title page we would like tothank the direct marketers who offered ideas that have been incorporatedint​o the text, including but not limited to Paula Cullenberg, Nelly Hand,Rick Oltman, Tollef Monson, and Adelia Myrick.
