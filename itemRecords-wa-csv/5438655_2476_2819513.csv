9,Abstract:,"One of the main phases of the EPA Bay Program is to characterize the study region through a system-wide synthesis and analysis of existing data on water and sediment quality and the abundance of living resources, with the objectives of identifying spatial and temporal trends in the estuarine system and evaluating their probable causes. The objective of the project described here was to develop an inventory of the more extensive data sets on marine fishes in Puget Sound. Information on location, date, gear used, number of sets made, depths sampled, and types of data recorded was reviewed and included in the inventory to determine if these data were available in sufficient temporal and spatial coverage and of sufficient quality to evaluate trends in selected species or populations over time."
