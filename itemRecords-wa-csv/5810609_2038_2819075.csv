9,Abstract:,"The plant's defense response against pathogens can be manipulated genetically by the transfer of ""R"" genes (single dominant genes for race-specific disease resistance) or by treatment with elicitors such as chitosan. Both of these manipulations can result in the rapid activation of a subset of genes called PR (pathogenesis-​related) genes. The author of this paper proposes a novel strategy for controlling PR gene expression to transform plants with a chitosan-​inducible gene promoter linked in line with a single signal gene capable of rapid, intense induction of an entire set of PR genes, thereby enabling the control of disease resistance by external chitosan applications."
