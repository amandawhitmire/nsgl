10,Abstract:,"Relations between migratory timing of adult sockeye salmon ""Oncorrhyncus nerka"" and environmental conditions were studied in populations from throughout the species' North American range. General timing of migration varied between populations and was related to spawning time, migration distance, and river temperature and flow regimes. Timing patterns were compared between populations that experienced average peak temperatures greater than 19 degrees C and those that did not. Populations from areas with warm water temperatures had longer delays between migration and spawning (among coastal populations) and more variation in these delays (among both coastal and interior populations.) When riverine conditions related significantly to timing, high flows and low temperatures were associated with late migrations, while low flows and high temperatures were associated with early migrations."
