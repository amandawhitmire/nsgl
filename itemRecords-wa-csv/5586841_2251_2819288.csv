10,Abstract:,"A set of new genetic technologies has been very actively applied to rainbow trout (""Oncorhynchus mykiss"") over the last decade. These techniques are already making significant contributions to rainbow trout aquaculture and appear likely to facilitate detailed genetic analysis of the species. Certain methods face special problems and present novel opportunities in the fish system. This paper reviews the application of chromosome set manipulation, analysis of DNA markers, and gene transfer to rainbow trout; selected questions are raised about future directions of research in these areas. The potential for integrating chromosome set manipulation with analysis of DNA markers and gene transfer is discussed."
