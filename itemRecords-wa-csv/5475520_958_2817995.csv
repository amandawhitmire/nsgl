12,Abstract:,"Growth of population and industry has caused increasingly large quantities of nutrients and other wastes to be introduced into Puget Sound. The major focus of this project is to determine whether changes in nutrient concentrations and the intensities of algal blooms have occurred. Pollutants from pulp mills and sewage discharges are also investigated. Although toxic contaminants are an important concern in Puget Sound, they are not included in this study because of the lack of high quality, long-term data. Recommendations for further studies are offered."
