10,,"The chromosome set manipulation techniques of induced polyploidy, gynogenesis and androgenesis have been extensively investigated in fish in recent years. The major goal of these studies has been to develop methods for the control of sex and for rapid inbreeding in fish, but other applications of these techniques are becoming apparent. In this article, the preferred methods that have developed for inducing polyploidy, gynogenesis and androgenesis in fish are discussed. Probable and possible aquacultural applications of these manipulation techniques are outlined, and critical problems for future investigation proposed."
