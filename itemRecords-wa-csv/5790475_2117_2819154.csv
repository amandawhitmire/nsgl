10,Abstract:,"This document is a book review of ""patterns in the Ocean"": ""Ocean Processes and Marine Population Dynamics"", by Andrew Bakun. Bakun, according to the reviewer, wonders whether mainstream fisheries science, 'like the now-extinct dodo birds of Mauritius', has followed an evolutionary path into a feedback trap of overspecializat​ion. Of most concern is the continuing, seemingly incredible, restriction on the use of ecological and environmental information in attempts to understand and model fish population dynamics. Luckily, Bakun notes, we are not dodo birds. He expresses optimism that our science will expand in breadth, and that breakthroughs will come through the use of pattern recognition, one of the principal tools of the historical/narr​ative scientific method."
