14,Abstract:,"A brief cruise was conducted in July, 1986 in the Middle Atlantic Bight between Baltimore and Washington Canyons to examine along-shelf variability of pycnocline salinity intrusions. A particularly saline intrusion of 35.8 Practical Salinty Units (PSU) was observed at a depth of 70 to 80 m; along-shelf extent was at least 40 km. The cooler, sub-pycnocline outer shelf was displaced 15 km shoreward of the shelfbreak. Temperature-​salinity characteristics of the intrusion suggest that it was a mixture of Gulf Stream water and slope water. These pycnocline intrusions may be an important mechanism for the transport of Gulf Stream-derived water onto the shelf during the summer and may account for some of the along-front variability of the pycnocline salinity maximum that has previously been observed."
