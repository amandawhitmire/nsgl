8,Abstract:,"European frogbit is a free-floating aquatic plant that can quickly choke shallow ponds, open marshes, ditches, and edges of lakes. It is a growing problem in the northeastern U.S., the Great Lakes region, and in Washington state. European frogbit can spread to new waters through improper disposal by water gardeners and by clinging to watercraft, trailers, and equipment. Plants regenerate each spring when overwintering vegetative buds (turions) float to the surface and grow rapidly into tangled mats of interlocking plants. While eradicating established infestations is nearly impossible, your help detecting and reporting new infestations is vital for preventing their spread. This wallet card will assist you."
