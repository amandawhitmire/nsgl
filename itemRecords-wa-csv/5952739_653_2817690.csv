7,Abstract:,"An invasive free-floating aquatic plant called European frogbit (""Hydrocharis morsus-ranae"") has spread along the Ottawa, Rideau, and St. Lawrence rivers into the northeastern U.S. It has also spread to shorelines of Lakes Ontario, Erie, St. Clair, and Champlain and to inland lakes in Washington, New York, and Michigan. This illustrated wallet card will help boaters and others identify European frogbit and take necessary steps to reduce its spread."
