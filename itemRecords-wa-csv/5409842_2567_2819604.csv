13,Abstract:,"Genes which are activated in association with the non-host disease resistance in peas expressed against the fungus ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp. ""phaseoli"", a pathogen of beans, have been cloned. These same genes become suppressed in the susceptibility reaction of peas to ""F. solani"" f. sp. ""pisi"", a pea pathogen. Recently race-specific resistance in peas against three races of ""Pseudomonas syringae"" pv. ""pisi"", has been described; therefore the authors have evaluated the response of these non-host resistance pea genes in this race-specific interaction. Regulatory components in the non-host resistance response of peas and the common features of this reponse to that of race-specific resistance are discussed."
