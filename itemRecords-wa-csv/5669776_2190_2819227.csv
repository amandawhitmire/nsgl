11,Abstract:,"Resource managers, industrial leaders, coastal cleanup organizers, waste management officials, scientists, conservationist​s and leaders of international organizations came to the Third International Conference on Marine Debris with papers to present ideas about how the amounts and the impacts of marine debris could be lessened globally. Topics included debris survey methods, impacts on ecosystems and organisms, sources, international treaties, legislation, cleanup strategies, new technology, education, enforcement, source reduction, recycling, and waste management. This booklet summarizes the information, ideas and solutions presented at the conference. They range from the drafting of simple educational messages to the development of new technologies. But all are directed at a single outcome-- reduction of the debris that floats at the ocean's surface, litters its underwater habitat, and mars the shorelines along its boundaries."
