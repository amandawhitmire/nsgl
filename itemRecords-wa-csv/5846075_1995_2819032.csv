10,Abstract:,"Commercial cultivation of the red alga ""Porphyra yezoensis,""(nor​i), was initiated in Cobscook Bay and South Bay, Maine in 1991 by Coastal Plantations International, Inc. The transfer and modification of Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Washington State's nori cultivation and processing technologies to Maine has resulted in the world's first internationally certified, organically cultivated and processed nori. In this article, the author reports on a variety of issues related to North American nori cultivation, such as the market, productivity, leasing and permitting, and genetic modification."
