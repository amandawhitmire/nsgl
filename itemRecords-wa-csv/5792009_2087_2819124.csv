11,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of building a seawater battery using cheap, readily available materials. Results show that magnesium anodes outperform aluminum. Cathodes composed of copper or stainless-steel mesh performed reasonably well. Deep-and shallow-water tests showed that a battery occupying 1 m3 could produce 5 W for a year or more in oxygen-â€‹saturated waters and 1-2 W in the oxygen-starved waters of the North Pacific seafloor. The energy density of such a battery including flotation necessary for optimal performance and recovery was estimated to be 150-400 Wh kg-1."
