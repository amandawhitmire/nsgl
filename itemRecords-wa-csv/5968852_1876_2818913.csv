12,Abstract:,"The ability to fix nitrogen is widely distributed among phylogeneticall​y diverse bacteria but appears to be limited to the methanogens within ""Archaea"". Nitrogenase, the enzyme complex that catalyzes nitrogen fixation, is composed of two proteins: the iron protein, or dinitrogenase reductase, and the molybdenum iron protein, or dinitrogenase. The ""nifH"" gene encodes the iron protein. This paper describes the phylogenetic diversity of ""nifH"" genes in a nitrogen-poor hydrothermal vent habitat sampled twice over a period of one year, during which the fluid temperature decreased; a nitrogen-rich hydrothermal vent habitat; and background deep seawater. The results indicate that the ""nifH"" genes present in hydrothermal fluid originate from a diverse ""nifH"" assemblage in the subseafloor as well as a phylogeneticall​y distinct ""nifH"" assemblage in ambient deep seawater."
