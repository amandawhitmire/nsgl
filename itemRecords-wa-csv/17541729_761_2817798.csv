14,Abstract:,"Foraminiferal assemblages in sediment grab samples were utilized to evaluate the impacts of anthropogenicac​tivities on benthic habitats in Bellingham Bay, Washington State, U.S.A. Seventy-three samplestaken in 1987, 1997, 2006 and 2010 yielded 35 species of foraminifera from 28 genera. Assemblage compositionand diversity data indicate a marked deterioration between 1987 and 2010, contrary to the publishedChemic​al Index, but analogous to the situation with macrobiota. Correlation of diversity withchemical pollutants and metals did not identify any significant correlations, however, an unrelated buthighly relevant study of bottom water dissolved oxygen concentrations and pH in Bellingham Bay suggestseutroph​ication with accompanying hypoxia and acidification may be part of the cause. Thus, themetrics of contamination alone do not adequately characterize habitat viability, and benthic foraminiferalas​semblages provide insight into the health of coastal ecosystems."
