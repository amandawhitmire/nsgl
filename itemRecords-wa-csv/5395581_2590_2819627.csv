11,Abstract:,"This paper compares growth and gonadal development of triploid and diploid coho salmon in three treatment groups. The comparisons were made in fresh and seawater from the time of smoltification at 18 months to sexual maturity at 30 months. No differences were detected in the ability of triploids to smoltify and to successfully adapt to seawater. Likewise, no differences were observed in growth parameters (length, body weight or condition factor). Gonadal development in both sexes was severely retarded in all triploid groups at 30 months of age. Vitellogenin was undetectable in triploid females, but was present in diploid females; a correlated reduction in the hepato-somatic index was observed in triploid relative to diploid females. However, no significant differences between levels of estradiol in the plasma of tripoids and diploids were detected at this time."
