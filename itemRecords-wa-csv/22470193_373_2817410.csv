14,Abstract:,"After the 2012 discovery of European green crab (Carcinus maenas, referred to hereafter as green crab) in Vancouver Island’s Sooke Basin, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and the Pacific After the 2012 discovery of European green crab (Carcinus maenas, referred to hereafter as green crab) in Vancouver Island’s Sooke Basin, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) sought support to reestablish a sustainable, volunteer-based monitoring network with the primary goal being early detection of European green crab. In 2014, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funds, through the Puget Sound Marine and Nearshore Protection & Restoration Grant Program, were awarded to Washington Sea Grant (WSG), a unit of the University of Washington College of the Environment, to develop and implement a program combining a rigorous green crab monitoring strategy with a broad outreach effort. The resulting program, WSG’s Crab Team, was designed to increase the likelihood of finding and controlling green crab before established populations threaten Puget Sound shellfish and fish species and habitats."
