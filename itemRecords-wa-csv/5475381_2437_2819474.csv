10,Abstract:,"The mechanisms by which chitosan can both activate plant genes and inhibit fungal growth are not presently known. Previous research has suggested that chitosan functions by altering the local Ca2+ concentration at the cell wall and plasma membrane of the host-fungal interface or by releasing bound intracellular Ca2+. This study shows that changes in exogenous Ca2+ levels, blockage of Ca2+ channels and inhibition of calmodulin do not alter some of the assayable chitosan or fungal-induced disease resistance responses, and do not alter induction of pisatin formation."
