9,Abstract:,"The Galveston Bay estuary is the second largest coastal embayment in the State of Texas and is surrounded by a population of nearly three million people in the Houston region. Galveston Bay provides avenues for navigation, cooling water for industries, a receptacle for discharges, a playground for outdoor recreation and a pantry for seafood. All of these often conflicting uses have taken Galveston Bay close to the environmental precipice of degradation. Only with careful and prudent management can Galveston Bay be as 'all-serving' in the future as it has in the past. It was this task of preserving the ecological balances in Galveston Bay that coalesced this group of concerned scientists and managers to present a holistic overview of what is known about the health of Galveston Bay, detail the multiple use conflicts and present a summary of research needs that would be useful for management."
