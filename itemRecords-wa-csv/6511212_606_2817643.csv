9,Abstract:,"Washington State is in the process of moving from reactive to proactive Vibrio parahaemolyticu​s (Vibrio) management. In the current Vibrio control plan, the occurrence of sporadic illnesses triggers time-​to-​temperature reductions and growing areas closures. The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) is working with a Vibrio Advisory Committee comprised of industry members and other interested stakeholders to move towards risk-based Vibrio management. A key component of moving towards a proactive management approach is collecting and analyzing environmental monitoring data. With well-​established links between Vibrio growth and temperature (Nordstrom et al. 2004; Oberbeckmann et al. 2012), it is critical that DOH expand monitoring efforts to include continuous water temperature data collection. The NEP funded component of this work will focus on collecting temperature data from 17 Vibrio monitoring sites in order to better understand the relationship between temperature and Vibrio growth. The results of this study will be combined with other data to inform a proactive Vibrio management approach for the State of Washington."
