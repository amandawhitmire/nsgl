9,Abstract:,"One problem encountered by producers of both fresh and frozen seafood is product dehydration. Processors of frozen fish, especially those using blast freezers, find it difficult to prevent moisture loss because of the large volumes of air that circulate around the product during freezing. Subsequent cold storage, especially of poorly protected product, accelerates the dehydration process, sometimes referred to as freezer burn. Understanding the situations that promote dehydration and the techniques for preventing it can help safeguard against this destroyer of quality."
