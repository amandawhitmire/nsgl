12,Abstract:,"Diel molting cycles of megalopae and first instar Dungeness crabs (Cancer magister"" captured in May were studied under laboratory conditions. Sixty-one percent of the megalopae and 76% of the first instar crabs molted during periods of ambient darkness under a normal light - dark diel regime, and molting pattern was not affected by changes in the photoperiod (24 h daylight or 24 h darkness). Time until metamorphic molt increased as conspecific density increased. Habitat type (shell or mud) did not affect tie until molt of megalopae and first instar crabs, nor did it affect daily molting rhythm of first instars. Nightly ecdysis of megalopae and first instar Dungeness crabs and density-​dependent molting may be an adaptive response to predation and cannibalism among young-​of-​the-​year."
