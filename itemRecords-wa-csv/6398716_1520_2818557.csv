13,Abstract:,"In most organisms, an internal circadian clock coordinates the expression of biological rhythms and enables individuals to anticipate and respond to the seasonally changing environment. There is remarkable conservation of function in the molecular machinery underlying this circadian clock across taxa with 4 canonical proteins interacting to form an autoregulatory feedback loop: CLOCK, CRYPTOCHROME, PERIOD, and BMAL. We mapped duplicated copies of Clock and Cryptochrome in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to determine if these genes localize to quantitative trait loci (QTL) for hatch timing, weight, length, and growth rate measured throughout the juvenile life-history stage. We found that Cryptochrome2b mapped to a QTL region for growth (measured at 304 days post-hatching) on linkage group OKI06. The percentage of variation (PEV) explained by this QTL was 15.2%. Cryptochrome2b was also associated with a marginally nonsignificant QTL for length (measured at 395 days post-hatching). OtsClock1b mapped to a QTL region for growth rate (PEV 10.1%) and length (PEV 10.5%) on linkage group OKI24 (measured at 479 days posthatching). Neither gene localized to QTL for hatch timing or weight. Our findings indicate that the growth rate and length QTL associated with OtsClock1b and Cryptochrome2b are development stage-specific and may result from temporally differentiated gene expression patterns."
