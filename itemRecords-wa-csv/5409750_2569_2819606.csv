10,Abstract:,"Comparative gene mapping may provide a valuable means to estimate phylogenetic relationships and probe evolutionary mechanisms. The authors are interested in studying the evolution of Pacific salmon (""Oncorhynchus"" sp.) by comparing gene map distances among species and between this and other salmonid genera. For an initial comparison, reported here, the authors chose to collect map data in chum salmon, ""Oncorhynchus keta"", and compare these findings with data from rainbow trout."
