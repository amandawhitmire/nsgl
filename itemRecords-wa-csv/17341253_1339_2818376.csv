15,Abstract:,"This report communicates findings of a social science study conducted between July 2013 and December 2014 on a focal domain of human well-being: sense of place. The purpose of this research is to examine the connections between sense of place and human well-being for Puget Sound residents in the context of shoreline activities: primarily, though not exclusively, shellfish harvesting. While it is generally agreed that a healthy Puget Sound is central to overall human well-being, there is a lack of understanding about how sense of place influences and is influenced by human actions and human well-being. We chose to investigate these influences through the lens of shellfish harvesting and other shoreline activities, with the hypothesis that people who are active in the shoreline area will have a stronger place attachment. Elucidating sense of place as a domain of human well-being improves understanding of why people support or reject restoration activities, as well as illustrates how and why sense of place could be strengthened in planning and policy. Our hope is that by building a better understanding of the place-based practices, histories, and diverse values that form sense of place for Puget Sound denizens, Puget Sound Partnership will be poised to be in the vanguard of marine socio-​ecological system management by placing human well-being as a central objective. In this study, we use interdisciplina​ry methods from anthropology, human geography, public health, and the decision sciences to assess the interrelated ways that sense of place, shellfish harvesting, and other shoreline activities contribute to human well-being in Puget Sound. We used two main methodological tools to empirically assess the relationships between sense of place, well-being, and activities in the nearshore (i.e. areas near the shore): in-depth semi-structured interviewing; and, data verification and values elicitation workshops. In combination, these methods produced new insights into the multi-​dimensional characteristics of sense of place for diverse communities. Further, they illuminated the differing challenges that various groups face in trying to maintain or restore a desired quality of life in connection with maintaining and restoring the Puget Sound. People foster unique stewardship ethics grounded in place-based practices that are not otherwise acknowledged or reflected in current ecosystem assessment and restoration approaches used in Puget Sound. The integration and examination of more complex measures of sense of place is important precisely because of the role of relational-and practice-based place attachments in developing stewardship and restoration ethics for people. Since the overarching goal of PSP is restoration, this fuller understanding of sense of place deserves stronger centrality in policy, monitoring, and action. Our results suggest the importance of understanding and improving the conditions (e.g., access, knowledge, and ecological integrity) that enable the continuum of place attachments, for ecological improvements as well as human well-being and quality of life."
