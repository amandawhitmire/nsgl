9,Abstract:,The following analysis was conducted to evaluate progress toward reducing albatross bycatch in the Alaska longline fisheries and to suggest where performance might be improved. Seabird bycatch rates (birds per million hooks for all figures) for Alaska longline fisheries were derived from data collected by the NOAA Fisheries North Pacific Observer Program. Results are from observed haul samples and were not extrapolated beyond the sample or to the entire fleet.
