8,Abstract:,"New limits are in place on the number of albatrosses that can be taken in the West Coast groundfish fisheries, and new streamer line requirements are coming on line in 2014 for larger vessels catching groundfish with longline gear. We need your help to put together a research program with industry to find practical and effective ways to prevent albatross deaths in these longline fisheries, especially for smaller vessels in the fleet. On this site, please find information we think you will find useful: proven seabird avoidance measures, how to get free streamer lines, more about pending restrictions, our research and how to become involved, albatross species identification, and what to do if you catch an albatross."
