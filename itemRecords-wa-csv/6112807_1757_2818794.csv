8,,"Environmental Best Management Practices (BMPs) are those practices selected by a systematic process and judged as good, exemplary or successfully demonstrated to reduce negative impacts on the environment. ""Best"" is a contextual term. Those practices adopted by your tourism business will depend on what stage of development you are in, as well as your executive commitment. This commitment presumes a willingness to strive for a level of performance that exceeds basic regulatory compliance requirements or common standards of practice. The lodging BMPs apply to the types of properties such as hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts, guest houses, and hostels. There is also a special section in the Food and Beverage Section which pertains to restaurants, including buying local food and highlighting the bounty from our local environment."
