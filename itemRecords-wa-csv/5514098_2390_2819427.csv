11,Abstract:,"The selective uptake and retention of saxitoxin in the siphon of butter clams results in both short- and long-term toxicity. Two explanations have been proposed for the origin of saxitonin in this clam. First, the siphon could initially acquire low levels of saxitoxins from ingested ""Alexandrium"" spp. Second, the conversion of gonyautoxin to saxitoxin may subsequently result in high levels of saxitoxin in the siphon. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether nontoxic butter clams fed ""A. catenella"" containing gonyautoxin and neosaxitoxin, but no saxitoxin, would accumulate saxitoxin in the siphon. Saxitoxin was detected, mainly in the siphon, after a delay; its origin is still being investigated."
