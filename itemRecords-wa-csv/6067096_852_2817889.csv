10,Abstract:,"This report places the recent decline in Willapa Bay oyster condition into a century-long context. It demonstrates that the climate of the Pacific Northwest has fluctuated on a semi-regular basis, and shows that the recent decline in oyster condition has accompanied the current warm, dry portion of the climate cycle in the region. This correlation suggests that oyster condition may be controlled by climate, and that when the climate returns to cool, wet conditions, oyster condition should improve. If this correlation holds, there is cause for optimism that the oyster industry can look ahead to improved oyster condition in a few years. However, even if oyster condition were proven to be climate-driven, it is far from certain that the cool, wet conditions of the past will return on schedule or at all. Therefore, considerable uncertainty remains about the future of oyster condition in Washington waters."
