34,Abstract:,"We modeled water resources and land use change driven by climate change, population growth, and economic growth over the 21st century in the 30,000-sq-km Willamette Basin of Oregon. Results suggest that, at the basin scale and over an annual time scale, water quantity is relatively resilient to climate change. Downscaled general circulation model outputs indicate warming temperatures through the century, but similar precipitation totals and timing. Although climate change is likely to significantly reduce snow pack, which will reduce summer stream flow, snowmelt currently makes up less than 20% of the basinâ€™s water budget in any month. In the lowlands, although total urban water demand will increase due to population and income growth, the accompanying expansion of urban areas into previously irrigated farmland mean that consumptive water use in parts of the basin may, in fact, decrease in the 21st century. However, deeper summer drought may become common, particularly at higher elevations. Cascade-sourced stream flows may become less reliable in late summer, and higher elevation soils may become drier. As a fraction of total water available, consumptive use may be higher in the summer in part because of reduced stream flow. The Willamette Basin population will likely more than double, causing urban water consumptive use to exceed summer surface irrigation diversions by the end of the century."
