11,Abstract:,"A few miles north of Port Washington, the charred and scattered remains of the old steamer, ""Niagara"" rest in fifty feet of water in Lake Michigan. Between 1846 and 1856, steamers were a familiar sight along the western Lake Michigan coast as the boats-​-​especially the ""Niagara""-- brought thousands of settlers to new homes in Wisconsin. The wreck of the ""Niagara"", which burned in the fall of 1856, is a memorial to early transportation and settlement in Wisconsin and an invaluable source for understanding antebellum maritime technology on the Great Lakes. Over recent years underwater archeologists and historians from the State Historical Society of Wisconsin and volunteer divers from the Wisconsin Underwater Archeological Association have recaptured the Great Lakes palace steamer era with their investigations of the steamer ""Niagara"". This article elaborates."
