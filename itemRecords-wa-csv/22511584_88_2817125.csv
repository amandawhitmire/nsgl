10,Abstract:,"The National Conference on Tire Breakwater Structures was held on May 23, 1977, in Annapolis, Maryland. The conference was sponsored by the National Sea Grant NMAS (NOAA) in cooperation with the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency. This conference followed the 1974 Floating Breakwaters Conference co-sponsored by the University of Rhode Island and the University of Washington Sea Grant Programs and the 1976 Tire Shore Protection workshop sponsored by the University of Rhode Island Marine Advisory Service in cooperation with the National Sea Grant Program and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. The objective of this conference was to foster the continued exchange of information and ideas regarding tire breakwater research use and regulation. Participants included individuals directly involved in activities related to tire breakwater utilization as well as potential tire breakwater users. This volume is a compilation of the papers presented and a listing of conference participants. The following papers are included in this document: (1) Scrap tire shore protection structures, by R.D. Candle and W.J. Fischer; (2) Constructing floating tire breakwaters, by Neil W. Ross; (3) Enhancing Great Lakes harbor protection: The Dunkirk Experience, by Bruce DeYoung; (4) Evaluation of tying materials for floating tire breakwaters, by A.P.
