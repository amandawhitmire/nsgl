10,Abstract:,"This paper directly examines conditions under which fishermen are likely to support entry restrictions. For many fishermen the risk of exclusion outweighs the expected gain from restricted competition. When fishermen do advocate entry restrictions, they do so when the expected net gain is positive. One factor that affects the net gain is the variability of fishing income. An exact option-based model is developed to value entry licenses. This model offers the important advantage of requiring information only on factors that can be easily estimated, and it yields comparative static results that can be used to assess the effects on license values of environmental or regulatory changes."
