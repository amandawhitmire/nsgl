13,Abstract:,"This chapter from the book, ""Cooperating with Nature,"" examines the choices that face local officials when they use hazard assessment, and summarizes the practice and art in applying hazard assessment to evaluate and implement alternative land use planning and management strategies. Discussion includes a summary of the state of practice for floods, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes and coastal erosions, and wildfires. One conclusion, among others, is that geographical information systems and digitized land use data had opened the way for the development and use of probabilistic risk analysis to predict the impacts and assess the cost and benefits of alternative plans and land management strategies."
