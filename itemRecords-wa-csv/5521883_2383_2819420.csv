12,Abstract:,"Rubisco, ribulose-​1,5-​bisphosphate carboxylase, is present in all photoautotrophi​c cells. In this study the Rubisco enzymes present in two ancient evolutionary lineages of algae are examined. This analysis of Rubisco from the chromophyte ""Olisthodiscus luteus"" and rhodophyte ""Griffithsia pacifica"" represents the first detailed biochemical study of Rubisco in red algae and demonstrates that an extensive similarity in Rubisco structure and function exists between chromophytes and rhodophytes which differs substantially from the properties of the prokaryotic and chlorophytic plant enzymes."
