21,Abstract:,"Statements made at the recent UN Climate Conference 23rd session of the Conference of theParties (COP23) clearly indicated that Pacific islands, countries, and territories (PICTs) areparticularly susceptible to sociocultural, economic and environmental impacts of climate change.The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) are one such group of islands where internal andexternal climate forcing has observable detrimental impacts on local public health, water quality,agricul​ture and resource management. Here, we present the outcomes of a collaboration betweengraduate students and a PICTs-focused non-profit organization to facilitate a climate-​relatedknowledg​e network that addresses adaptation to climate-related vulnerabilities in Pohnpei, FSM.Through a series of workshops targeting K-8 science teachers, this network strengthens lines ofcommunication between educators, resource managers, stakeholders and environmental leadersand provides a forum for ongoing information exchange to encourage adaptation to climatechange in island communities. Additionally, teacher participation in the workshops resulted in amarked increase in community engagement in other local and regional educational venues. Wepropose that the knowledge network piloted here serves as an interdisciplina​ry model of a sustainable educational partnership that can be adapted for use in a multitude of PICT communitiesto improve preparedness and reduce susceptibility to climate-​associated stressors, thereby providing an example of means to achieve key goals of the COP23."
