11,Abstract:,"Exvessel price defines how industry profits will be distributed between processors and fishermen. This paper summarizes a relatively simple model of exvessel price formation for Bristol Bay red king crab. The model portrays exvessel price as a proportion of wholesale price expectations. Two important conclusions of this analysis concern the role of the Japanese exchange rate and the notion of 'price equity' in determining the proportion of wholesale price expectation to be captured by fishermen. Exvessel price is most responsive to changes in the exchange rate. Moreover, both fishermen and processors are sensitive to whether an equitable distribution of rents (profits) occurred the previous fishing season."
