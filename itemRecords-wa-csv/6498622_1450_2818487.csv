10,Abstract:,"The Kosrae Coastal Resource Atlas was prepared by the Environmental Resources Section of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pacific Ocean Division. It is the companion volume to the Kosrae Coastal Resource Inventory, a report on the same topic prepared by the Corps. The Corps' coastal resource inventory Program has been under the direction of James E. Maragos since its initiation in 1978. The Kosrae Coastal Resource Atlas was coordinated by Dr. Maragos, who also supervised the development of the data base, map editing, and publication, and compiled the maps. Ross Cordy provided the information on coastal archaeological sites, Michael Baker interpreted and mapped the seagrass beds and additional mangrove and swamp areas, and Michael White and Bruce Howell assisted in mapping areas recently modified by dredge and fill operations. The atlas was designed and produced by Jane J. Eckelman of Manoa Mapworks, Honolulu, with technical assistance by Michael E. Baker and Everett A. Wingert, of Honolulu. The relief shading was drawn by Dr. John C. Sherman of Seattle, Washington. Black and white aerial photographs were taken in 1985 by Perry and Associates, Guam. Funding for the atlas was provided under the authority of section 22 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 (PL 93-251), as amended (Planning Assistance to the States)."
