10,Abstract:,"In the State of Washington, there are 12 Indian tribes with reservations fronting on salt water, and in recent years, tribal leaders have become increasingly aware of the value of these lands. As a result, tribes have sought and received assistance from a number of agencies to help develop various economic potentials of these tribally owned marine resources. One agency to whom the Indians have turned for help is the Washington Sea Grant program, and that program has responded with advice and guidance for farming and marketing fish. The Washington Sea Grant advisory program has been working through an Indian liaison student with coastal Indian tribes of Washington to develop their marine resources. Since many marine prospects require trained personnel, it is essential that Indians be trained for all positions in areas from management to various technical fields. The Indian liaison's primary function is to help Indian students acquire training. He works with Indians and educators to find the reasons for the high rate of school drop out among Indians."
