8,Abstract:,"The primary purpose of this study is to assess whether water quality in Puget Sound has changed over time, focusing primarily on nutrient enrichment and the enhancement of algal blooms. The physical variables investigated are salinity and water temperature; chemical variables, dissolved oxygen, inorganic nitrate, and orthophosphate. Algal bloom intensity is measured by the concentration of chlorophyll ""a"", percent dissolved oxygen saturation in surface water, and Secchi disk depth. The concentration of sulfite waste liquor is evaluated as an index of pulp mill pollution, and fecal coliform bacteria count as an index of sewage contamination (although toxic contaminants are an important environmental concern in Puget Sound, they were not investigated during this study). Suggestions for ongoing monitoring studies are made."
