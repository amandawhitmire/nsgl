10,Abstract:,"While marine nearshore environments are some of the most resource-rich and economically important ecosystems in the world, the structure, functions, and processes that form and maintain habitats in these systems are complex and poorly understood. Of the many habitats constituting the nearshore, perhaps the least understood and most unappreciated, in terms of critical functions, are riparian areas. Riparian areas have been studied intensely in recent years because of their critical functional relationships to stream and freshwater wetland ecosystems. Marine riparian areas, on the other hand, have received little attention. Although marine riparian systems have not been subject to the same level of scientific investigation, a growing body of evidence suggests that riparian systems serve similar functions regardless of the salinity of the water bodies they border. While riparian areas and shoreline vegetation have been identified as integral and important parts of the marine nearshore ecosystem, their functions and benefits have not been adequately evaluated and integrated into shoreline management strategies. Recognizing this gap in our knowledge and the apparent links between shoreline vegetation and the nearshore ecosystem based on personal observations, the authors began an investigation with a preliminary review of the scientific literature and interviews with other marine scientists. Their working hypothesis is that marine riparian systems provide functions similar to those described for freshwater riparian systems and are likely to provide additional functions unique to marine nearshore ecosystems. Following this preliminary assessment, they conducted a more extensive literature review and assessment of riparian functions relative to marine systems."
