15,Abstract:,"The authors review a pilot study and associated research that led to the current policy of mitigating for the loss of Dungeness crab by creating intertidal shell habitat in Washington State coastal estuaries. They describe problems with the implementation of the policy, and summarize potential solutions that have been developed based on continued research. Also discussed is a mitigation strategy that attempts to take advantage of natural oyster recruitment. This is a novel approach to creating habitat for a decapod crustacean on the West Coast of North America."
