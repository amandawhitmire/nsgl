8,Abstract:,"One of the popular recreational activities in Garrison Bay (WA) is clam digging. During the past five years this harvest has been monitored and data collected on species weight and size distributions, as well as the time needed to dig each catch. In addition, a periodic survey by stratified random sampling determines the abundance and size distributions of the unharvested standing stocks. These latter data are presented for the littleneck clam, ""Protothaca staminea"", the species most commonly taken."
