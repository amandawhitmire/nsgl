10,Abstract:,"Our highest annual tides are called king tides. They occur when one or more astronomical events happen at the same time. While king tides are not caused by sea level rise, they do give us a glimpse of the future: today’s king tides are comparable to normal water levels in our future. Sea level rise will make today’s extreme water levels even higher. Here, Westport, WA is shown with one foot of sea level rise plus four feet of additional water from a 100-year event, such as extreme tides or storm surge. One foot of sea level rise is likely for Westport by the year 2080, under a high emissions scenario. (map credit: NOAA Sea Level Rise Viewer)"
