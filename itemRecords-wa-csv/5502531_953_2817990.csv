9,Abstract:,"Have you lost the traditional market for your catch? Experienced a drop in prices offered for your product? Or are you just trying to keep up with skyrocketing expenses? Whatever your reason, like many of your fellow fishermen, you may be interested in selling your catch directly to the general public, to retailers, or to restaurants. In order to protect both yourself and the consumer, you need to follow the legal--and sanitary-​-​requirements for operating this type of business. This bulletin explains the requirements in Washington State for you to sell unprocessed fish and shellfish to the general public from your own boat or vehicle."
