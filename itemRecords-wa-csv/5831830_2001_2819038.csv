12,Abstract:,"The Cuban seafood industry has long been an important supplier of certain high valued seafood products for the world market, In addition, the industry has historically played an important role in providing seafood products for the domestic markets in Cuba. Assistance from the Soviet Union led to the development of a large distant-water fleet, which produced large volumes of low-valued seafood products. The nearshore fleets continued to produce high valued species for export markets. The loss of Soviet assistance following the breakup of the Soviet Union has dramatically affected the manner in which the Cuban fishing industry is conducted. More recently, the management of the nearshore fleet, associated service industries, and the processing facilities is being conducted in a more decentralized manner, In particular, this strategy allows much more control by fleet operators of the various harvesting activities. The Cuban fishing fleet now concentrates on the production of high-valued species such as spiny lobster, shrimp, reef fish, tunas, sponges and others, Renewed trade with the US would provide market opportunities for several of these species."
