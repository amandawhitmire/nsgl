9,Abstract:,"Recent studies strongly suggest the existence of a subseafloor biosphere at mid-ocean ridges, yet little is known about the diversity of bacteria and archaea in the subseafloor, how perturbations such as eruptive events affect the microbial community, if off-axis subseafloor environments host a biosphere, and the distribution of subseafloor populations in individual vents. In order to address such issues, this thesis predicts that the physiological and phylogenetic diversity of microbes in low temperature hydrothermal diffuse fluids can be used to further describe and understand the subseafloor environment. Two contrasting subseafloor environments are examined, Axial Seamount and Baby Bare Seamount, both located in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The former is a young active mid-ocean ridge volcano with magma-driven fluid circulation, while the latter is a sedimented outcrop located on 3.5 Ma oceanic crust. The thesis is divided into four main topics focused on the subseafloor. First, an examination of the temporal changes in bacterial diversity and geochemistry in the subseafloor at Axial in response to an eruptive event found an increase both in the overall bacterial diversity in vent fluids n and in the microbes that appear to be indigenous to the vent environment, such as the ""epsilon""-​proteobacteria. Second, the application of a combination of molecular analyses, culturing, and geochemical signatures of fluids determined that a unique subseafloor population of microbes does exist in Baby Bare crustal fluids, consisting of thermophiles belonging to the ""Thermosipho"" spp., ""Thermococcales​"" spp., and ""Desulfurobacte​rium"" spp., as well as novel uncultured archaea not detected at Axial. Third, key physiological characteristics of a novel cultured microorganism from diffuse fluids were identified, such as exopolysacchari​de production and autotrophy, and indicate adaptation to subseafloor habitats. Finally, a group of subseafloor indicator organisms belonging to the ""Thermococcales​"" were isolated from multiple vent sites and studied using culturing and molecular methods to determine their in-situ diversity and distribution. These microbiological data in combination with the geochemical properties of diffuse fluids allow us to further constrain the subseafloor ecosystem in both mid-ocean ridge and off-axis seamounts."
