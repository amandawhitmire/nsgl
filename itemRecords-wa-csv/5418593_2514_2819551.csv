10,Abstract:,"Thiamin is a required dietary nutrient for cultured fish. Yearling rainbow trout (""Salmo gairdneri"") were fed a purified diet with and without thiamin supplementation for 30 wk, at which time overt signs of thiamin deficiency appeared in the latter group, including anorexia, darkening and ataxia. Death followed rapidly. Thiamin pyrophosphate levels in erythrocytes and liver were found to be a more sensitive indicator of thiamin status of rainbow trout than erythrocyte or liver transketolase activity."
