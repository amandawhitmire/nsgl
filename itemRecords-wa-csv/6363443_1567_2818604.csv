10,Abstract:,"Many assessment models evaluate stock status, and biases can arise when time-varying processes are modelled as being time-invariant. An ""auxiliary/foca​l"" assessment process is presented, where an ""auxiliary"" assessment model estimates functional parameters that are used in a ""focal"" assessment of stock status. This process is evaluated in two steps. First, estimates of density-​dependent catchability from single- or multispecies auxiliary models are compared, confirming that multispecies auxiliary models are more accurate when catch-at-age data are abundant. Possible output from the multispecies auxiliary assessment is then used in a focal model, and the results are compared with four other methods: (i) assuming that catchability is constant, (ii) ignoring fishery-​dependent indices, (iii) a random-walk catchability model, and (iv) estimating density-​dependent catchability without prior information. Results show that the constant catchability model leads to non-​conservative biases in stock-status estimates, and a random-walk model decreases bias and has high precision when age data are available. The auxiliary/focal procedure performs best when fishery indices are used without age data, and the density-​dependent model without prior information performs well with fishery and survey indices, but without age data. Different methods are optimal, therefore, depending on data availability, and the auxiliary/focal assessment process performs best of the available methods when using just fishery-​dependent indices."
