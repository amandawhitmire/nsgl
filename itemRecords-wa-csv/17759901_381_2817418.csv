10,Abstract:,"Aggressive, adaptable and highly invasive, the European green crab has disturbed and diminished coastal ecosystems worldwide. But it hadn’t appeared in Puget Sound…until this year. In August 2016, a single green crab was captured on San Juan Island, at the northwestern edge of this region’s vulnerable waters. Four additional crabs were found a few weeks later at the Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve."
