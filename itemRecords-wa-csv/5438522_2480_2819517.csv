12,Abstract:,The experiments summarized in this paper were undertaken to determine the times at which thyroid hormones are present in eggs and larval tissues of striped bass and in the plasma of five species of salmonid larvae. Findings are considered in light of the information available on the responses of embryonic and larval teleosts to thyroid and antithyroid compounds.
