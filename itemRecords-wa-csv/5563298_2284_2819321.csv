11,Abstract:,"The increasing competitiveness of the marine transportation industry has brought about demands that container terminal productivity be improved. The U.S. Maritime Administration, in cooperation with the National Research Council, has responded by developing a number of quantitative measurements for container terminal productivity. In this paper the problems and prospects of using such measurements to estimate or compare the productivity of terminals or ports are discussed. Because physical and institutional factors act to limit the productivity of every container terminal, quantitative productivity comparisons among terminals or ports may lead to misplaced efforts to improve the productivity of particular operational elements. By contrast, a sensible strategy for managing productivity would involve the linking of productivity and cost data, so that existing productivity constraints can be intelligently shifted from one area of operations to another."
