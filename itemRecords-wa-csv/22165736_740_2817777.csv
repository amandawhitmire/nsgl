10,Abstract:,"With a dynamic new story map, our Washington Sea Grant State Fellow Forrest Howk reflects on the differences among adaptation strategies at country, the community, and individual levels. Whether on the Pacific islands at the front lines of climate change, in Washington's agricultural valleys or all points between, the impacts of global warming call for community-led, local adaptation. Dig deeper to learn about the people and places facing today's greatest climate challenges and what their experiences and adaptations can teach us closer to home."
