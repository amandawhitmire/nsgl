19,Abstract:,"Pacific salmon exposed to sublethal concentrations of organophosphate pesticides (OP) have impaired olfactory functionthat can lead to loss of behaviors that are essential for survival. These exposures often involve mixtures and can occur atlevels below those which inhibit acetylcholinest​erase (AChE). In this study, juvenile Coho salmon were exposed for 24h toeither 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 ppb chlorpyrifos (CPF), 2, 10, or 50 ppb malathion (MAL), or binary mixtures of 0.1 CPF:2 ppb MAL, 0.5CPF:10 ppb MAL, or 2.5 CPF:10 ppb MAL to mimic single and binary environmental exposures. Microarray analysis ofolfactory rosettes from pesticide-​exposed salmon revealed differentially expressed genes involved in nervous systemfunction and signaling, aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, xenobiotic metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Cohoexposed to OP mixtures exhibited a more pronounced loss in detection of a predatory olfactory cue relative to thoseexposed to single compounds, whereas respirometry experiments demonstrated that exposure to OPs, individually and inmixtures, reduced maximum respiratory capacity of olfactory rosette mitochondria. The observed molecular, biochemical,and behavioral effects occurred largely in the absence of effects on brain AChE. In summary, our results provide newinsights associated with the sublethal neurotoxic effects of OP mixtures relevant to environmental exposures involvingmolecu​lar and cellular pathways of injury to the salmon olfactory system that underlie neurobehavioral injury."
