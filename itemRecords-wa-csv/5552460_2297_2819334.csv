10,Abstract:,"Reported here are the isolation and physical organization of chloroplast DNA from the economically important red alga ""Porphyra yezoensis"". The genome maps as a circular, inverted repeat-​containing molecule which carries several genes not found in higher plant chloroplasts. These include the phycobiliprotei​n genes, the gene for the small subunit polypeptide of ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxy​genase, and the gene for the polypeptide elongation factor EF-TU. In addition, part of the ""Porphyra"" chloroplast genome has sequence homology to some plasmid-like DNA molecules that co-isolate with chloroplast DNA."
