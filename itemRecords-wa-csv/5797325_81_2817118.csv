20,Abstract:,"The National Sea Grant College Program (NSGCP) has existed since 1967, three years longer than the agency in which it presently resides, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NSGCP has provided an important mechanism over the years for NOAA to access the broad array of skills and talents in state and private universities, and has encouraged the linking of research, education, and outreach activities to focus on problems of practical, economic, and social significance. NSGCP continues to provide opportunities for NOAA to develop cost-effective means for investigating marine issues where sharing resources—human​, facilities, and fiscal—advances the national interest. NSGCP is a major vehicle for NOAA to reach beyond its own corporate laboratories and to use the nation's expertise in marine science, engineering, policy, and education for the national good. The Ocean Studies Board was requested to review NSGCP as part of the preparations for the upcoming reauthorization hearings to be held in 1994 and 1995. The many detailed responses received by the committee were greatly appreciated and showed the depth and breadth of interest, enthusiasm, and pro found concerns about and for NSGCP. This report summarizes those materials and makes a series of focused recommendations to specific individuals, including associated action dates. In this way, the committee believes it has given NOAA a plan that can be followed to ensure that the concerns and problems identi​fied are addressed before the reauthorization hearings."
