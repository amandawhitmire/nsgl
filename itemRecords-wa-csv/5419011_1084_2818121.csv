9,Abstract:,"The perception of high incidences of accidents related to open ocean recreational activities in Hawaii and the need for developing educational programs on water safety for resident and non-resident users of coastal sites and facilities first motivated this research. The cost of insurance, number of suits, and contributory aspects of negligence were important in designing the total scope of this risk management study on open-water operations of Hawaii hotels. Discussion is limited to the statistics compiled as frequency of occurrence, characterizing personnel training and certification standards, inservice training programs, client education programs and procedures, insurance coverage, litigation, and hazard warning devices used by the hotels. Standardization of risk management procedures, including hazard warning devices, will enable the industry to self-police its own operations. Unless small operations resort to pooling or other forms of non-traditional cooperative insurance programs, they lack the financial base to obtain the best coverage at least cost; hence, unless they explore other options, it is likely that their insurance costs will continue to escalate."
