19,Abstract:,"The Anthropocene has brought substantial change to ocean ecosystems, but whetherthis age will bring more or less marine disease is unknown. In recent years, the acceleratingtem​po of epizootic and zoonotic disease events has made it seem as ifdisease is on the rise. Is this apparent increase in disease due to increased observationand sampling effort, or to an actual rise in the abundance of parasites and pathogens?We examined the literature to track long-term change in the abundance of twoparasitic nematode genera with zoonotic potential: Anisakis spp. and Pseudoterranova​spp. These anisakid nematodes cause the disease anisakidosis and are transmittedto humans in undercooked and raw marine seafood. A total of 123 papers publishedbetwee​n 1967 and 2017 met our criteria for inclusion, from which we extracted 755host–parasit​e–location–year​ combinations. Of these, 69.7% concerned Anisakis spp.and 30.3% focused on Pseudoterranova spp. Meta-regression revealed an increasein Anisakis spp. abundance (average number of worms/fish) over a 53 year periodfrom 1962 to 2015 and no significant change in Pseudoterranova spp. abundanceover a 37 year period from 1978 to 2015. Standardizing changes to the period of1978–2015, so that results are comparable between genera, we detected a significant283-​fold increase in Anisakis spp. abundance and no change in the abundance ofPseudoterrano​va spp. This increase in Anisakis spp. abundance may have implicationsfor human health, marine mammal health, and fisheries profitability."
