9,Abstract:,"The urgent need to increase knowledge about estuarine restoration has led representatives of Restore America's Estuaries (RAE) and the Estuarine Research Federation (ERF) to form a partnership to address it. RAE is a coalition of 11 regional community-based organizations that works to preserve estuaries across America. Collectively the RAE organizations, working with others, have restored over 25,000 acres of estuary habitat. ERF is a national organization of research scientists dedicated to promoting research on estuaries and the coastal environment. Over the past year RAE and ERF sponsored a series of workshops. As the centerpiece for this initial year of collaboration, a set of working principles was developed to guide restoration activities. This report highlights the results of Year One of the RAI-ERF collaboration. The booklet assesses the current situation, outlines the restoration principles, proposes a future agenda, and provides six case studies of restoration projects."
