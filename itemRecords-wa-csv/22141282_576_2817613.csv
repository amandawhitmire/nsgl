13,Abstract:,"Ecology has made extensive use of oblique aerial photography to assist in the characterizatio​n and management of our shorelines for the last 40 years. This report documents the history of obtaining these images and summarizes Ecology’s 2015-2017 project which reassessed methods for both acquiring photos and for making them readily accessible.. Background: Reducing the cumulative and secondary impacts of growth on Washington’s shorelines is a high priority for Ecology’s Shorelands and Environmental Assistance Program (SEA). This requires tools that help monitor development activities and environmental changes. Washington has 28,000 miles of marine and freshwater shoreline, much of it difficult to observe because of challenging terrain, private property, and limited access points. In addition, most development consists of small-scale projects dispersed across a complex landscape. Documenting modest, but widespread, modifications such as bulkheads, docks and piers, and changes in riparian vegetation is impossible without high quality aerial imagery collected at relatively frequent intervals."
