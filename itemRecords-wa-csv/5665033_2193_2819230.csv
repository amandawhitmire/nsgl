10,Abstract:,"Reducing bycatch and waste has become a celebrated cause in marine conservation and a dominant issue in fisheries around the world. Research and policy initiatives on the topic have proliferated as fisheries agencies, scientists, institutes, and fishermen seek ways to deal with bycatch and its newfound retinue of political consequences. The new urgency over bycatch arises from the same trend that underlies most environmental strife today: the rapid growth in human population and technological powers. We now have the appetite and the tools to empty the ocean's larder of many species faster than they can replace themselves, leading to unpredictable chains of consequences, both ecological and social. This handbook provides an overview of the bycatch problem in U.S. fisheries today and suggests ways fishermen, conservationistâ€‹s, scientists and policy makers can work together toward a solution."
