10,Abstract:,"This guide provides interesting and potentially life- saving information about the occurrence in Washington state of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), a sometimes fatal illness that has been occurring for hundreds of years. Tingling of the mouth within minutes or hours of eating shellfish is an early symptom of PSP and calls for immediate medical attention. Induce vomiting, give a brisk laxative, and prepare to administer artificial respiration for many hours. Readers will learn much more about the organism that creates the poison, how and which shellfish accumulate it, and what health departments do to protect the public from unsafe shellfish harvesting. This important brochure dispels several myths about detecting and eliminating the toxin."
