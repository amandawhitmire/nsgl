10,Abstract:,"Marine reserves are being increasingly used to protect exploited marine species. However, blanket protection of species within a reserve may shelter nonindigenous species that are normally affected by harvesting, intensifying their impacts on native species. The author has studied a system of marine reserves in the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA, to examine the extent to which marine reserves are invaded by nonindigenous species and the consequences of these invasions on native species. The author surveyed three reserves and eight non-reserves to quantify the abundance of intertidal suspension-​feeding clam species, three of which are regionally widespread nonindigenous species (""Nuttallia obscurata,"" ""Mya arenaria,"" and ""Venerupis philippinarum"")​. Neither total nonindigenous nor native species' abundance was significantly greater on reserves. However, the most heavily harvested species, ""V. philippinarum,"" was significantly more abundant on reserves, with the three reserves ranking highest in ""Venerupis"" biomass of all 11 sites. In contrast, a similar, harvested native species (""Protothaca staminea"") did not differ between reserves and non-reserves. The author followed these surveys with a year-long field experiment replicated at six sites (the three reserves and three of the surveyed non-reserve sites). The experiment examined the effects of high ""Venerupis"" densities on mortality, growth, and fecundity of the confamilial ""Protothaca,"" and whether differences in predator abundance mitigate density-​dependent effects. Even at densities 50% higher than measured in the field survey, ""Venerupis"" had no direct effect on itself or ""Prorothaca""; only site, predator exposure, and their interaction had significant effects. Analyses incorporating environmental variables tracked at each site indicated that crab biomass most heavily influenced clam responses, causing lower growth of both species and higher mortality of ""Venerupis,"" whose annualized loss rate was 50% when exposed to predators. A laboratory prey choice experiment indicated that ""Cancer productus,"" an influential intertidal crab predator, favored small adult ""Venerupis"" at least 1.7 times over ""Protothaca"". ""Venerupis'"" high susceptibility to excavating crab and human predators, as well as its faster growth compared to ""Protothaca"" can be explained by its shallower burial depth. By growing quickly and residing near the surface, ""Venerupis"" apparently absorbs the brunt of harvest pressure while ""Protothaca"" maintains high biomass even outside of reserves."
