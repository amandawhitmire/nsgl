10,Abstract:,"This paper analyzes the evolution of rural nonpoint source pollution management in Puget Sound from 1980-1990. The biogeophysical nature of nonpoint source pollution indicates that effective nonpoint source management requires the cooperation of a large number of individual land owners, each of whom is contributing a small amount to the total pollution problem. The necessity for group action to achieve management goals gives nonpoint source management the characteristics of a public good. Consideration of the institutional arrangements that determined the management of this public good problem leads to important inferences as to how and why programs evolved. Moreover, the effectiveness of the different decision making and management structures that have addressed various aspects of the problem at different institutional levels can be assessed."
