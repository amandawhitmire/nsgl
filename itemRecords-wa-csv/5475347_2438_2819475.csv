10,Abstract:,"In this study, salmonid fishes injected with mixtures consisting of wild ""Vibrio anguillarum"" and a siderophore-​deficient, receptor-​proficient mutant resulted in recovery of both the wild type and the mutant strain, while in infections with mixtures consisting of the wild-type strain and a siderophore-​deficient, receptor-​deficient mutant only the wild-type strain could be recovered. These results suggest that the ""V. anguillarum"" plasmid-​mediated siderophore is produced in-vivo in a diffusible form and that it is an important factor of virulence. The availability of iron for growth has been implicated as an important virulence factor in a number of systems. Bacteria capable of causing disseminated infections frequently produce siderophores which are capable of binding iron with very high affinity and delivering this iron to the bacterium to satisfy its nutritional needs. However, there have been very few studies showing that a siderophore is actually produced in the animal host and thereby may influence the outcome of an infection."
