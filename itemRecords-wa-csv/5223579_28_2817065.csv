9,Abstract:,"The Washington Sea Grant Program is now beginning its eleventh year. Like other Sea Grant programs throughout the country, its primary concern is the wise use and protection of our valuable marine resources through coordinated efforts in research and development, education and training, advisory services, and communication. This report documents these efforts for the period January 1, 1976 through December 31, 1978. The report is by no means an exhaustive picture of all the activities, projects or accomplishments but rather an overview, a distillation as it were, of the program."
