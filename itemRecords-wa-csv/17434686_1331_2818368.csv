11,Abstract:,"Laminaria is a genus of brown seaweed that is of great importance to a variety of industries and is also a staple in the diet of many Oriental countries . The history of harvesting this kelp species goes back many hundreds of years . During the last 50 years or so, efforts to cultivate this plant on artificial substrata have made significant gains in China and Japan. There are no commercial, open-water Laminaria farms in North America at present . However, small-​scale efforts at cultivation of red seaweed species for food have been reported in British Columbia (Mumford & Melvin 1983) and in Washington State (Waaland 1983) . Neushul and his co-workers have described attempts at openwater cultivation of Macrocystis pyrifera and several red species, including Gelidium and Eucheuma (Fei 1983 ; Neushul et al. 1982) . Recent efforts to establish an edible kelp cultivation technology for Laminaria sp. in British Columbia have been reported by Druehl (1980x, b ; 1981) . The Marine Biomass Program in New York has been cultivating the various life stages of Laminaria saccharine both in a greenhouse and on small, submerged platforms in Long Island Sound since 1980 (Brinkhuis & Hanisak 1982) . This paper describes some of the experiments that have been conducted on growth characteristics of this species as its southern limit of distribution in the western North Atlantic. The research has led to the development of a small rope farm that wi11 be deployed in the summer of 1983 and seeded with juvenile sporophytes in early fall ."
