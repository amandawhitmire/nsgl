14,Abstract:,"During the spring of each of 3 years, 1977, l978, and 1979, tagging cruises directed toward lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) were conducted in the vicinity of the southern end of San Juan Island. These efforts are to estimate mortality rates and other biological parameters, as part. of a long-term study of the population dynamics of lingcod in northern Puget Sound. The present report presents the preliminary results of the cruises, detailing times, areas, dates, and methods of capture; tag numbers and types; and length and sex determinations ~ Additionally, the returns to date are summarized."
