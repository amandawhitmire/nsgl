13,Abstract:,"To help make students aware of the treasures of the sea found in our earliest literature, we have compiled and edited this international collection of fairy and folk tales which use the sea as a central theme. We hope this collection will arouse the reader's interest in the ocean and its mysteries. This collection is the result of months of searches through hundreds of volumes. We have included tales from every inhabited continent so that American students can enjoy their varied heritage. Our search led us to Houston, Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. As far as we can determine, this collection represents the only volume of international fairy and folk tales exclusively about the earth's seas. The following stories are in this book: American: The Girl Fish; The Serpents. Eskimo: A Nenets Tale; The Story of Nuliajuk, Mother of the Sea, Ruler of all Beasts, the Most Dangerous and Terrible of all Spirits, to whom Nothing is Impossible; The Sea Lion Hunt; The House of the Sea Lions; The Polar Bear; The Lake Monster; The Young Man Helps. North American Indian: The Woman Stolen by Killer-Whales; the Empounded Water. Australian: A Fish Story. African: The Serpent's Bride; The Marriage of the Rain; The Golden-Headed Fish. Asian: The Flying Ship; Why the Ocean is Salty; The Sea of Gold. European: Cossack-The Story of Tremsin, the Bird Zhar, and Nastasia, the Lovely Maid of the Sea; Russian- The Raven and the Lobster; Salt; German-The Fisherman and His Wife; Scandinavian- The Little Mermaid; The Troll's Daughter; and Why the Sea is Salt."
