12,Abstract:,"Thermal shock can disrupt meiosis II in fish oocytes, producing embryos with an extra set of maternal chromosomes from the second polar body; such shocks have been used to induce diploid gynogenesis or triploidy with varied success in different salmonid species. This study investigated the effect of thermal shocks on the success of inducing diploid gynogenesis in chinook salmon (""Oncorhynchus tshawytscha"") oocytes. Different times of initiation resulted in similar survival. A treatment duration of 20 min resulted in significantly higher gynogen survival to hatch compared to 5 or 15 min, and a 10-min duration resulted in the lowest mean survival. The effect of temperature on induced retention of the second polar body is unclear due to varied results dependent on the maternal egg source; however, the mean survival to hatch for 25 deg. C treatment groups was significantly higher than the mean of 29 deg. C groups."
