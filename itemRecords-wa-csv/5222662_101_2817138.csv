10,Abstract:,"In 1971, the University of Washington was designated as a Sea Grant College by the U. S. Department of Commerce with grants administered by the Division of Marine Resources at the University. One of these grants, ""Aquatic Stock Management,"" under No. 1-35320, was established to promote innovative teaching related to management of renewable resources, and to supplement and broaden instructions being given at the College of Fisheries and in the Quantitative Science Center. To help satisfy these objectives, Mr. John Gulland, Chief of Fishery Statistics and Economic Data Branch, Fisheries Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, was invited to present a series of lectures on the application of population dynamics to world fisheries. The fifteen lectures delivered by Mr. Gulland in the fall of 1971 are presented in this book. The purpose of this series is threefold: first, to describe some of the major world fisheries especially those outside the Northeast Pacific; second, to review some of the techniques used in fish population dynamics; and third (and most important), to see how the theory of fish population dynamics can be applied to real fisheries."
