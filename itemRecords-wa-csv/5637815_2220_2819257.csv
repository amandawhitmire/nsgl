12,Abstract:,"The osmoregulatory capacity of triploid chum X chinook salmon, a successful hybrid with potential for early sea-water tolerance, is assessed. These hybrids have some genetic similarities to both parents and had early sea-water tolerance similar to chum salmon controls. The use of sterile triploids and triploid hybrids for the aquaculture of anadromous species may provide fish with valuable production characteristics as well as aid in the conservation of wild stocks by eliminating introgression that can result from hatchery and farmed-fish strays."
