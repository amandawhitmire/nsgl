20,Abstract:,"Since the end of World War II, exploration and mapping of the ocean basins has intensified and has become increasingly sophisticated. The rapidly developing technologies of swath mapping, seismic profiling, and global positioning systems will soon provide an unparalleled capacity for spatial resolution of features on and beneath the ocean floor over a broad spectrum of scales. Recent discoveries indicate that many fundamental geological, chemical and biological processes are concentrated within a relatively narrow band centered on the oceanic rift zones or spreading centers. With a philosophy akin to that which underlay the establishment of magnetic, astronomical and volcano observatories, it is feasible for the oceanographic community to initiate a major international program leading to the installation of one or more permanent `observatories' on the floor of the ocean. The goal of this program would be to document and model changes in related processes occurring at an active ridge crest over a time span during which those processes show significant variation."
