14,Abstract:,"This document was developed to provide shoreline planners and managers with a summary of current science and management recommendations to inform protection of ecological functions of marine riparian areas. This information contained in this report will help inform local decisions regarding what is needed to protect ecological functions of marine riparian areas. Specifically, we summarize the range of marine riparian buffer widths (Appendix G) needed to meet particular levels of ecosystem function based on a literature review and input from an expert panel workshop."
