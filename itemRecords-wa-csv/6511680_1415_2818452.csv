20,Abstract:,"The PS-AHAB (Puget Sound Alexandrium Harmful Algal Bloom) program, funded by NOAA/ECOHAB, seeks to understand environmental controls on the benthic (cyst) and planktonic life stages of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, and evaluate the effects of climate change on the timing and location of blooms. This includes detailed mapping of overwintering cysts at 99 stations throughout Puget Sound. Highest surface sediment cyst abundances in 2011 and 2012 were found in Bellingham Bay (north), in bays on the western side of the central main basin and in Quartermaster Harbor (south). While cyst distribution patterns were similar for both years, 2012 cyst abundances were a factor of two lower at most stations. Compared to a 2005 survey, the Bellingham Bay ""seed bed"" is new, whereas Quartermaster Harbor cyst concentrations have decreased by an order of magnitude. In a related study funded by Washington Sea Grant, cysts from surface sediments at thirty 2012 PS-AHAB stations were evaluated for their germination potential with results ranging from 16% to 66% viability. To date, no relationship between cyst viability and cyst appearance has been detected. These results will be used to inform a model to explore the possibility of providing seasonal Alexandrium catenella bloom forecasts."
