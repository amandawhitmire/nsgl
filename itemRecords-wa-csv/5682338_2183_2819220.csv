11,Abstract:,"While steaming with the current along a deep tidal channel, oceanographers had the good fortune to sample a kilometer-long set of large billows. As the billows faded on the echo sounder, attempts were made to reposition the ship for a second sampling. The current cooperated, allowing researchers to collect a second set of measurements. This paper is a detailed presentation of that fortuitous encounter. Simultaneous measurements of microstructure, acoustic backscatter, and horizontal currents provide a unique realization of energetic, naturally occurring billows."
