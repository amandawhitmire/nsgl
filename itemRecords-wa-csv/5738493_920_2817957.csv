10,Abstract:,"Two sites off the northern Washington coast, immediately south of an experimental over-fishing area, were monitored intensively during 1968-70. The principal objective of this study was to resurvey them in 1992 and evaluate the impact of intensive rockfish fishing in adjacent Canadian waters. The 1992 survey also provided an opportunity to see how well abundance trends in the index sites off northern Washington reflected overall changes in the abundance of Pacific ocean perch in the U.S. Vancouver and Columbia management areas, and to examine long-term changes in age composition, size at maturity, and growth at the index sites."
