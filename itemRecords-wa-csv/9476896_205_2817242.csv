11,Abstract:,"The PSP Ecosystem Coordination Board (ECB) created a subcommittee to evaluate regulatory issues associated with shoreline armoring in January 2013. The ECB directed the subcommittee to evaluate the effectiveness of Open Space Taxation Act policies and other tax-based incentives for shoreline process improvement. PSP contracted with Washington Sea Grant to prepare a report addressing tax incentives based upon recommendations from the subcommittee. This final report contains an example of how the current use program has been applied to a shoreline property in Mason County, a county without a Public Benefit Rating System. This is used to demonstrate the opportunities and barriers that may exist to implementing the program for purposes of creating an incentive for residential shoreline homeowners to either refrain from installing or remove bulkheads or other armoring on their property. The report identifies opportunities to modify this program and analyzes whether a guidance document would better target shoreline protection. Two examples of county-specific programs, in King and Whatcom counties, have been evaluated to determine barriers to implementation and potential opportunities for modifications in order to use the program as an incentive for residential shoreline homeowners to either refrain from installing or remove bulkheads or armoring on their property. The report identifies opportunities to modify county-specific Public Benefit Rating Systems and provides draft language for further discussion. Finally, the report includes a brief review of additional incentives that could be “bundled” with the tax incentive to ensure the properties enrolled permanently restrict bulkheads on site. Also, the tax incentive may not provide sufficient financial motivations for property owners. The report identifies additional financial incentives that could be provided along with the tax incentive."
