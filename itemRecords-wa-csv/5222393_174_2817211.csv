10,Abstract:,"During the 1970 special session of the Washington Legislature, a seacoast management act was presented, debated, and altered. Although this bill failed to clear both houses of the legislature, similar bills have been presented to the 1971 regular session, Because a background of the dispute about the 1970 Seacoast Management Act may be of value to future policy makers, this paper will analyze the ma]or events leading to that dispute."
