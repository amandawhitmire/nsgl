11,Abstract:,"An overview of disease resistance response at the protein or mRNA level substantiates the hypothesis that the number of genes ""associated"" with disease resistance response is quite large. The authors propose that it would be useful to identify genes whose activation most closely corresponds with resistance events during infection and investigate their regulatory properties. The expression of host responses can be evaluated using either living fungal spores as inoculum or chitosan, a minor component of the ""Fusarium"" cell wall. In this paper the authors describe the use of 9 pea clones to follow the accumulation and synthesis of mRNA species during the pea's resistance response to ""F. solani"" f. sp.""phaseoli"", and its susceptible response to ""F. solani"" f. sp. ""pisi"", and to chitosan."
