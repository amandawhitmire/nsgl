11,Abstract:,"Subseafloor environments created by the mixing of hot hydrothermal fluids and seawater are predicted to be particularly energy-rich, and hyperthermophil​ic microoganisms that broadly reflect such predictions are ejected from these systems in low-​temperature, basalt- hosted diffuse effluents. Seven hyperthermophil​ic heterotrophs isolated from low-temperature diffuse fluids exiting the basaltic crust in and near two hydrothermal vent fields on the Endeavour Segment, Juan de Fuca Ridge, were compared phylogeneticall​y and physiologically to six similarly enriched hyperthermophil​es from samples associated with seafloor metal sulfide structures. The phylogenetic relationships between the two groups of organisms indicate that the subseafloor habitat differs significantly from that within the sulfide structures. Hypotheses regarding the habitat differences were generated through comparison of the physiology of the two groups of hyperthermophil​es; some potential differences between these habitats include fluid flow stability, metal ion concentrations, and sources of complex organic matter."
