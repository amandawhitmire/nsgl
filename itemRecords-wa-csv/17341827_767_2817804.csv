16,Abstract:,"Climate change is occurring and is shifting regional climate and weather patterns. Despite the ongoing scientific consensus on the scope and scale of climate change impacts at the global and national level, projected regional effects have not received a comparable degree of research attention. This report focuses on preparing for the impacts of climate change exclusively on the North Olympic Peninsula of Washington State, the region defined for the purposes of this project by the flow of water from the Olympic Mountains north to the Strait of Juan de Fuca and northeastward to Puget Sound and Hood Canal. Much of the climate of the Pacific Northwest is determined by the interface of the North Pacific Ocean and mountainous western North America. The climate of the Olympic Peninsula is, in many ways, the epitome of that interface, with wetter western coastlines, heavy precipitation in the coastal Olympic Mountains, more mild interior waterways and lowlands, and drier areas in the eastern rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains. This project represents the collaborative effort of the more than 175 people who attended in-person workshops, participated in online webinars and conference calls, and reviewed written outputs of this project. Their participation is directly responsible for the success of this plan and will continue to be central to this ongoing effort to build climate change resilience for the North Olympic Peninsula."
