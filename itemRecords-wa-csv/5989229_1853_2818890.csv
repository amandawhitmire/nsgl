13,Abstract:,"Bacterial diseases are a major cause of larval mortality in shellfish hatcheries. Even with proper sanitation measures, bacterial pathogens cannot be eliminated in all cases. The pathogenicity of bacteria isolated from Pacific Northwest shellfish hatcheries to Pacific oyster ""Crassostrea gigas"" larvae was investigated. The authors found 3 highly pathogenic strains and 1 mildly pathogenic strain among 33 isolates tested. These strains appear to be members of the genus ""Vibrio"". Although there have been many studies of bivalve bacterial pathogens, a standard method to assess bacterial pathogenicity in bivalve larvae is needed. Thus, the authors developed two methods using either 15 ml conical tubes or tissue culture plates that were employed for rapidly screening bacterial strains for pathogenicity to Pacific oyster larvae. The tissue culture plates worked well for screening both mildly pathogenic strains and LD(50)(lethal doses) assays. This method allowed for non- intrusive and non-destructive observation of the oyster larvae with a dissecting microscope. The LD(50) for the three highly pathogenic strains ranged between 1.6 and 3.6 x 1004 colony forming units (CFU) ml^-1 after 24 h and between 3.2 x 10^2 and 1.9 x 10^3CFU ml^-1 after 48h."
