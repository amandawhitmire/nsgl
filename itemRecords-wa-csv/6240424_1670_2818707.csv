10,Abstract:,"Shellfish are a keystone species, studied by water quality investigators to determine the health of a water body. Clams, oysters, mussels and other bivalves filter seawater and, in the process, can accumulate environmental contaminants in their tissues. Polluted shellfish beds are often an early warning to a larger problem, upland in the watershed, that needs immediate attention. Marine water quality standards are more stringent for shellfish harvesting than for wading and swimming. Since shellfish are a food, the threshold for contamination is much lower than for external contact with marine waters."
