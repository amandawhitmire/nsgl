Seventeen regional social scientists from public agencies, universities and consulting firms participated to: 1) Compile existing social research and monitoring related to Puget Sound recovery 2) Identify social research and monitoring gaps in Puget Sound recovery Existing research and monitoring as well as important gaps were identified across the fields of governance, economic, psychological, physical, social, and cultural wellbeing as well as human behaviors and infrastructural impacts (Appendices I-IV). Overarching themes related to conducting and incorporating social science into recovery planning were also identified."
