12,Abstract:,"The parr to smolt transformation in salmonids is a crucial period that includes profound morphological as well as physiological changes that prepare the juvenile fish for downstream migration and entry into seawater. The control of this process has been the focus of investigation for many years. Though some suggestions regarding the role of insulin during smoltification have been made, there has been no appropriate measurement of circulating levels of insulin in parr or smolts in fresh water because mammalian insulin radioimmunoassaâ€‹ys (RIA) in fish do not provide quantitative information about insulin levels in plasma. Following the isolation of coho salmon insulin in 1985, the authors developed a fully homologous RIA for measuring this hormone in salmon blood. Reported here are profiles of insulin throughout smoltification of coho salmon during successive years."
