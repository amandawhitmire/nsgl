10,Abstract:,"Significant deposits of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crust are found in the Exclusive Economic Zones of many Pacific nations. These deposits present a significant mineral potential, given the appropriate mining technology. The potential for mining cobalt- rich crusts on seamounts by a novel method is being assessed. This method adapts terrestrial ""in situ"" leach mining methods to the deep ocean floor, which if proved workable would considerably reduce the environmental damage projected from the mining of crusts by mechanical systems. Also, the innovative and low-cost technology of solution mining may favorably alter the economic equation leading to more timely commercial marine mining ventures."
