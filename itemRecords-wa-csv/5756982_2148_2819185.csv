12,Abstract:,"An automated control system has been installed and utilized to manage closed, recirculating seawater systems and associated filtration. The control system monitored pH, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, water flow rates, water line pressure and water levels. These inputs are used to control water addition, pump speed, chillers and heaters, aeration, photoperiod and buffer addition. An automated denitrifying biofilter was installed on the raceway and monitored water flow rate, ORP, temperature and pH. The aquaculture tanks and filtration systems and all variables were displayed graphically on computer monitors so that the control state of the systems could be quickly determined visually. Initial results indicate that the system is efficient and requires low initial intallation costs (US $18,000) and low operating costs."
