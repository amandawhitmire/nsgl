11,Abstract:,"Pituitary preparations alone or in combination with gonadotropin-​releasing hormone (GnRH) and its analogues have increasingly been used for advancing ovulation in salmonids. The authors have sought here to establish the minimal effective dosage (i.e., the most cost efficient procedure) for hormonal induction of ovulation in salmon. In addition, the study aimed to evaluate another effect of gonadotropin-​GnRHa treatment on ovarian function (steroidogenesi​s) aside from its action on ovulation in two salmonid species. A further objective was to characterize, at least in part, the endocrine patterns during the period of hormonal induction by measuring plasma sex steroids following the hormonal treatments used in these tests."
