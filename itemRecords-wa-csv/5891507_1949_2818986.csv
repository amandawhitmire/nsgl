10,Abstract:,"This article provides some background and up-to-date information about the ""Lost City,"" located 15 km off the Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis at the intersection of MAR and the Atlantic Transform Fault. Entirely distinct in structure and chemistry from the now-famous black smoker vents, the unique brand of hydrothermal circulation at the Lost City vents may have important effects on global ocean chemistry and provide new insights into early life on earth."
