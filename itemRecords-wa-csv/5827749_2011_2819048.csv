10,Abstract:,"This article looks at the tools used by state coastal zone management (CZM) programs to protect natural beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shores and examines the effectiveness of these management tools in achieving national policy objectives. Coastal and federal agencies are not routinely collecting the types of outcome data that were identified as valuable in measuring on-the-ground results in achieving national resource protection objectives. This article presents the context for management, including the extent and importance of the resource and the impacts that threaten it. Process indicators of effectiveness, which states use in varying ways to shape their management approach, are set forth. Upgrades to management tools adopted by the states are discussed; outcome indicators of effectiveness, including case examples that illustrate how data are collected to show on-the-ground results of CZM programs, are described."
