8,Abstract:,"This analysis demonstrates the feasibility of a transition path to sustainable salmon management. The advancement of restoration of depleted wild salmon stocks in the Northwestern United States with the re-introduction of in- river fixed gear techniques such as fishwheels is discussed. A dynamic simulation model demonstrates that fishwheels could reduce costs and increase net economic benefits to commercial fishers by a factor of five, and that potentially adverse income and employment consequences can be avoided with appropriate and sequenced policy implementation. In addition, the reintroduction of fishwheels could help mitigate recent conflicts between the United States and Canada over salmon harvest allocations."
