10,Abstract:,"Today, a major management challenge for any viable port is prioritizing goals and maintaining a policy that ensures clear focus on the highest priority goals. Prioritizing is crucial for long-term viability. Prioritizing of capital projects should be high on the list of any public port authority. This paper provides an overview of the decision-making processes used by public port authorities in evaluating new capital projects and insight into processes for determining the desirability of expanding, contracting, or terminating present facilities/serv​ices."
