9,Abstract:,"The introduction of non-native species through ballast water transportation is an issue of worldwide concern, with no definitive solution to date. Ozone has many qualities that could lend an alternative to the ballast water treatment debate. The technology has been in use for drinking water disinfection for decades and would be effective in fresh and salt water. An ozone system was installed on an oil tanker to allow for full-scale study of the effectiveness of using ozone as a ballast water treatment. Additional smaller scale studies were done with an ozone generator in the lab on compounds and source waters from various regions. An important aspect to the acceptance of a ballast water treatment technology is the ability of verification by a neutral third party. Ozonation would have an effect upon the fluorescence of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to study the effects of ozonation on known compounds, natural source waters and ballast water were examined using fluorescence spectroscopy. Three- dimension excitation emission matrixes were created for different stages of ozonation to compare before and after ozonation spectra in the hopes that 3D-CD0M spectra would be quantitatively different. Based on the data gathered in this study it is doubtful that CDOM can be used to verify ballast water treatment due to variability of CDOM in water sources."
