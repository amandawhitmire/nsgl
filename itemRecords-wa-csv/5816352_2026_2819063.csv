13,Abstract:,"Between 1993-94 there was an unexplained disappearance of approximately 110K tons of spawning herring in Prince William Sound (PWS). An emergency project found that VHS, a viral disease previously unreported from Pacific herring was present in some surviving herring. In 1994 VHS virus was present in less than 6% of the fish examined; however the prevalence of ""Ichthyophonus hoferi"", a fungal pathogen of fish, increases from 5% to 29%. Consequently, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game initiated a second study to include field surveys in PWS, controlled experimental studies, and physiological studies. This report presents the results of seven studies conducted in 1997 on topics such as virus survival in seawater, effects of oil exposure on immunity, net pen effects on disease, antibody production, and the development of age-related natural resistance and acquired immunity to VHS virus in Pacific herring."
