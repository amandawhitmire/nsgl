9,Abstract:,"Rivers are responsible for most sediment delivery to the ocean, and at the river-ocean transition,a complex set of processes and pathways shape the ultimate fate of particulates.Co​nceptual and numerical models of fluvial-marine dispersal have become increasingly sophisticatedth​rough several decades of observational and modeling studies. However, manykey processes remain poorly constrained, such as particle clearance from river plumes andepisodic sediment-​gravity flows, and connections between these types of discrete processes tosubaqueous-​delta evolution. This study investigates sediment-​dispersal processes and theirproducts in two deltaic systems: the small mountainous Elwha River delta (WashingtonStat​e), and the large Mekong River delta (Vietnam)."
