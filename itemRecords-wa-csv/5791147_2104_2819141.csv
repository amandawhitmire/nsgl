13,Abstract:,"Crab larvae cannot survive to metamorphosis on diets consisting solely of algae, protists, and non-living particles, but they do consume them in a wide range of sizes. Furthermore, natural densities of microcrustacean and other small animal prey often are lower than those required to sustain crab larvae in the laboratory. To evaluate the success of several omnivorous diets, the authors tested the nutritional value of various naturally occurring protists, and of seagrass detritus on the first larval stage of the intertidal shore crab ""Hemigrapsus oregonensis,"" raised in the laboratory."
