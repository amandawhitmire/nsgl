15,Abstract:,"Recently, Kawauchi and colleagues have isolated and characterized two salmon gonadotropins, GTH I and GTH II, that are homologous to tetrapod luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone. GTH II is almost identical in primary structure to maturational GTH previously isolated, whereas GTH I has not previously been studied. This study was designed to obtain basic endocrine information on GTH I and GTH II in juvenile coho salmon, ""Oncorhynchus kisutch""."
