8,Abstract:,"Farm-raised rainbow trout were evaluated by sensory and instrumental analysis to determine differences in flesh color. A wide range of pigment levels matched a single color tile. On the other hand, colorimeter values produced unique concentration values for each sample. A predictive model based on colorimeter readings was created as a rapid, easy- to-use field test for determining flesh color pigmentation levels for selective breeding programs."
