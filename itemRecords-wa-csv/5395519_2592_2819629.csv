8,Abstract:,"In terms of penetration, sound is to water what light is to air; this property has been well recognized in navigation and undersea warfare, but fisheries scientists have been slow to adopt hydroacoustics. However, as a consequence of recent research which led to better understanding of the acoustic scattering properties of fish, major expansion of the use of hydroacoustic techniques is currently taking place in fisheries research. The potential and limitations of these techniques are briefly discussed."
