10,Abstract:,Washington’s diverse and productive salt marshes and pocket estuaries already threatened by shoreline development and pollution now face a potentially destructive invader. The European green crab (Carcinus maenas) is considered one of the world’s worst invasive species. It can alter shoreline ecosystems and negatively impact economically important species. This fact sheet shows how to identify the green crab to help the public keep a watchful eye.
