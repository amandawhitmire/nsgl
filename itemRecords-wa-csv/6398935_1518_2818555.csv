13,Abstract:,"Whether you're visiting for the afternoon or kicking back on your dock, you know Pine Lake is a special place and a source of fond memories. Newer residents may be familiar with bright red crayfish and snails as big as golf balls. However, those who've lived on the lake for a while longer may remember a time without these fairly recent inhabitants. Researchers at the University of Washington have been studying the invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and Chinese mystery snail (Bellamya chinensis) in Pine Lake sinced 2006."
