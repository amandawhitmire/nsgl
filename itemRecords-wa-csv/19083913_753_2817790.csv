9,Abstract:,"The Palouse Prairie is a critically endangered ecosystem located in northern Idaho andeastern Washington. Its successful conservation will require an understanding of itsecological functioning to determine how best to restore function to degraded sites and thesocial value for conservation to understand the region’s priorities and preferences. Thisdissertatio​n explores the nuances of calculating the economic value of ecological quality insix chapters. The first chapter provides a brief history of the Palouse Prairie and providescontext for how it has arrived at its current degraded state. The second chapter assessesthe positive and negative effects of alternative methods for presenting ecological quality torespondents within a choice experiment survey; it evaluates the significance ofsociodemograp​hic variables on whether residents choose to conserve or not conservePalouse Prairie, and it compares the relative importance of the attributes on PalousePrairie conservation. Economic value for Palouse Prairie conservation was determinedbased on a choice experiment that includes the attributes of size, ecological quality, thegiant Palouse earthworm, rare plants, public access, and cost. The third chapter evaluatesthe interaction between sense of place and economic value. It considers perspectives onwhether or not it is appropriate to use a monetary value to inform conservation decisionsand it evaluates the importance, qualitatively, of the Palouse Prairie to residents and theirfamilies. The fourth chapter uses economic values from the choice experiment andgenerates a composite measure of ecological quality using factor analysis to assign anindirect willingness to pay for individual measures of ecological quality. The fifth chapterevaluate​s the importance of culturally significant plants on the Palouse Prairie through anivalternative valuation methodology based on semi-structured interviews and a generalpopulati​on survey which focuses on the perspectives of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. The final chapter summarizes the significance of the work andprovides an overview of how the results can be integrated into policy. An Interdisciplina​ryapproach was central to the development, analysis, and interpretation of this research."
