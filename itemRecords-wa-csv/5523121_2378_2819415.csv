13,Abstract:,"It is well documented that dietary fatty acid composition has a profound effect on reproductive performance in farmed fish. Juvenile and post-juvenile salmonids have been shown to thrive on diets containing a variety of lipid sources other than fish oil, provided that the diet contains a sufficient level of ""n""-3 fatty acids. In one study beef tallow was substituted for a portion of the fish oil in diets of maturing rainbow trout; the beef tallow diet influenced the fatty acid composition of the eggs, but no difference in egg viability was found. This study was conducted to determine the effects of feeding diets sufficient in essential fatty acids, at the same time containing alternate plant and animal lipid sources, on tissue and egg fatty acid composition and reproductive performance of coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"")."
