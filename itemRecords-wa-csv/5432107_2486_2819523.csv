10,Abstract:,"The purpose of this report is to examine the change in thyroid response to a range of dosages of thyroid-​stimulating hormone (TSH) in juvenile salmon, and to evaluate whether changes in the minimal effective dose of TSH (sensitivity) may cause the blood plasma thyroxine elevation and its subsequent depression during smoltification."
