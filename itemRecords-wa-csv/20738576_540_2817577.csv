14,Abstract:,"Conservation for the Anthropocene Ocean: Interdisciplina​ry Science in Support of Nature and People emphasizes strategies to better connect the practice of marine conservation with the needs and priorities of a growing global human population. It conceptualizes nature and people as part of shared ecosystems, with interdisciplina​ry methodologies and science-based applications for coupled sustainability. A central challenge facing conservation is the development of practical means for addressing the interconnectedn​ess of ecosystem health and human well-being, advancing the fundamental interdisciplina​ry science that underlies conservation practice, and implementing this science in decisions to manage, preserve, and restore ocean ecosystems. To understand and protect the biodiversity of the ocean and ameliorate the negative impacts of ocean change on people, it is critical to understand human beliefs, values, behaviors, and impacts. Conversely, on a human-dominated planet, it is impossible to understand and address human well-being and chart a course for sustainable use of the oceans without understanding the implications of environmental change for human societies that depend on marine ecosystems and resources. This work therefore presents a timely, needed, and interdisciplina​ry approach to the conservation of our oceans. Key features in this book: *Helps marine conservation scientists and practitioners apply principles from oceanography, ecology, anthropology, economics, political science, and other natural and social sciences to manage and preserve marine ecosystems. *Facilitates understanding of how and why social and environmental processes are coupled in the quest to achieve healthy and sustainable oceans. *Uses a combination of expository material, practical approaches, and forward-looking theoretical discussion to enhance value for readers as they consider conservation research, management, and planning. Chapters include: 1. Bridging the science -- policy interface: adaptive solutions in the Anthropocene; 2. Climate variability, climate change, and conservation in a dynamic ocean; 3. The future species of Anthropocene Seas; 4. How can the oceans help feed 9 billion people?; 5. Social resilience in the Anthropocene ocean; 6. Principles of interdisciplina​ry conservation; 7 Creating space for community in marine conservation and management: mappying ""communities-​at-​sea""; 8. Conservation actions at global and local scales in marine social-​ecological systems: status, gaps, and ways forward; 9.Ocean cultures: northwest coast ecosystems and indigenous management systems; 10. Blurred lines: what's a non-native species in the Anthropocene Ocean?; 11. Can ecosystem services make conservation normal and commonpleace?; 12. Beyond privatization: rethinking fisheries stewardship and conservation in the North Pacific; 13. Addressing socioecological tipping points and safe operating spaces in the anthropocene; 14. Stakeholder participation in marine management: the importance of transparency and rules for participation; 15. Marine conservation as complex cooperative and competitive human interactions; 16. Transdisciplina​ry research for conservation and sustainable development planning in the Caribbean; 17. Social-​ecological trade-offs in Baltic Sea fisheries management; 18. Human rights and the sustainability of fisheries; 19. Implications of a changing climate for food sovereignty in coastal British Columbia; 20. The future of modeling to support conservation decisions in the Anthropocene Ocean; 21. The big role of coastal communities and small-scale fishers in ocean conservation; 22. Innovations in collaborative science: advancing citizen science, crowdsourcing and partipatory modeling to understand and manage marine social-​ecological systems; 23. Looking forward: interconnectedn​ess in the Anthropocene Ocean."
