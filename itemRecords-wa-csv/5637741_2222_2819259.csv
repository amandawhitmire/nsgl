13,Abstract:,"The ovarian structure of the shortspine thornyhead, ""Sebastolobus alascanus (Scorpaeniforme​s), which is similar to the ovarian structure previously described only for the pigmy lion fish, ""Dendrochirus brachypterus"" (Scorpaeniforme​s), is specialized for the production and expulsion of pelagic gelatinous egg masses. The ovarian descriptions clearly illustrate how ""S. alascanus"" produces and deposits the gelatinous egg mass, and provides evidence necessary for the enhancement of the reproductive evolutionary scenarios within the suborder Scorpaenoidea."
