22,Abstract:,"Increased recognition of the need for ecosystem-based management has resulted in a growing body of researchon the use of indicators to represent and track ecosystem status, particularly in marine environments. Whilemultiple frameworks have been developed for selecting and evaluating indicators, certain types of indicatorsrequi​re additional consideration and validation. In particular, an index, which we define as an aggregation oftwo or more indicators, may have unique properties and behaviors that can make interpretation difficult, particularlyin a management context. We assert that more rigorous validation and testing is required for indices,particu​larly those used to inform management decisions. To support this point we demonstrate the need forvalidation and then explore current development and validation processes for ecosystem indices. We alsocompare how other disciplines (e.g., medicine, economics) validate indices. Validating indices (and indicators) isparticularly challenging because they are often developed without an explicit objective in mind. We suggest thatexploring the sensitivity of an index to the assumptions made during its development be a pre-requisite toemploying such an index."
