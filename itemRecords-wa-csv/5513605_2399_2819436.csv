13,Abstract:,"The agencies responsible for power, water and fish management in the Columbia River Basin have embarked on a massive program to evaluate the potential for enhanced salmonid production. The importance of improving the effectiveness of hatcheries through the release of better-quality smolts has been emphasized. There is considerable evidence that changes in the ocean environment have a major influence in affecting changes in overall smolt to adult survival of salmonids throughout their range. In order to evaluate the effects of hatchery conditions, reflected through the sampling of smolt physiology, on subsequent survival one should be able to remove any effects of changes in ocean conditions on survival over the time period sampled. In this study, therefore, pilot studies were performed to identify key environmental variables which appear to correlate with marine survival of west coast salmonids."
