14,Abstract:,"Demersal fish populations were sampled on a quarterly basis in and around proposed dredge disposal sites as part of the Puget Sound Dredge Disposal Analysis study. Sampling was conducted at depths ranging from 15 to 140 m using a 7.6-m otter trawl. Two Zones of Siting Feasibility (ZSFs) were located in Nisqually Reach, one near Ketron Island and the other near Devils Head; and two ZSFs were located in Bellingham Bay (north and south). Catches of bottomfishes in the dispersive sites and adjacent areas were generally low. Only young walleye pollock were found in substantial abundance, and then only in the Strait of Juan de Fuca during autumn."
