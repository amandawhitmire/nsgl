13,Abstract:,"In most environments, more than 99% of the prokaryotic microorganisms (generically referred to as bacteria) observed under a microscope are unculturable, yet they represent considerable genetic diversity, as determined by molecular techniques. Given that most of earth's inhabitable environments are permanently cold [<20 degrees C; <5 degrees C in the volumetrically dominant ocean], a significant fraction of the unculturable microbial life is likely to be cold-adapted--uniquely evolved to exploit the resources present in their vast and chemically diverse aquatic and terrestrial environments. In fact, native consortia of cold-adapted bacteria often catalyze reactions at rates comparable to their mesophilic counterparts inhabiting warmer climes. Knowledge of the genetics and physiology of isolates in culture and biogeochemical information on native consortia in cold environments indicate that the probability of these diverse uncultured microorganisms expressing novel processes or products of biotechnological interest is high. This article provides a review and prospectus of molecular-genetic technologies, catalytic proteins or enzymes, and bioremediation strategies as they pertain to the biotechnological application of cold-adapted microorganisms. Although the terms ""psychrophilic"" (cold-loving) and ""psychrotolerant"" (cold-tolerant, also synonymous with ""psychrotrophic"") have been used in the microbiological literature for decades to describe varying degrees of cold adaptation, their specific meanings in research articles are often unclear or misunderstood. Here those microorganisms capable of growth at temperatures below 15 degrees C (the lower threshold for mesophiles) are referred to as ""cold-adapted."" Cold-adapted thus includes bacteria that require low temperatures (less than or equal to 15 degrees C) for optimum growth, originally defined by Morita as psychrophiles, and those that prefer warmer temperatures (usually> 20 degrees C) but can still grow slowly at temperatures as low as 0 degrees C, which are considered psychrotolerant. For catalytic proteins and their functions at low temperatures, we use the term ""cold-active,"" regardless of the thermal class of the enzyme-producing organism."
