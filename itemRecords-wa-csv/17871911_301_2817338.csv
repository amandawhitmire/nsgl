10,Abstract:,"With 3,067 miles of coastline and more than 45 coastal cities, Washington needs to prepare people, infrastructure, and fish and wildlife habitat for these hazards, which are forecast to worsen over time. As part of a national effort, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office for Coastal Management recently awarded almost $1 million to Washington Sea Grant for a three-year project to assist coastal communities in Washington State facing significant risk from the impacts of sea level rise, storm surge and shoreline erosion."
