9,Abstract:,"Whelk egg case precursor proteins are stockpiled in the nidamental gland of a gravid female whelk and assembled post-​fertilization into an impervious protective coating for the egg. 2. Egg case maturation is rapid and involves extensive chemical crosslinking. 3. Egg case material is quasi-elastic and completely reversible in tension, but relies primarily on nonentropic forces. 4. Fibers with the mechanical properties of whelk egg case can be electrospun from protein precursors."
