9,Abstract:,"The aggressive nature of homarid lobsters places constraints on the development of lobster rearing systems. Animals must be held in individual pens to eliminate losses due to injury and cannibalism. They also should be held in continuous darkness for maximal growth. We hypothesized that lobsters held in opaque, non-reflective containers would exhibit less activity and hence lower oxygen consumption rates than animals held in transparent or highly reflective containers. Tests showed that short-term mean oxygen consumption rates for lobsters separated by rubber-lined partitions were 8% lower than those of lobsters separated by clear partitions, and 29% lower than those of lobsters separated by mirrored partitions."
