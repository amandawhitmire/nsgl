7,Abstract:,"Anchovy, ""Engraulis mordax"", larvae were reared in the laboratory under a variety of food regimes and the triacylglycerolâ€‹, cholesterol, and polar lipid contents of individual larvae were measured as indicators of nutritional condition. The different food levels used produced a clear effect on the larvae for each of the three lipid components. A comparison with field-caught larvae showed that a `standard' laboratory rearing produced larvae with a lipid content much too high. To have a size-specific lipid content similar to the field individuals required that the food concentration be very much lower. The cholesterol and polar lipid contents exhibited a good straight-line relationship with the lipid-free weight of the larvae, as would be expected from indicators of larval tissue weight. Results revealed the lipid components to be very good indicators of the condition of the larvae."
