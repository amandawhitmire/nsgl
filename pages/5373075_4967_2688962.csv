9,Abstract:,"The marine natural product manoalide (MLD) was shown to directly inactivate bee venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Inactivation was pH-, time-, and concentration-​dependent. The time-dependent loss of PLA2 activity suggested that inactivation does not follow typical Michaelis-​Menten kinetics. Reversibility was studied directly by dilution and dialysis; both methods were ineffective in dissociating the MLD-PLA2 complex. A kinetic study supports our hypothesis that MLD inactivates bee venom PLA2 by an irreversible mechanism."
