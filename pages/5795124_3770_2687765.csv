11,Abstract:,"Haloperoxidases catalyze the oxidation of a halide (e.g., chloride, bromide or iodide) by hydrogen peroxide, which can result in halogenation of organic substrates, the production of dioxygen through subsequent oxidation of a second equivalent of hydrogen peroxide, or the production of hypohalous acid (i.e., HOCl), depending on the identity of the haloperoxidase. Vanadium bromoperoxidase has been isolated primarily from marine algae. Because of the abundance of halogenated reactions, the physiological role of V-BrPO is thought to be in the biosynthesis of the halogenated marine natural products. Vanadium bromoperoxidase does not release an oxidized bromine species (e.g. HOBr, Br2, Br-3) during turnover of certain indole derivatives, because these indoles bind to V- BrPO. The relative reactivity of V-BrPO toward other organic substrates, including substituted indole derivatives, was investigated along with consideration of the nature of the oxidized bromine intermediate as released from or trapped by V-BrPO."
