10,Abstract:,"In the past century coastal zones have been changing from rural and agricultural to urban and industrial, dramatically altering the watersheds and adjacent coastal shelves. In addition, natural events such as fires and floods have their own unique effects. The National Research Council's framework for managing coastal resources stresses that implementation of Integrated Coastal Management needs to be based on the best scientific knowledge available about ecological functions, and that a trans-​disciplinary perspective is critical in coastal problem solving. In response, a one-day symposium was held at the 1995 Annual Meeting of the Southern California Academy of Sciences entitled ""Coastal Watersheds and their Effects on the Ocean Environment."" The purpose was to highlight the importance of the issue, to bring together local research from a variety of disciplines, and to identify gaps in our knowledge base. The subject matter covered in this symposium demonstrates the multifaceted nature of urban watersheds and the complexity of the coastal management issues."
