12,Abstract:,"Four beta-â€‹carbolines, two cyclic peroxides, and two related gamma-lactones were isolated from the deep-water sponge ""Plakortis nigra"" from Palau. The structures of the eight new metabolites were elucidated by interpretation of spectroscopic data. Most of the metabolites inhibited the HCT-116 human colon tumor cell line."
