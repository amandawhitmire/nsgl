8,Abstract:,"A method is proposed for estimating the maximum instantaneous growthrate (MIG) of zooplankton, under conditions where food is not limiting to growth. The MIG method can provide an estimate of the potential production of zooplankton populations, and can also be used to rapidly determine whether or not a zooplankton population is food-limited. The method has a number of advantages over cohort analysis and other traditional techniques. It provides an instantaneous rather than time-averaged estimate of production and may be applied simultaneously to all herbivorous zooplankton species within a community. Data requirements are limited to the zooplankton biomass and the habitat temperature."
