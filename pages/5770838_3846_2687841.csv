11,Abstract:,"In this study, the average chromosome number of the North American white sturgeon was found to be 271+/- 2.5. This number is significantly higher than previous estimates for this species. A representative karyotype was found to consist of 132 meta- and submeta-centric chromosomes, 44 acrocentric chromosomes, and 98 microchromosomeâ€‹s. An improved C-banding technique revealed variation (2-7) between animals in the number of entirely heterochromatic metacentric chromosomes. These heterochromatic chromosomes may represent supernumerary chromosomes. There was no cytogenetic evidence of a heteromorphic sex chromosome pair or any sex-related chromosomal polymorphism in either sex of this species."
