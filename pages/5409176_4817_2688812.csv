9,Abstract:,"The amino acid proline has been implicated in the stabilization of biomacromolecul​es during reduced water states. The ability of this molecule to protect biomacromolecul​es during these stress states may be related to the formation of polymeric aggregates of proline monomers in solution. Calorimetric data show that in increasing concentration of proline in solution the enthalpy associated with the melting of bulk water is greatly reduced, indicating strong hydrogen bonding character of proline in aqueous solution. This work is directed toward understanding the effect of proline on water structure and suggests what role this effect may have in the stabilization of biomacromolecul​es during reduced water states."
