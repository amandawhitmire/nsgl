9,Abstract:,"In 1999, the California state legislature passed the Marine Life Protection Act, which calls for an improvement in the array of marine protected areas (MPAs) and the design of an alternative network that includes fully protected (no-take) reserves. This publication presents to leaders and stakeholders examples of historical, anthropological​, and ecological science-based information pertaining to MPAs and fisheries in California. The objective is to make available such information for public policy debate, not to make recommendations​."
