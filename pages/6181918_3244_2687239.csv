10,Abstract:,"Relative to a handful of other rockfish species, widow rockfish are a strong candidate for marine reserve protection. To a lesser extent, so are aurora and yellowtail rockfishes. Because of their particular reproductive patterns, darkblotched rockfish and Pacific ocean perch are not. These conclusions are the results of a study funded by the California Department of Fish and Game and are relevant to the state's Marine Life Protection Act. Widow rockfish were said to be the strongest candidate for marine reserve protection because of their age-related reproductive patterns, in which females gain fecundity as they age. This fecundity is in part the result of when older females spawn (earlier in the season, when plankton production is at a peak.) The older females also tend to have larger oil globules, making larvae less vulnerable to starvation. Such maternal age effects were most strikingly pronounced in widow rockfishes, less so in aurora and yellowtail rockfishes. The pattern was absent in darkblotched rockfish and Pacific ocean perch. ""Female widow rockfish just get better with age,"" explained the project's leader, UC Santa Cruz professor Steven Berkeley, a pioneer in rockfish studies who died of cancer in June 2007. He was 60. Marine reserves could protect these older, larger animals from being harvested, he believed."
