10,Abstract:,"The authors of this paper discuss one theory of genetic patchiness, that surviving young-​of-​the-​year are the products of spawning by only a small fraction of the adult population, which happened to produce their offspring at a place and time that was suitable for survival. The succession of such cohorts would then lead to the shifting genetic mosaic that is characteristic of marine populations displaying chaotic genetic patchiness. The authors discuss the implications for fisheries management, including marine harvest refugia."
