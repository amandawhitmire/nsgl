15,Abstract:,"An experimental data acquisition system (telepack) was interfaced with a multivariable moored system in order to transmit physical and biooptical data from a coastal mooring site to a shore-based work station, utilizing the cellular telephone system. Data were obtained from the system on a call-up basis at intervals of approximately 8 h. This study demonstrates the utility of a relatively inexpensive communications system for near-real time data acquisition in coastal waters. It also represents an initial step toward development of a worldwide environmental data collection and distribution system that could exploit existing and planned communication resources, including satellites, to provide near-real time two-way, high data rate communications between researchers' work stations and remote, unattended sensor platforms such as buoys and drifters."
