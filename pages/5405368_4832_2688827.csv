9,Abstract:,"Despite the increasing interest in the use of modified atmospheres (MA), the concern about the potential growth of ""Clostridium botulinum"" in fish kept under MA remains the limiting factor to further expansion of the method. This concern stems from the fact that: (1) nonproteolytic ""C. botulinum"" types B, E, and F, all of which occur in aquatic environments, are capable of growth and toxin production at a temperature as low as 3.3 deg. C; (2) ""C. botulinum"" is a highly prevalent natural contaminant of seafood; and (3) the restricted growth of normal aerobic spoilage bacteria of fish flesh or other seafood by MA may enhance growth of ""C. botulinum"", thereby allowing toxin formation before spoilage occurs. The objective of the present study was to test the predictive model approach in rockfish fillets stored at low and abused temperatures under MA and relate the probability of ""C. botulinum"" toxigenesis to fish spoilage time."
