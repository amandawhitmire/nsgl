11,Abstract:,"The development of this strategic plan was designed to allow Sea Grant’s constituencies an opportunity to provide their views on the needs and priorities for California Sea Grant in the next four years. The mission of the California Sea Grant College Program (CSGCP) is to maximize the contribution of universities and affiliated institutions to the wise use of the sea’s resources and the meaningful defense from its hazards through research, education, and advisory services for the benefit of the state and the nation. In the three decades since its inception, Sea Grant has been one of the principal sources of academic research on the coastal ocean, aquaculture, fisheries, seafood, marine biotechnology, ​ ocean and coastal engineering, and ocean policy. The program has also become a major source of marine scientific and management personnel, having supported nearly 900 graduate and undergraduate students specializing in marine disciplines."
