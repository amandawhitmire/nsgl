15,Abstract:,"Variation in settlement of ""Strongylocentr​otus droebachiensis"" in relation to spatial scale and sampling methods was measured in 3 regions of the northwest Atlantic: the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, the Bay of Fundy, and the Gulf of Maine. Settlement was monitored at 2-10 wk intervals from May to August 1994 using plastic turf and scrub brushes as settlement substrata in 3 different collector designs. Rack collectors were 0.01-0.04 m^2 rectangular sections of turf mounted horizontally on wire racks on the bottom. Pipe collectors were 14 cm diameter PVC pipe lined with 0.05 m^2 of turf protected from predators by a grating and suspended 0.2 and 2.3 m off the bottom. Brush collectors were deployed at one site and suspended vertically 15 cm off the bottom. Collectors were placed at 5-30 m depth in kelp beds and sea urchin-​dominated barren grounds, and separated by distances ranging from centimetres (between collectors within sites) to 100's of kilometres (between regions). Order of magnitude differences in settlement were observed between regions, with highest settlement in the Gulf of Maine, lowest settlement in the Bay of Fundy and intermediate settlement in Nova Scotia. Within each region, settlement differed between sites but was within the same order of magnitude. Sites in Nova Scotia and the Gulf of Maine showed greater settlement in the barrens than in adjacent kelp beds. Differences in settlement occurred within sites on collectors of different design. Although these differences may limit comparability between studies, they do not obscure large-scale variation in settlement of ""S. droebachiensis"" between regions."
