10,Abstract:,"Juvenile white sturgeon were fed isonitrogenous diets containing 27.2% glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, lactose, dextrin, raw corn starch or cellulose for 8 wk. Sturgeon fed either the maltose or glucose diets had the highest percent energy retained, followed by those fed either the dextrin, raw corn starch or sucrose diets, whereas those fed either the lactose, fructose or cellulose diets had the lowest. Sturgeon fed either the maltose or glucose diets were hyperlipidemic, having twice the amount of plasma total lipid, triacylglycerol and total cholesterol as fish fed the other carbohydrate sources. These two carbohydrate sources were also more lipogenic. The poor ability of sturgeon to utilize either sucrose or lactose appears to be due to low intestinal sucrase and lactase activities."
