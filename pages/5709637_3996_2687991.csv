16,Abstract:,"Identification of mycobacteria through conventional microbiological methods is cumbersome and time-consuming. Recently a novel bacterial identification method to accurately and rapidly identify different mycobacteria directly from water and clinical isolates. The method utilizes the PCR to amplify a portion of the small subunit rRNA from mycobacteria. An analysis of these data demonstrates that this protocol is effective in identifying 13 different mycobacterial species, has the potential of rapidly (less than 36 h) identifying mycobacterial species directly from clinical specimens, and is capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample."
