9,Abstract:,"A 1953 epidemic in villages on Japan's Minamata Bay first caused public awareness of problems resulting from mercury misuse. Although mercury is a naturally occurring metallic substance and almost all foods contain some mercury, there are some fish and fishery products with higher than normal levels. U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for acceptable levels of mercury in food are discussed briefly as well as the specific problems with mercury levels in swordfish and tuna."
