19,Abstract:,"The dibromocatechol alpha-​O-​methyllanosol, a methyl ether of lanosol, was isolated from both the MeOH and the CH2Cl2 extracts of ""Odonthalia washingtoniensi​s"" and ""Odonthalia floccosa"". Its structure was confirmed through spectroscopic methods and through its synthesis. An investigation of its biological activities revealed that it exhibits a stimulating effect on the growth and elongation of certain terrestrial plants both in the in-vivo and the in-vitro systems."
