10,Abstract:,"Calcareious sponges of the genus ""Leucetta"" are best known as sources of imidazole alkaloids. The exception is the pteridine alkaloid leucettidine, which was isolated from ""Leucetta microraphis"" from Bermuda. The chemistry of a maroon-colored calcareous sponge from Pohnpei that, although quite different in physical appearance, was also identified as ""Leucetta microraphis"", was investigated. Antimicrobial screening of the crude methanolic extract of this sponge revealed mild activity against ""B. subtilis"". A bioassay-guided fractionation resulted in the isolation of leucettamols A and B as the active constituents."
