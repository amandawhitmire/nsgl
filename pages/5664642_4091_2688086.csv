9,Abstract:,"The purpose of this paper is to explore how temporal variation in the quantity and quality of refuge provided by plant structure influences the dynamics of recruitment to local fish populations. The importance of three relationships in determining how changes in plant density affect recruitment is discussed: (1) how the particular architectural features of plants (shape, size, structural complexity) influences the density of recruits, (2) how density of recruits is affected by changes in the quantity and quality of a particular architectural feature of individual plants, and (3) how individual plant architecture is in turn affected by changes in plant density (density-â€‹dependent response of plant shape or height). In combination, these three relationships provide a conceptual framework for predicting how recruitment will respond to fluctuations in plant density that result from disturbance. Interspecific differences between fishes, and between the plant species to which they recruit, show different but predictable effects of plant density on recruitment."
