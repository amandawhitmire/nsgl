10,Abstract:,"The methanol extracts of an abundant undescribed orange sponge of the Jaspidae family yielded two very unusual oxazoles, which were accompanied by just trace amounts of bengamides A and B. The chemistry and spectroscopic data in support of the novel oxazole structures are presented here along with their biotoxic properties."
