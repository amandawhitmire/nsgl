10,Abstract:,"Although fog research has long been conducted, many of the fundamental questions about it still center on fog as a hydrologic input. Modern interdisciplina​ry work has started to focus on how fog affects plant physiology, specifically quantifying how much water plants are deriving from fog and how it affects their vegetative water balance. Stable isotopes have long been used to track the sources and destination of meteoric water, and could be used to assist in fog analysis. I utilized the stable isotopic composition of precipitation to estimate atmospheric controls on water vapor during an extreme weather event and then to estimate the relative contribution of different precipitation types (fog and rain) to two California bunch grasses. Using a wind tunnel I evaluated how even small changes in wind speed affects fog collector interception amounts in a controlled setting. By understanding these mechanistic drivers across scales future work can improve estimates of how occult precipitation impacts terrestrial ecosystems."
