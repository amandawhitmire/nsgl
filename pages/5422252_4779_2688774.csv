11,Abstract:,"Many bacteria in these environments are able to hydrolyze chitin by using two enzymes, chitinase and chitobiase. To begin an analysis of these enzymes, the genes encoding chitinase and chitobiase from the gram-negative marine bacterium ""Vibrio harveyi"" were cloned. It is shown that chitobiase is located in the outer membrane of ""Escherichia coli"" cells containing the cloned chitobiase gene (""chb"")."
