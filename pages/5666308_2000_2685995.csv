12,Abstract:,"Various mechanisms have been proposed as potential causes of the periodic fluctuations in the annual catch of Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister""). Research here was conducted to determine whether available data indicate that variations in currents and wind stress during the crab's larval stages influence subsequent commercial catch. A certain cyclicity in wind stress was apparent; computed correlations indicate that wind stress may contribute to the cyclicity of the annual catch."
