10,Abstract:,"A new model has been developed to describe precipitation in sheets at a moving, planar, interphase boundary in an alloy. The model assumes that the diffusion profile developed by the growing sheet of interphase precipitates is similar to that resulting from the growth of a `pseudophase' of constant composition equal to the average solute concentration in the sheet. The model provides a theoretical rationale for correlations among parameters important in interphase precipitation and gives a coherent description of this phenomenon, upon which further understanding can be based."
