12,Abstract:,"1997-1998 El Nino storms eroded sand beaches, but accreted gravel beaches. Data were collected to test models that predict beach crest height. Wave tank models did not work as well as a physically-â€‹based model. A method for the specification of the appropriate drag coefficient, critical to accurate model performance, is presented and discussed. Further empirical research to quantify relationships between particle diameter, drag, and storm hydrodynamics is necessary."
