10,Abstract:,"The Southern California Bight (SCB) covers a region of complex currents along approximately 300 km of the Mexican and southern California shoreline. This study includes ascidian species abundance data from 1994 to 2000 from 29 sites within the 12 major harbors of the Bight north of the Mexico/US border, plus two sites in Ensenada (Baja California) sampled in August 2000. Nonindigenous ascidians form a major part of the fouling community biomass on floating docks in these harbors. Nine solitary and five colonial species are present, 13 of them in San Diego Bay, the largest bay in this region. This study reports additional surveys to the authors' 1998 paper, documents the newly arrived ""Botrylloides perspicuum"", and corrects the records of two species. A main focus is the listing and abundance of species at each survey site and an attempt to analyze the differences between sites and between seasons within a single harbor with reference to variations in water movement, temperature, salinity, pollution factors, and competition. Several species appeared for the first time in southern California during 1994 to 1997, apparently correlated with the influx of warmer water during the El Nino of that time. Subsequent surveys show that all of these species have persisted, several have dramatically increased in abundance and distribution, and an additional species has successfully invaded."
