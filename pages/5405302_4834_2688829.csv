9,Abstract:,"Sponges of the order Dictyoceratida are often prominent members of South Pacific island coral reefs. Biologically, they are unique as their skeleton is fibrous rather than mineral in content. Their natural products are also unusual in that a growing number of sesterterpenes are being reported from such sponges. During field work in the Kingdom of Tonga, an extremely abundant member of this order, ""Hyrtios erecta"" (family Thorectidae), was collected; its crude extract showed both anti-​inflammatory activity and inhibition of sea urchin cell division. Eleven sesterterpenes have been characterized from the biotoxic extracts of ""Hyrtios erecta""."
