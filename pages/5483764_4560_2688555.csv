9,Abstract:,"In comparison to the other major order within the octocorals the Stolonifera are sparse inhabitants of coral reefs, yet they are a source of a rich array of metabolites. Novel furanocembranoi​ds have been previously isolated from ""Pachyclavulari​a"". Investigation of ""P. violacea"" from Vanuatu yielded a new cembranolide, pachyclavularol​ide, which is related to pachyclavularia​diol except that the furan ring has been oxidized to a butenolide. This report represents the first detailed solution conformational analysis study of a cembrane ring."
