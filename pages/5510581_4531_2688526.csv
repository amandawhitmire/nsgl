13,Abstract:,"The phenomenon of growth retardation (stunting) of coho salmon after transfer to seawater (SW) net pens has received sporadic attention for at least a decade. Premature introduction into SW, before completion of the parr/smolt transformation, or transfer to SW in the postsmoltificat​ion period results in poor growth and eventual mortality of a variable but often large percentage of fish. Stunts transferred back into fresh water (FW) resume apparently normal growth. Tracing the events that occur during the reversal of stunting may provide clues as to the initial endocrine events related to growth retardation. Researchers here documented the circulating levels of several hormones in the stunt in SW and after transfer to FW for 3 weeks. In addition, the activity of the interrenal gland in stunted and normally-​growing coho in SW was assessed. The results are discussed in relation to the possible causes of stunting and the involvement of the endocrine system in growth retardation."
