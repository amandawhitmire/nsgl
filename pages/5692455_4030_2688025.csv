9,Abstract:,"Pleuronectiform fishes (flatfishes) hatch as bilaterally symmetrical larvae, but during metamorphosis one eye migrates to the opposite side of the head and the fish come to rest on their blind (or eyeless) side. As a consequence of eye migration, all pleuronectiform fish possess some degree of cephalic skeletal and muscular bilateral asymmetry. Despite the unique questions that pleuronectiform fishes pose for evolutionary and functional morphologists, the basic kinematics of feeding behavior have yet to be described for any species of flatfish. Therefore, this study has three major goals: (1) to describe the kinematics of prey capture behavior in a flatfish, (2) to compare the kinematics with those described in the literature for other ray-finned (actinopterygiaâ€‹n) fishes, and (3) to test the hypothesis that functional bilateral asymmetry exists during prey capture in flatfish by comparing movements of features on one side of the head with movements of homologous features on the other side of the head."
