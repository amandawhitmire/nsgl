10,Abstract:,"Over the past few years numerous resource managers, resource users, researchers, and members of the general public have expressed a need for a comprehensive guide to California's Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The need for a comprehensive guide is due to the fact that the current MPA system in California is extremely confusing and complex, and the information related to MPAs is scattered and inconsistent. This situation is certainly not unique to California, and mirrors the status of MPAs worldwide. This guide, is an effort to compile and organize available information on California's complex system of MPAs. Though the guide will not simplify the complexity of the system, it will eliminate some confusion about California MPAs, provide a foundation upon which to build a more rational, manageable MPA system, one that is more successful in achieving the objective of better protecting marine resources. The guide provides site maps, site summaries, and regulatory excerpts for each California MPA."
