12,Abstract:,"Stormwater runoff plumes, municipal wastewater plumes, and natural hydrocarbon seeps are important pollution hazards for the heavily populated Southern California Bight. Here, scientists use imagery from space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), complemented by field measurements, to examine these hazards in the bight. The hazards are detectable in SAR imagery because they deposit surfactants on the sea surface that smooth capillary and small gravity waves. This produces areas of reduced backscatter compared to the surrounding ocean, which are readily detected in SAR imagery. The authors suggest that high-resolution SAR, which obtains useful data regardless of darkness or cloud cover, could be an important observation tool for routine monitoring of coastal marine pollution hazards."
