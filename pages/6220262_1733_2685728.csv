15,Abstract:,"We investigated the potential use of open coastal habitat over the continental shelf as a nursery area for the common thresher shark Alopias vulpinus. Seven juvenile threshers were tracked using acoustic telemetry to determine their movement patterns and nursery habitat in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Tracked sharks occupied waters over the continental shelf 87% of the time. These waters had an average (� SD) sea surface temperature of 18.8 +/- 1.6 deg C and chlorophyll concentrations that were an order of magnitude higher than in adjacent waters offshore of the continental shelf. Tracked sharks had a mean rate of movement of 1.63 +/- 0.56 km h-1, and some sharks exhibited high site fidelity. The vertical distribution of juvenile threshers was generally limited to the upper 20 m of the water, and most sharks showed diel depth distribution patterns, with daytime depths significantly greater than nighttime depths. An analysis of SCB commercial fishery observer data confirms that juvenile common threshers are most frequently captured over the continental shelf. This region appears to provide juvenile threshers with ample food resources and reduced predation risk relative to adult habitat, and partially satisfies more quantitative nursery area criteria recently established in the literature."
