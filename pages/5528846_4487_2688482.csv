11,Abstract:,"The role of the pituitary hormone prolactin (PRL) as a freshwater (FW)-adapting hormone in many euryhaline teleosts is widely recognized. In many of these species, a hypoosmotic milieu stimulates and a hyperosmotic milieu inhibits PRL secretion in-vitro and in-vivo. Salmonids, however, do not display this pattern of control of PRL secretion. This study examines anadromous coho salmon throughout the parr-smolt transformation in the springs of 1987 and 1988. Changes in pituitary PRL synthetic rate and influences of osmotic pressure (OP) and cortisol on PRL cell activity in-vitro are reported. Results suggest that OP has no specific direct effect on PRL release; however, cortisol inhibits pituitary PRL synthesis and content in a dose-related manner and also inhibits the percent release of total and 35S-PRL, suggesting that cortisol may be an important regulator of PRL cell activity during the parr-smolt transformation."
