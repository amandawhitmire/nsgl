12,Abstract:,"Renal coccidia were discovered during an investigation of a mass mortality of California's black abalone, ""Haliotis cracherodii"". Further examination determined that the six species of abalone sampled throughout California had morphologically indistinguishab​le renal coccidia. In this study the question of whether the renal coccidian was transmissible directly or indirectly via infective waters to seed abalone was examined. Also, transmission directly from infected red abalone to pinto abalone that were free of renal coccidia was tested. One hundred percent of the pinto abalone that shared aquaria with infected red abalone had coccidian infections after 17 mo of cohabitation. No change in the condition of the abalone or mortality resulted from natural or experimental infections with coccidia."
