11,Abstract:,"Ceratomyxa shasta, Oncorhynchus mykiss, survival analysis, quantitative trait loci"
12,,"""Ceratomyxa shasta"" is enzootic to some rivers of the Pacific Northwest and California, and has caused extensive mortalities of salmonids, the only known host of the actinosporean stage of the pathogen. Mortalities from ""C. shasta"" are induced by severe inflammation and necrosis of the intestinal tract, and no therapeutants have been discovered for the treatment of ceratomyxosis. Inheritance studies by previous investigators suggested that ""C. hasta"" resistance is genetically controlled,but none have revealed the number and locations of gene regions associated with resistance. Here, the authors characterized differences in resistance among clonal lines, and used line crosses between clonal lines with resistance differences for a genetic analysis of ""C. shasta"" resistance in ""Oncorhynchus mykiss"", following a short term in situ exposure to the pathogen. The authors found that Oregon State University (OSU) x Arlee (ARL) clonal hybrids were highly susceptible, while OSU x Clearwater (CW) hybrids were highly resistant to ""C. shasta."" Doubled haploids, produced by androgenesis from an F(1) hybrid between the OSU and CW lines, were evaluated for the co-segregation of molecular markers and resistance phenotype. Amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers, used to construct a genetic linkage map in this cross, were tested for associations with resistance expressed as absolute survival (binary trait) and days to death (survival analysis). Segregation of the resistance phenotype suggested that the resistance was inherited as a single Mendelian locus, but the binary trait failed to map to a single genomic location. Markers identified in single- marker analyses were used in multiple-​regression model selection, within both the linear regression and Cox proportional-​hazards survival analysis frameworks, to determine the number and potential location of loci simultaneously contributing to variation in the survival phenotypes of doubled-haploid progeny. The authors found multiple genomic loci associated with ""C. sasta"" resistance through these models, confirming studies by previous investigators that suggested ""C. sasta"" resistance is polygenic."
