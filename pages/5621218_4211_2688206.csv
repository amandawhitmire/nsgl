11,Abstract:,"Although many aspects of the general biology of lobsters were known by the 1970s, surprisingly little attention had been paid to the husbandry of rapidly growing juveniles. Answers to a variety of questions relating to appropriate culture systems, feeds, etc., essential in developing a viable technology, had to be developed from scratch. To provide such answers, a number of laboratories, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, pursued research programs focused on the American lobster. The goal of this chapter is to review the efforts made to develop culture techniques for juvenile lobsters as well as to delineate those aspects relating to commercial-â€‹scale culture which remain to be explored."
