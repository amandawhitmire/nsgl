10,Abstract:,"It is often important to estimate the abundance of a fish when the stock is somewhat depleted. For pelagic species this presents great operational difficulties, because adult surveys may be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Here a method for estimating the spawning biomass of a stock by means of egg or larval surveys is introduced and a series of models for presence-​absence sampling of eggs or larvae is developed. The models are based on an underlying probabilistic description of the aggregation of eggs or larvae, a search process, and a description of habitat structure. Methodologies are given for estimating distribution of the size of the spawning biomass from presence-​absence data."
