9,Abstract:,"Life cycles of five species of nemerteans that are symbiotic egg predators of decapod crustaceans are reviewed and compared. These life cycles range from the relatively simple life cycle of ""Carcinonemerte​s regicides"" from the red king crab, ""Paralithodes camtschatica"", to the complex life cycle of ""C. errans"" on the Dungeness crab, ""Cancer magister"". Increased complexity of these life cycles is evaluated as a series of adaptations to cope with life history features of their respective hosts, including seasonal brooding, rapid embryogenesis and brooding in alternate years."
