7,Abstract:,"This paper presents the results of analyses of an extensive set of field-caught anchovy larvae. The specific objectives for the field investigation were: (1) to determine whether there was a significant difference in the lipid components of the anchovy larvae between stations on a cruise, and (2) to try to identify habitats that are well-suited to the requirements of anchovy larvae by comparing the condition of the larvae with physical and biological data obtained from each station."
