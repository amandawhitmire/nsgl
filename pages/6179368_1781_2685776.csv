9,Abstract:,"Recent fermentation studies have identified actinomycetes of the marine-dwelling genus Salinispora as prolific natural product producers. Sequence analysis of the 5.2 Mb S. tropica CNB-440 and 5.7 Mb S. arenicola CNS-205 circular genomes revealed complex and diverse secondary metabolomes rivaling the soil-dwelling streptomycetes, which produce the majority of the natural antibiotics. Both genomes feature polyketide synthase systems of every known formally classified family, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and several hybrid systems. The crosstalk between natural product chemistry, genomics and bioinformatics facilitated the discovery of new chemical entities and enzymatic processes as well as new approaches inspired by natural product biosynthesis to aid genome finishing of highly repetitive regions. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of the two Salinispora genomes has begun to shed light on the biology of these widespread sodium-​dependent marine bacteria from the Tropics."
