14,Abstract:,"Hosted by Oregon Sea Grant, this webinar is for students in grades 6-12 who want to explore careers in marine science. Erica Fruh talks about her work as a fisheries biologist with the Northwest Fisheries Science Center. She uses an unmanned, underwater device to photograph the seafloor and the species that live there, including corals off Northern California and a sponge reef off Washington. For her work, she has traveled to the Channel Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, the Hawaiian Islands and the Gulf of Mexico. Erica has a master's degree in marine resource management from Oregon State University. Alexa Kownacki, a doctoral student in the College of Agricultural Sciences at Oregon State University, talks about her research on the health of common bottlenose dolphins off California. She is on a scholarship from the Department of Defense. Prior to OSU, Alexa worked on projects involving elephants in Tanzania, reef fish in Australia, zooplankton in Antarctica and rhinos and cheetahs in South Africa. She was previously an intern with the National Marine Fisheries Service. Lindsay Carroll, who coordinates Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program, serves as a moderator on this webinar, which was recorded on May 27, 2020."
