9,Abstract:,"In teleost fish, hypothalamic fibers terminate in proximity to adenohypophysiaâ€‹l cells of the pituitary, thereby circumventing a functional median eminence and a hypophysial portal system, structures considered to be both ancient and conservative in vertebrate evolution. Thus, unlike the situation in most other vertebrates, teleosts have a more or less direct neural control of pituitary function. The focus of this review is the control of prolactin and growth hormone secretion in teleosts, with primary emphasis on the tilapia."
