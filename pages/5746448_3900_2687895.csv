12,Abstract:,"The marine toxin okadaic acid (OKA) is a polyether fatty acid that has been reported to cause diarrheic shellfish poisoning, tumor promotion, and to reversibly inhibit serine-​threonine phosphatase 1 and 2A. The authors have previously shown that PMA-stimulated superoxide anion generation was inhibited by OKA in human HL-60 cells, rat PMN and Kupffer cells, and enhanced in rat alveolar macrophages. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if OKA's effect on rat PMN superoxide anion generation was linked to protein tyrosine phosphorylation​. OKA reduced both PMA-stimulated anion generation and tyrosine phosphorylation in rat PMN."
