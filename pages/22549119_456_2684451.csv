20,Abstract:,"More than half of the population of the continental United States resides in coastal communities, which are increasingly home to commercial shellfish aquaculture operations. Consequently, a variety of user conflicts can arise as states seek to encourage the development or expansion of shellfish aquaculture. Each of these conflicts creates the potential for opposition and legal challenges to the industry. An understanding of the legal and regulatory context governing shellfish aquaculture can assist in managing conflicts related to shellfish aquaculture. In 2017, the National Sea Grant College Program funded a multi institutional, national collaboration to examine legal impediments to shellfish aquaculture across the United States. In collaboration with shellfish industry members and the wider Sea Grant network, the Project Team identified eight priority legal and policy barriers or success stories that would benefit from the development of case studies. The identified topics for the case studies were: 1. Impact of endangered species act listings; 2. Nationwide Permit 48; 3. Access to public boat launches; 4. Access to nursery upweller sites; 5. Guidance for the aquaculture industry in Virginia; 6. Use conflicts on the Lynnhaven River, Virginia; 7. Gaps in Georgia's permitting program; and 8. Certification of shellfish growing areas in Federal waters.
