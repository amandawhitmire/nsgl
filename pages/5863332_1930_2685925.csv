11,Abstract:,"There is a paucity of information regarding how members of disparate ethnic groups utilize coastal resources in Los Angeles, and how their practices and perceptions might impact the coastal zone and marine wildlife in the long term. This study, consisting of a telephone survey of Los Angeles county residents, was designed to determine how demographic traits, socioeconomic status, personal background features, and past or present geographic and cultural context might shape attitudes toward marine wildlife in the Los Angeles coastal zone. The survey instrument was comprised of questions and statements surrounding respondents' demographics, beach utilization and activities, knowledge about marine wildlife and the coastal zone, stance on policy issues, attitudes, attitudinal change, and cross-cultural attitudes. This extensive report presents the results of the survey and discusses the implications for policy and future research. Overall, respondents exhibited strong ""Environmental- Stewardship and Aesthetic"" attitudes, as well as moderately strong ""Animal Welfare, Animal Rights, and Environmental- Naturalistic"" attitudes. However, differences in attitudes across race/ethnic groupings were marked. The strongest contrasts were between Latinos and Asian-Pacific Islanders: the former being far less anthropocentric​. Asian-Pacific Islander respondents exhibited a more utilitarian attitude than the other groups and were much less likely to support animal welfare. In contrast, Latinos were far more biocentric than other groups, and had the highest mean 'Environmental Stewardship' score."
