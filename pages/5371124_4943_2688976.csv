10,Abstract:,"A model for chitinase production during growth of ""Serratia marcescens"" QMB 1466 on chitin was developed using the rate of chitin hydrolysis to estimate bacterial growth rate. In relating growth with enzyme synthesis the total enzyme concentration was used as the sum of the enzyme present in the bulk of the fermentation broth and the enzyme adsorbed on the chitin particles. The model's equations were fitted to experimental results from both continuous and batch fermentation to obtain parameters describing substrate yield, metabolic maintenance, and enzyme yields."
