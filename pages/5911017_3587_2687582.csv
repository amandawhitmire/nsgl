12,Abstract:,"In this paper, using data from Willapa Bay, a coastal plain estuary on the Washington coast, the authors demonstrate that during the summertime upwelling-​dominant period, estuary water properties have significant variability on scales of 3-10 days and that the origin of these variations is almost completely controlled by oceanic intrusions. Because of its location just north of the Columbia River, the estuary has both river plume and upwelling influences. The comprehensive dataset is unique in that it has sufficient spatial resolution to trace water property changes from the coast up the estuary, to estimate the rate of progression as well as the modifying effect of the intrusion on along-estuary density gradients and estuarine residual velocities, and to determine the dominant mechanisms responsible for the up-estuary advance of the coastal water."
