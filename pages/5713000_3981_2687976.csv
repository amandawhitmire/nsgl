11,Abstract:,"Coastal wetlands are affected by a variety of pollutants, such as sediments, nutrients, bacteria, and toxic materials. The federal Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990 directed the states to reduce pollution from nonpoint sources, such as agriculture, forestry, urban, and boating. This report is part of an educational program designed to assist agricultural producers in reducing nonpoint source pollution by using the best management practices. The report explains what coastal wetlands are, especially those of San Diego County; the benefits these wetlands provide; how the wetlands have been affected by coastal development; types of nonpoint source pollutants; and how pollution control efforts help to assure the health and productivity of the wetlands and their ability to provide benefits to society. This report will also serve as a useful reference for educators and others with an interest in coastal water quality and wetland issues."
