9,Abstract:,"Although the effects of parasitic castration have been largely overlooked, parasites commonly castrate a large number of crustacean, mollusk and echinoderm hosts. This study attempted to determine if and how parasitic castration reduces the population density of the salt marsh snail ""Cerithidea californica"". In natural snail populations there was a negative correlation between snail density and prevalence of trematodes. A manipulation of snail density and larval trematode prevalence indicated that larval trematodes reduced the reproductive output of their host snail population. In addition, the presence of parasitized snails reduced the growth rate of unparasitized snails and parasitized snails suffered differentially high mortality."
