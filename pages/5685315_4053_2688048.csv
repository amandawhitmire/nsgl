11,Abstract:,"GOES data are known to be contaminated with stripes whose presence affects the usefulness of the data in quantitative studies. This article: (1) reviews the causes of the striping; (2) develops frequency domain and spatial domain finite impulse response (FIR) filters for minimizing the stripes in the data while simultaneously introducing minimum distortion into the filtered data; and (3) quantitatively compares the results obtained with these new filtering methods with those produced by traditional destriping methods (e.g., simple smoothing, moment matching, histogram matching). Results show that a finite impulse response filter, implemented in either the spatial or Fourier domain, is superior to all other methods evaluated."
