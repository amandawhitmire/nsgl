10,Abstract:,"Production of a specified radiation pattern is a key part in the design of most acoustic systems. A uniformly excited transducer, while relatively straightforward in its construction, produces sidelobes that may be unacceptably high for a given application. This paper describes the optimum mean square quantizer approach as an optimal way to approximate a continuous shading using a small number of constant amplitude segments. Both the sizes and the amplitude levels of the elements are allowed to vary, permitting better performance for a fixed number of elements than might be achievable for the same number of equisized elements. Development is limited to two one-dimensional cases, the linear segmented transducer and the radially symmetric segmented transducer."
