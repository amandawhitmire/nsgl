10,Abstract:,"Recently, much attention has centered on the white sturgeon ""Acipenser transmontanus"" in California, primarily due to its increasing popularity as a sport fish and its potential for cultivation. Despite the popularity and economic importance of this species, information on size, age composition, and growth is not well developed. Yet these data are essential for establishing adequate management of the fishery. The specific objectives of this study were (1) to assess the use of several calcified structures for determining the age of white sturgeon, (2) to develop techniques that would elucidate growth patterns in these structures and make them more useful for age determination, and (3) to compare age estimates from different structures to determine the most precise method for determining age and growth parameters."
