8,Abstract:,"""Cherax tenuimanus"" (marron) and ""Cherax albidus"" (koonac) are fresh-water crayfish native to the large streams of southwestern Australia. ""Cherax tenuimanus"" is the third largest species of crayfish in the world and attains weights of approximately 2 kg. ""C. albidus"" is smaller than C. tenuimanus"", yet is still much larger than the native American genera (""Pacifastacus, Procambarus"") which weigh less than one fiftieth of a kilogram. ""Cherax tenuimanus"" and ""C. albidus"" are excellent animals for aquaculturing, because, in addition to their large size, they are highly palatable, do not burrow, have an uncomplicated life cycle, and grow large farily rapidly. A complete understanding of the reproductive biology of species of ""Cherax"" will aid in their aquaculture. Improved fixation procedures have been used to examine and compare the ultrastructure of sperm from ""C. tenuimanus"" and ""C. albidus""."
