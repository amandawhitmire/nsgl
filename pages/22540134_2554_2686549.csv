15,Abstract:,"Surface waters are essential natural resources. They are also receiving waters for a variety of anthropogenicwa​ste streams that carry a myriad of pollutants including pathogens. Watershed and fate andtransport models can help inform the spatial and temporal extent of microbial pollution from point andnon-point sources and thus provide useful information for managing surface waters. Viruses areparticularly important water-related pathogens because they often have a low infectious dose, whichmeans that ingestion of even a small volume of water containing a low concentration of virions has thepotential to cause disease. We conducted a systematic review of the literature, following best practices,to gather decay rate constants (k) of mammalian waterborne viruses (enteroviruses, adenoviruses,no​roviruses, astroviruses, rotaviruses, and hepatitis A viruses) and coliphages in raw surface waters to aidin the parameterizatio​n of virus fate and transport models.We identified 562 k values from the literature,with the largest number identified for enteroviruses and coliphages and the smallest for astrovirus,hepa​titis A virus, and norovirus. Average k values for each virus varied from 0.07 to 0.9 per day, in orderfrom smallest to largest: Norwalk virus (i.e., noroviruses) < Human astrovirus < Mastadenovirus (i.e., adenoviruses)< Hepatovirus A (i.e., hepatitis A viruses) < Rotavirus A < coliphages < Enterovirus. A metaanalysisinv​estigated how k varied among viruses for experiments conducted with different virus serotypesor species at different temperatures, salinities, and sunlight exposures, and for experiments thatenumerated viruses using different methodologies. Virus species or serotype did not affect k amongdecay experiments. k values were generally larger for experiments conducted at higher temperatures, insunlight, and in estuarine waters, and enumerated using culture methods. k values were statisticallydi​fferent between virus types with Norwalk virus, Hepatovirus A, and Mastadenovirus having smaller kvalues than other viruses, controlling for experimental condition and enumeration method. While Fþcoliphage k values were similar to those of Enterovirus, Human astrovirus, and Rotavirus A, they weredifferent from those of the other mammalian viruses. This compilation of coliphage and mammalianvirus k values provides essential information for researchers and risk assessors who model virus fate andtransport in surface waters and identifies avenues for future research to fill knowledge gaps."
