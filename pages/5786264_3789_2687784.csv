10,Abstract:,"A survey of 253 visitors to an urban museum was undertaken to explore attitudes toward marine wildlife and how such attitudes varied with cultural background. This paper summarizes a bivariate analysis of responses. Socio- demographic findings linked variables such as education and income levels to various attitudes, and these same variables were found to be linked to cultural groups. Cross-cultural conflicts over attitudes toward animals and suggestions for future research are discussed."
