8,Abstract:,"The author presents an overview of recent research on the isolation and characterizatio​n of members of the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) neuropeptide family. There are two subfamilies of this neuropeptide group, based upon the presence or absence of C-terminal CHH precursor-​related peptide. There are also sequence motif differences between these subfamilies. Most of the peptides comprising the family are synthesized and released by the eyestalk X- organ/sinus gland complex. Recent experiments have demonstrated the presence of extra-eyestalk cells that produce CHH and the assignment of additional functions to this hormone family."
