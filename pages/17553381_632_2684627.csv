16,Abstract:,"In order to protect the diverse ecosystems of coastal California, a series of marine protectedareas (MPAs) have been established. The ability of these MPAs to preserve and potentiallyenha​nce marine resources can only be assessed if these habitats are monitored throughtime. This study establishes a baseline for monitoring the spawning activity of fish in theMPAs adjacent to Scripps Institution of Oceanography (La Jolla, CA, USA) by sampling fisheggs from the plankton. Using vertical plankton net tows, 266 collections were made fromthe Scripps Pier between 23 August 2012 and 28 August 2014; a total of 21,269 eggs wereobtained. Eggs were identified using DNA barcoding: the COI or 16S rRNA gene was amplifiedfrom individual eggs and sequenced. All eggs that were successfully sequenced couldbe identified from a database of molecular barcodes of California fish species, resulting inspecies-level identification of 13,249 eggs. Additionally, a surface transport model ofcoastal circulation driven by current maps from high frequency radar was used to constructprobab​ility maps that estimate spawning locations that gave rise to the collected eggs.These maps indicated that currents usually come from the north but water parcels tend tobe retained within the MPA; eggs sampled at the Scripps Pier have a high probability of havingbeen spawned within the MPA. The surface transport model also suggests that althoughlarvae have a high probability of being retained within the MPA, there is also significant spilloverinto nearby areas outside the MPA. This study provides an important baseline foraddressing the extent to which spawning patterns of coastal California species may beaffected by future changes in the ocean environment."
