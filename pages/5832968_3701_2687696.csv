10,Abstract:,"Metal speciation significantly influences the geochemical cycling of trace metals in natural waters and can control metal bioavailability and toxicity. This study applied advanced analytical techniques to address some difficulties encountered in identifying metal organic species. Size- exclusion chromatography (SEC) was directly coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine conditional stability constants of metal complexes with strong organic ligands in competitive equilibration experiments. The method was validated with well-defined organic ligands in ligand competition studies with a single metal and a binary metal mixture. Model studies using metal complexes with weaker organic ligands demonstrated that the technique is subject to kinetic limitations since labile metal-organic complexes can dissociate during chromatographic separation. Nonetheless, the kinetic window of the method should be appropriate for the strong ligands postulated to control metal speciation in natural waters."
