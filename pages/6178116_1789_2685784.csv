14,Abstract:,"We examined the zooplankton community structure in the Gulf of the Farallones in 2004 and 2005. We characterized the physical oceanography using CTD, and determined zooplankton species composition and abundance using nets. We used cluster analysis, non-metric multidimensiona​l scaling (NMDS) and indicator species analysis to explore patterns in community structure. Cluster analysis showed two major groups. Group 1 included a cold water community while Group 2 included a warm water community. Species richness in Group 1 was greater than in Group 2. Group 2 was divided in two groups: 2A included most samples collected in 2005 except for May 2005 which segregated to 2B. A 2-dimensional NMDS explained 81.4% of the variance in community structure. Axis 1 was correlated with mixed layer depth and thermocline gradient, while Axis 2 was correlated with temperature and strength of the chlorophyll maximum. The euphausiid Euphausia pacifica was a strong indicator of the cold water group. This study illustrates the dynamic nature of the zooplankton community which can change drastically in a relatively short period of time with negative effects to higher trophic levels."
