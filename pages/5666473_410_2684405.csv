10,Abstract:,"The April 1985 workshop on proliferative kidney disease (PKD) at UC, Davis was designed to present information from all laboratories participating in research on the disease. The first day was devoted to formal presentations; the second to an open discussion. Current knowledge of the disease was summarized and the techniques to diagnose PKD reviewed. Existing policies to control the disease in N. America were discussed and a list of recommendations for future studies developed. What follows in this publication is a summary of the formal presentations."
