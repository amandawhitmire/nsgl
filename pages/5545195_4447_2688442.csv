9,Abstract:,"This report summarizes data on the distribution, abundance, and lengths of all seven species of juvenile salmonids (genus ""Oncorhynchus"") --coho (""O. kisutch""), chinook (""O. tshawytscha""), chum (""O. keta""), pink (""O. gorbuscha""), and sockeye salmon (""O. nerka""). and steelhead (""O. mykiss"") and cutthrout trout (""O. clarki clarki"")-​-​caught by purse seines in the ocean off Oregon and Washington 1981-1985. Preferences for specific salinities or temperatures were not obvious for any species, although catch rates of juvenile coho salmon were highest in years when chlorophyll content was also high. It is estimated that hatchery coho salmon smolts comprised 74% of the juvenile coho salmon catches. The remaining 26% were presumably wild fish or hatchery fish released as fingerlings. Hatchery coho salmon were caught roughly in proportion to the numbers released. No juvenile coho salmon with coded wire tags were caught that had originated from either California or Puget Sound hatcheries."
