10,Abstract:,"There is a paucity of information on the nutrient requirements of sturgeon, especially under hatchery conditions. This information is needed to develop a cost-effective commercial feed for efficient production of this fish. Protein, the most expensive ingredient in fish feeds, is required in high amounts by most fishes. Furthermore, protein deficiency is known to have a profound effect on the growth of animals. The objective of this study was to determine the dietary protein requirement of hatchery-​produced juvenile white sturgeon. Results suggest 40% dietary crude protein from a good quality source will result in optimum juvenile growth."
