9,Abstract:,"The dark portion of the light/dark cycle initiated pre-spawning behavior in the penaeid shrimp, ""Sicyonia ingentis"". Persistent swimming in the water column (pre-spawning behavior) correlated well with ovulation. Over 96% of the animals that exhibited active swimming behavior were ovulated. More than 87% of the ovulated animals responded to probing of the ovipores by immediately spawning. The ova from probe-induced spawns underwent a normal developmental sequence. A reliable and predictable technique for the assessment of ovulation and acquisition of viable ova from ""S. ingentis"" is described."
