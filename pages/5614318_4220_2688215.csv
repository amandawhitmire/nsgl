9,Abstract:,"A combination of field and laboratory experiments are made in order to expand our knowledge of naturally occurring oscillatory boundary layers. Ventilated oscillatory boundary layers arise from a flow which oscillates parallel to a permeable bed which is subject to oscillating percolation of the same frequency as the bed parallel flow. Measurements of boundary layer velocities, bed stress and turbulent flow properties are presented. Field measurements of wave-driven ventilation are compared against linear theory, and ventilation is investigated as a possible mechanism for the maintenance of beach slope. When compared against net bed stresses resulting from nonlinear wave forms or bottom wind, the ventilation-​induced stress asymmetry is an important mechanism for medium-to coarse-grained sediments."
