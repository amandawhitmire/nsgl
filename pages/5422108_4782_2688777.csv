12,Abstract:,"Luffariellolide is a sesterterpene from the Palauan sponge ""Luffariella"" sp. that has useful anti-​inflammatory properties. In contrast with the irreversible action of manoalide on purified bee venom phospholipase A2, luffariellolide is a slightly less potent but partially reversible PLA2 inhibitor."
