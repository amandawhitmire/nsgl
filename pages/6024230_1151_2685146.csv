11,Abstract:,"Despite viral contamination of recreational waters, only bacterial, not viral, indicators are monitored routinely, due to a lack of rapid and cost-effective assays. The authors used negatively charged filters to capture enteroviruses from seawater and freshwater. Viral RNA was extracted using a commercial kit, and the viruses were quantified by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Poliovirus (6.6 to 330,000 virus particles/ml) was added to samples from watersheds in Los Angeles, California, and analysis showed that with 50-ml samples, a cellulose acetate/nitrate (HA) filter yielded final recovery of 51% (r^2) = 0.99) in freshwater and 23% (r^2- 0.90) in seawater. However, for additions of low levels of virus (more likely to represent field samples; <10M enterovirus particles/ml), the recovery was lower and more variable, with HA being best in freshwater (17%, r^2 = 0.97) and the type GF/F glass filter having higher average recovery in seawater (GF/F, 17%; r^2 = 0.93; HA 12%, r^2 = 0.87). The optimized method was used with 1-liter field samples from two very different freshwater ""creeks"" that drain into Santa Monica Bay, California: Topanga Creek (TC), a relatively pristine mountain creek, and Ballona Creek (BC), a concrete-lined urban storm drain. One TC site out of 10 and 2 BC sites out of 7 tested significantly positive for enteroviruses, with higher enterovirus concentrations in BC than in TC (ca. 10 to 25 versus 1 equivalent enterovirus particle/ml). The presented filtration-​qRT-​PCR approach is fast (<8 h from sampling to results), sensitive, and cost efficient and is promising for monitoring viral contamination in environmental water samples."
