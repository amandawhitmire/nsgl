8,Abstract:,"This paper examines the public trust doctrine and its legitimacy and viability as an anticipatory response by the California courts to a rising sea level. The doctrine dictates that the state holds tidelands and submerged lands in trust for the public. The doctrine's history and rationale, scientific studies of rising sea levels, legitimacy of an anticipatory use of the doctrine by California courts, and the desirability of a judicial vs. legislative response to rising sea levels are discussed. The author concludes that the legislature is the most appropriate vehicle for a global response utilizing this powerful tool; the courts would still be able to countermand any inappropriate legislative response."
