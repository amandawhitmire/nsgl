13,Abstract:,"The impact of fluvial inputs and atmospheric deposition of nutrients in coastal tropical coral reef ecosystems remains relatively poorly studied compared to temperate ecosystems. In particular, a dearth of high temporal frequency measurements has inhibited the characterizatio​n of the variability inherent in such systems, which are driven by an irregular occurrence of climatic events superimposed on seasonal patterns. Intense rainstorms that trigger runoff into the coastal ocean combine with marine physical forcing mechanisms, such as wind, waves and tides to drive the response of subtropical to tropical coastal ecosystems. System perturbations induce changes that are evident in as quickly as a few hours, although longer term seasonal and annual cycles are also clearly evident. This presentation describes how waters of a semi-enclosed tropical embayment respond to land derived nutrient inputs and physical forcings associated with local climatic conditions. We present data collected during three and a half years of near-real time observations at a fixed station concurrently with spatially distributed synoptic waters column sampling over a larger section of Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Nutrient loading associated with runoff or atmospheric deposition typically leads to an increase in the N:P ratio (up to 48) of these normally Nlimited (N:P = 2-4) bay waters and drives phytoplankton biomass growth, which in turn cause sharp but generally short term changes in the CO2 flux between the ocean and the atmosphere. During periods of heavy rain and intense phytoplankton growth, the bay can switch from being a source of CO2 to a sink from the atmosphere. The efficient uptake of nutrient subsidies by primary producers, however, generally leads to a rapid return of bay waters to nitrogen limitation and to being, once again, a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Chlorophyll concentrations can increase dramatically from baseline levels of approx. 0.5μg/L following a storm, to ~10μg/L, depending on the suspended particle load, available light, and nutrient subsidy, but these levels quickly fall back to ~2 μg/L before returning slowly to baseline conditions on timescales ranging from a few days to several weeks. Under certain conditions of runoff, the Kaneohe Bay system appear to switch temporarily to P-limitation as previously described by Ringuet and Mackenzie (2005)."
