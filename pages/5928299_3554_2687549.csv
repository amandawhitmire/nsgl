16,Abstract:,"Chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with the persistent production of proinflammatory mediators and tissue hyperplasia. By targeting certain kinases involved in both processes, it may be possible to reduce the adverse nature of chronic inflammatory disorders. Here scientists report the novel pharmacological properties of scytonemim, a yellow-green pigment isolated from the extracellular sheath of cyanobacteria, which demonstrates interesting anti-​inflammatory and anti-​proliferative activities."
