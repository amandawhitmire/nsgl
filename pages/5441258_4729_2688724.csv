12,Abstract:,"While attempting to purify an antimicrobial constituent from the marine sponge ""Petrosia"" sp., the authors isolated a new alkaloid, petrosamine, that has the same carbon skeleton as amphimedine, which is a cytotoxic constituent of the sponge ""Amphimedon"" sp. Petrosamine is remarkable because the colors exhibited by dilute organic or aqueous solutions of the compound are noticeably different. The isolation, spectral properties, and X-ray structure determination of petrosamine are reported here."
