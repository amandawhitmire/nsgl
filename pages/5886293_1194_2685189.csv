10,Abstract:,"Reported here are the first preliminary ""in situ"" observations of the invasive strain of the tropical green seaweed ""Caulerpa taxifolia"" in Huntington Harbor, California. Objectives were to observe the growth habitat of ""C. taxifolia,"" without interfering with the eradication program underway, and to make broad comparisons with ""C. taxifolia"" in other invasions. These measurements of biomass, size structure, and density of ""C. taxifolia"" in Huntington Harbor are the only such data available from the western hemisphere."
