8,Abstract:,"Organized as a tribute to the late Sho Sato, a legal scholar at the University of California at Berkeley, this conference had as its basic purpose the comprehensive consideration of the historical, legal, and policy issues surrounding Pacific Ocean resources. In particular, participants sought to illustrate larger issues in ocean law and the environment by reference to Japan and the United States, both rivals and natural allies on law of the sea issues. The volume is organized broadly into historical perspectives, polar resources, emergence of a new Pacific regime, national and international perspectives, and national power and ocean resources.
