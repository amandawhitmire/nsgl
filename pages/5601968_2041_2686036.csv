9,Abstract:,"Recent experience has provided us with both scientifc and unscientific approaches to coastal policymaking. For example, some scientific critics argue that by-catch in the domestic fishery may be a much bigger problem than drift nets in high seas fishing. Public ownership of most of the resources involved on the marine side supports a thoughtful, precautionary approach to resource development that reflects the latest scientific thinking. At bottom, most coastal policy decisions are resource allocation decisions. Thus factors such as social and national economic conditions can have significant effects on coastal policy decisions. Both scientists and policy-makers should keep in mind these factors and the personal values and beliefs of the decision makers and the people whose lives they affect. For the increased use of science in coastal policy-making, scientists themselves will have to be willing to accept temporary or part-time involvement with policy-making bodies such as boards and commissions."
