12,Abstract:,"At the University of California, Santa Barbara, a collaborative marine chemistry and pharmacology research program has evolved with the purpose of developing and extending knowledge on the pharmacological site and mechanism of action of novel marine products as antiinflammatorâ€‹y agents. A similarity in many of these marine natural products studied thus far is that they can be classified as terpenes and alkaloids derived from the mevalonic acid, amino acid, or shikimic acid pathways. This paper briefly reviews the pharmacological properties of these important inhibitor compounds."
