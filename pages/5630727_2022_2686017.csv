10,Abstract:,"Along the coast of the California Channel Islands, the abundant black abalone ""Haliotis cracherodii"" began to die in large numbers in 1985. This die-off has spread to most of the islands and still continues. Analysis of the changes in abalone abundance at numerous locations suggests that this is the result of an infectious disease spreading slowly from the south side of Santa Cruz Island. However, researchers have found no agent of infection. As with many diseases, warm temperatures acted to increase mortality rates. Results were not consistent with other hypotheses for the decline such as over-â€‹harvesting, pollution, or factors related to physiological stresses by the strong El Nino of 1983-84, including warm temperatures, starvation and competition."
