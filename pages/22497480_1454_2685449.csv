12,Abstract:,"This project investigated and analyzed the major factors contributing to decision-​making and adoption of soil and nutrient management practices by farmers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and upstream watersheds in the Central Valley. In this project, Jessica Rudnick applied a mixed-​methods approach to better understand what drives farmers’ decisions. To collect these data, the fellow conducted semi-structured interviews with farmers and relevant agricultural stakeholders, attended and observed more than 20 public meetings and grower outreach events, including water quality coalition meetings, UC Cooperative Extension field demo days, and industry group conferences. Finally, Rudnick conducted a survey of nearly 5,000 farmers in the Delta and upstream watersheds."
