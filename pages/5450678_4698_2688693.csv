9,Abstract:,"Wherever vulnerable animals live in open three-​dimensional habitats such as open air or water they typically occur in aggregations (members do not typically face in the same direction), polarized schools (members move in the same general diection), or cooperative societies (which involve expression of a variety of social patterns such as cooperative hunting, alloparenting, food sharing, and assistance behavior). The origins and advantages of such aggregations, flocks, schools, and cooperative societies are examined here in the marine context, and a scenario is proposed for their evolution."
