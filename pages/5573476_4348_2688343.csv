10,Abstract:,"There are three classes of cyclic peroxides that are commonly associated with marine sponges. The polyketide peroxides are associated primarily with sponges of the family Plakinidae, most of which give crude extracts that show exceptional antimicrobial and antifungal properties. However, the compounds isolated from these extracts are usually esters or lactones that do not possess the activity of the crude extracts, which is thought to be due to peroxide acids. This paper reports an unusual perlactone, plakinidone, that was isolated from ""Plakortis angulospiculatu​s"", while attempting to obtain the compounds responsible for the antimicrobial and antiviral properties of the crude extract. Plakinidone is the first natural product that incorporates a six- membered perlactone ring."
