11,Abstract:,"There are a number of different routes by which ""p""- nitrophenol (PNP) is released into the environment. Most important, PNP is released into the environment as a product of parathion degradation. Parathion is a widely distributed agricultural pesticide. Since PNP is potentially toxic, its actions in snails may by influenced by its toxicokinetics and biotransformati​on. Therefore, the goals of this investigation were to measure both the kinetic rates and concentrations of PNP and to determine its biotransformati​on in black turban snails (""Tegula funebralis""). PNP was chosen because it may be considered a metabolic probe for similar phenolic compounds. Black turban snails, which reside in coastal regions from British Columbia to Baja California, were chosen to model potential impacts in intertidal molluscs."
