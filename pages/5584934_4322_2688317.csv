11,Abstract:,"Female reproduction in penaeid shrimp is carefully regulated by several different endocrine factors. Their precise modes of action have not yet been fully elucidated. This paper reports on three endocrine factors, each representing a different chemical class of hormones, investigated in the penaeid shrimp ""Sicyonia ingetis"": ecdysteroids, vitellogenesis-â€‹inhibiting hormone and methyl farnesoate."
