11,Abstract:,"The behavior of real scattering surfaces is often specified by measuring the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF), defined as the ratio of the flux scattered into a given direction by a surface under given conditions of illumination to the flux scattered in the same direction by a Lambertian scatterer under identical conditions. The spectral reflectance of different targets will generally yield spectral reflectance curves of different shapes, forming the basis for identification of materials. For example, optical principles developed for the determination of reflectance properties of marine particles facilitate the determination of the BRF of ocean samples. The authors have developed and implemented a system for determining the BRF composed of a Zeiss photomicroscope equipped with a reflective system. This new technique provides the advantages of determination of the BRF for different types of individual and bulk particulates transferred onto an optical embedding medium or collected on an Anopore filter. Abundance and other optical properties (e.g. absorption) of dominant particle types can also be determined by individual particle analysis on the same sample."
