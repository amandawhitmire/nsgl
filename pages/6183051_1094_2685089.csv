15,Abstract:,"Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and Steelhead Trout (O. mykiss) in central California are listed as endangered and threatened, respectively. Recovery of PIT tags implanted in juvenile salmonids by NOAA Fisheries Biologists suggest that predation by birds may limit recovery of Coho and Steelhead. To date, PIT tags have been recovered on breeding sites of Western Gulls (Aï¿½o Nuevo Island) and Caspian Terns (Brooks Island). Tags also have been recovered in the stomachs of Common Mergansers, Double-crested Cormorants, Pied-billed Grebes, and Belted Kingfishers that were captured alive or found dead in Scott and Waddell Creeks. Radio-tracking is being used to locate roosting and breeding areas of birds. Once located, these areas are scanned for the presence of PIT tags, and diet samples are collected. Diet samples and PIT tag recoveries will be used to determine the relative importance of salmonids in diet of these bird species. Radio-tracking also is being used to examine activity patterns of Western Gulls, to determine how much time they spend foraging in areas where salmonids are present. Currently we are conducting bi-monthly stream surveys to record species composition and estimate abundance of piscivorous birds on Scott Creek. Abundance estimates will be combined with published values of metabolic rates of birds and caloric content of juvenile salmonids to estimate the number of salmonids consumed by birds on an annual basis. We expect that although Western Gulls occur in greater numbers than strictly piscivorous birds (i.e. Common Mergansers, Piedbilled Grebes, Kingfishers), they will have less of an impact on the salmon population. I also expect that piscivorous bird populations in Scott Creek are currently limited by the available abundance of juvenile salmonids."
