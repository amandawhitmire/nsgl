13,Abstract:,"The paucity of iron in surface ocean water has spurred a lively debate concerning iron limitation of primary productivity, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms used by marine microorganisms to sequester iron. Terrestrial bacteria use a siderophore-â€‹mediated ferric uptake system. Reported here is the first structure determination of the siderophores from an open- ocean bacterium, alterobactin A and B from ""Alteromonas luteoviolacea"". Alterobactin A has an exceptionally high affinity constant for ferric ion; at least some marine microorganisms may have developed higher-affinity iron chelators as part of an efficient iron-uptake mechanism which is more effective than that of their terrestrial counterparts."
