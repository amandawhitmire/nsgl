9,Abstract:,"The San Pedro Wetfish fleet contains about 31 boats belonging to the San Pedro Fishermen's Cooperative. They vary in length from 60 to 110 feet, with capacities of 50 to 200 tons of fish. While a few of the newer boats are built of steel and aluminum, the majority are constructed of wood. Even the older boats utilize modern technology, and all carry modern radio and electronic equipment. Alth​ough fishing boats have sailed from San Pedro since before World War II, the most important period of the fleet's history dates from the early 1960's. In 1958 the Puretic Powerblock was developed in San Pedro. Around the same time as the acceptance of the powerblock, nets con structed of synthetic fibers were introduced. The synthetic fibers made possible the construction of nets much larger, stronger, and more durable than those of natural fibers. The powerblock made it possible to handle the new, larger nets. The equipment and its use will be -discussed later when the net setting process is described."
