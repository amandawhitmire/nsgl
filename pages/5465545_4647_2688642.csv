9,Abstract:,"The soft-shelled clam, ""Mya arenaria,"" is the third most important commercial clam in the U.S., with a 1984 landed value of 19.8 million. Its range is intertidal to subtidal (to about 200 m depth) along the Atlantic coast from Labrador to South Carolina and locally south to Florida. It has been successfully introduced to Pacific North American waters intermittently from Alaska to California and throughout western Europe. ""Mya"" has been commercially important in New England, particularly Maine and Massachusetts, since colonial times and important hand digging public fisheries still persist and flourish. A second important commercial fishery was developed during the 1950s in the low-salinity chesapeake Bay waters of Maryland with the invention of the escalator clam harvester. This chapter reviews the clam's ecology, predators, important diseases, and culture methods."
