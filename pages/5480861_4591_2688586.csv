12,Abstract:,"Membranes are thought to be a primary target of chilling or freezing damage in cells. The hypothesis that the transition temperature of membrane phospholipids is related to survival of chilling or freezing has not been confirmed by direct measurements of the transition temperature for phospholipids in intact cells. Such transitions have, instead, been measured in phospholipids isolated from the tissue or in isolated membrane vesicles. Here it is demonstrated that transitions in hydrocarbons can be measured rapidly in intact cells and tissues with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Through parallel biochemical studies it is possible to assign a discrete portion of the transition to polar membrane lipids. The paper focuses on how the measurements are made and how they can be interpreted."
