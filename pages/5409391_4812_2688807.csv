8,Abstract:,"During the last forty years different modeling strategies have led to the establishment of many stock assessment techniques in response to one of the dominant challenges posed to fisheries research which is, unquestionably, the accurate determination of stock abundance. Recently, Mangel and Bedar (1985) developed a method which incorporates the time of search as an autonomous parameter in the characterizatio​n of fishing effort. Two applications of a theory for the estimation of stock abundance using search effort are presented, based on an operational definition of the search parameter. Abundance estimates are obtained for South Pacific tuna data sets."
