15,Abstract:,"Big Creek Marine Ecological Reserve (BCER), located off the central California coast, has been closed to fishing since January 1994. Researchers used side scan sonar to collect baseline information on species-habitat relationships, density, and species and size composition of fish inside and outside BCER. Here they compare these variables between two years of continued protection and test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in fish assemblages (numbers and sizes) between BCER and adjacent unprotected areas to the north and south."
