11,Abstract:,"Spatial distributions of DDT, its primary metabolites (DDTs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the water column off the Palos Verdes Peninsula, California were measured using an in situ sampling method. DDT concentrations ranged from 0.6 to 1.14ng/L, and PCBs ranged from 0.06 to 1.14ng/L. The vertical profiles of DDTs and PCBs exponentially decreased with increasing distance form the sea floor. The partitioning characteristics of DDTs and selected PCB congeners indicated a tendency of mobilization from sediment to water. These findings suggest contaminated sediments are a main source of DDT and PCB inputs to the water column."
