12,Abstract:,"The availability of nutrients and trace metals in the oceans is determined largely by terrestrial inputs, from erosion, rivers, and atmospheric deposition. Because biologically important trace metals and nutrients are known to be transported from land to the coastal and open ocean in different amounts, we set out to determine the impact of several terrigenous metals on {\it Synechococcus}, a unicellular cyanobacterium, which is globally ubiquitous, with diverse strains living throughout the world's oceans in coastal and open ocean environments. In our research, we measured the physiological responses (growth rate, photosynthetic efficiency, and cellular composition) of cultured {\it Synechococcus} isolates to various trace metal and nutrient addition treatments. Our preliminary results suggest dissimilar physiological adaptations between coastal and oceanic isolates. In general, coastal isolates were characterized by higher growth rates and greater resistance to metal toxicity than oceanic isolates. The diversity of these physiological responses may influence {\it Synechococcus'} geographical distribution throughout the world's oceans."
