10,Abstract:,"Ocean resources-​-​exploitation of primary resources, processing, rivalries among nations and industries, and environmental impact of the ocean industries-​-​have been neglected recently in the study of economic history. Even the study of marine fisheries industries, for centuries of critical importance to major regions and entire national economies, has waned in prominence, except insofar as economists have seized upon the record of marine fisheries management as material for theorizing on the subject of the `ocean commons.' Many contemporary issues in resource development, economic policy, and environmental science and law now give us very strong reasons, however, to turn with renewed attention to the history of ocean industries and resources. The papers in this collection are grouped into three parts: Atlantic and Pacific ocean regions; history of whaling and sealing; and environmental policies and ocean regimes. Topics cover the areas of marine fisheries development; principles of active marine resources management; ocean resource uses and regulation; and applications of science and new technology to the non-living resources of the ocean. The rising awareness of the profound effects that advanced ocean industry technology has had upon traditional fishing communities worldwide is also addressed, from an anthropologist'​s perspective. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. The development of Spanish commercial fisheries between 1830 and 1930: a general survey. Xoan Carmona pp. 2-14. 2. State support for `useful science': the scientific investigations of the fishery board for Scotland, 1883-1899. Margaret Deacon pp. 15-29. 3. Fisheries protection conventions in the North Sea: from scientific disputes to the foundation of ICES in 1902. Walter Lenz pp. 30-38. 4. The sea as a resource: the case of Devon since 1780. Stephen Fisher pp. 39-48. 5. Pacific resources, technology, and processing: the case of the U.S. salmon industry. Patrick W. O'Bannon, et al. pp. 50-65. 6. Postwar fishery regimes of the Pacific: ocean law, international rivalry, and Japanese economic expansion after 1945. Harry N. Scheiber pp. 66-81. 7. Ocean resources in Brazil 1770-1830. Dale E. Ingmanson pp. 83-97. 8. France's whaling fleets in the Pacific Ocean in the nineteenth century. Annick Foucrier pp. 98-113. 9. The 1893 Bering Sea arbitration: a retrospect.
