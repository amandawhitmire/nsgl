11,Abstract:,"This study examines the effects of temperature stress and various chemical treatments on the stress protein responses of juvenile abalone (""Haliotis rufescens""). Also examined are adult mussel (""Mytilus galloprovincialâ€‹is"") stress protein and cytochrome P450 mRNA levels in response to both thermal stress and exposure to the microbial degradation products of weathered crude oil. Products of such microbial processes appear to be more toxic to a diverse array of aquatic organisms including mysid larvae and shrimp embryos, embryonic and larval herring, and inland silversides."
