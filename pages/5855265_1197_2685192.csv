10,Abstract:,"Over the past three decades, the black abalone, ""Haliotis cracherodii,"" has experienced precipitous declines in abundance over portions of its range in southern and central California. The potential for recovery of these populations is dependent in part on dispersal processes; that is, can distant populations serve as sources of recruits to locales that no longer harbor ""H. cracherodii""? Here the authors report the results of population genetic analyses of seven ""H. cracherodii"" populations sampled along the central California coast. The objective was to determine the pattern and degree of population differentiation over the geographic region where the species remains moderately abundant. The data provide some insight into the genetic structure of black abalone populations and suggest that low levels of interpopulation larval dispersal may prevent rapid recovery of depleted populations despite protection from human harvesting."
