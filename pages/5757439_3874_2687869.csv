10,Abstract:,"Three new cyclic peptides, microscleroderm​ins C-E (3-5), were isolated from two species of lithistid sponges from the Visayan Islands, Philippines. the sponge ""Theonella"" sp. contained peptides 3 and 4, while ""Microscleroder​ma"" sp. contained peptides 4 and 5. Their structures, which feature three unprecedented amino acids, were elucidated using spectroscopic methods and chemical degradation."
