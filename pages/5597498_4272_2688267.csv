14,Abstract:,"At present, the rearing of white sturgeon (""Acipenser transmontanus"") by the aquaculture industry in the U.S. is dependent upon fingerlings produced entirely by the induced spawning of wild-caught broodstock. Cultured males raised from fingerlings reach sexual maturity by 3-4 years of age, but the cultured females do not exhibit sexual maturation even by 8 years of age. Because survival of the sturgeon culture industry depends upon inducing the females to reach sexual maturity, a series of endocrine manipulations of females has been undertaken. Since their sexual maturation is arrested at the previtellogenic stage, researchers have investigated whether the implantation of estrogen, or estrogen in combination with an analog of gonadotropin-â€‹releasing hormone (LHRHa) or carp pituitary (CP) extract, will induce vitellogenesis and ovarian maturation in female sturgeon."
