9,Abstract:,"This paper provides a general overview of the nature and magnitude of human impacts on California's coastal sediment supply. Direct impacts include the reduction of alongshore transport rates as a result of engineering structures such as groins, jettys, or cliff protection. Indirect impacts include reduced sand supply to beaches as a result of residential and transportation development at the foot of coastal cliff systems. These impacts require the development of direct intervention policies as the only sure method of preserving and enhancing the value of California's beach resources."
