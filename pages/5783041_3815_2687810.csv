11,Abstract:,"The objectives of this investigation are to (1) discern systematic and phylogeographic relationships among the species of ""Stizostedion"" and test the three hypotheses of transcontinentaâ€‹l dispersal, (2) compare and elucidate the structure of the mtDNA control region, and (3) evaluate the possible mechanism governing the formation and maintenance of repeats. California brating genetic distances with divergence times supports the hypothesis that ""Stizostedion"" dispersed from Eurasia to North America across a North Pacific Beringial land bridge approximately 4 million years before present. The North American ""S. vitreum"" and ""S canadense"" appear separated by about 2.75 million years, and the Eurasian ""S. lucioperca"" and ""S. volgensis"" are diverged by about 1.8 million years, suggesting that speciation occurred during the late Pliocene."
