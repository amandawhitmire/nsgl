9,Abstract:,"This paper is concerned with the broadening of the discipline of endocrinology and with the propriety of viewing it as the `new' endocrinology, as well as with the continuing utility of the `old' endocrinology. `New' endocrinology recognizes the importance of autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, the indistinct boundary between hormones and growth factors, and the existence of chemical mediation between organisms of the same and different species (pheromones and allelochemics). An overview of the field of biology of chemical mediation is presented, emphasizing that `classical' endocrinology remains a major and vital segment of the field."
