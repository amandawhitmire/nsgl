9,Abstract:,"""Musculista senhousia"" is a soft sediment-​dwelling mussel that has spread anthropogenical​ly from its native Asia to North America, Australia, and Europe. In Mission Bay, San Diego, California, three fish species and two shorebirds were found to prey upon the mussel. This study experimentally tests the ability of predators to limit the success of intertidal populations of the mussel, and reviews available information on ""M. senhousia"" predators within native and invade ecosystems."
