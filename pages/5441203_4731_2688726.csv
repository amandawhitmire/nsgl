9,Abstract:,"This study reports uptake of 14C-alanine by ""Mercenaria mercenaria"" at salinities of 34 and 17 ppt. Although ""Mercenaria"" is less tolerant of low salinity than other bivalve species, it has been reported to survive and grow at salinities as low as 15 ppt. Entry of labeled alanine is compared with net changes in ambient alanine as assessed by HPLC at the two different salinities. The distribution of labeled carbon in the trichloroacetic acid soluble and insoluble fractions of various tissues is reported and related to the FAA content of the tissues at the two salinities studied."
