10,Abstract:,"There has been widespread concern that reduction in density of broadcast spawners by a fishery can have severe effects on reproduction. As fishing decreases density, fertilization efficiency declines, so that reproduction declines more rapidly than indicated by density, producing an Allee effect. However, this potentially precipitous decline in reproduction is not well understood. Here researchers used a simple analytical model to examine the basic effects of the shape of sperm dispersal distribution and spatial distribution of individuals on fertilization and zygote production. They then used a simulation model to determine the effects of: (1) stochastic variability in distribution patterns, and (2) aggregation of adults. Results imply that potential Allee effects at low density in broadcast spawning populations rarely exhibit threshold behavior, and that these Allee effects may be too weak to be detected in stock-â€‹recruitment relationships."
