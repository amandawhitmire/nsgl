9,,"The Merced River Ranch revegetation experiment has been undertaken as a component of the Merced River Corridor Restoration Plan - Phase IV Project (CALFED ERP-02-P12-D), which is intended to evaluate strategies for channel and floodplain restoration within the context of the contemporary flow regime. The Phase IV Project focuses on restoration planning activities on the Merced River Ranch (MRR), located at the uppermost end of the Merced River Dredger Tailings Reach (Figure 1). The Dredger Tailings Reach (DTR) has been severely impacted by historic gold dredger mining and alteration of the natural hydrograph by upstream dams. The reach is also the primary spawning area in the Merced River for fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), an important management species for the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), and potentially steelhead (O. mykiss), which is listed as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. This technical memorandum reports the results of the three-year MRR revegetation experiment and develops revegetation recommendations for inclusion in restoration planning documents prepared for the Phase IV Project."
