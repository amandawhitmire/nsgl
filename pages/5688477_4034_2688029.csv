10,Abstract:,"The irreversible neurotoxic action of ""Beta""-​bungarotoxin (""Beta""-BuTx) can be prevented by preincubation of the toxin with manoalide, a non-steroidal anti-​inflammatory agent. Manoalide was also found to inactivate purified phospholipase A2 and thus prevent hydrolysis of phosphatidylcho​line. PLA2 is a component found in several neurotoxic venoms and is also a rate limiting enzyme important in phospholipid metabolism and prostaglandin synthesis in man."
