9,Abstract:,"Bacteria are the major cause of seafood spoilage. Millions of bacteria are on the surface, on the gills, and in the gut of living fish and shellfish; after harvest, bacteria invade the flesh. Enzymes also cause spoilage; after harvest, they start to digest or break down the flesh, causing it to soften, thus lowering the quality. Oxygen attacks the oils in seafood and causes rancidity, off-odors and off-flavors. High temperatures increase rates of bacterial growth, enzyme activity, and chemical reactions. Low temperatures slow bacterial growth and chemical activity. Seafood shelf life relates directly to storage time and temperature; this fact sheet provides tips on seafood storage."
