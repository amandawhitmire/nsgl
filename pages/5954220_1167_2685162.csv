10,Abstract:,The goal of this work is to analyze the changes observed in the southern part of the California Current System during the 1997-1998 El Nino event with emphasis on the potential mechanisms of oceanic and atmospheric teleconnectionsâ€‹. The authors analyze remotely sensed anomalies of sea surface temperature and sea surface height using Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) statistics. Pronounced seasonal variations are typical of the region so the anomalies over time are used instead of total values to distinguish between typical patterns and the patterns observed during the El Nino event. The Ekman wind drift ('upwelling index') and wind stress curl are analyzed as local meteorological factors that might force the hydrographic variations. Results suggest that the mechanism of oceanic teleconnection (poleward propagation of the coastally trapped downwelling waves) dominated over local wind patterns induced by atmospheric teleconnection.
