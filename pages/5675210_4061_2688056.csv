10,Abstract:,"The effect of heat and enzymatic treatments on physical and moisture barrier properties of soy protein isolate (SPI) edible films were evaluated at three plasticizer levels. Heat treatment produced a film which was smoother and more transparent than unheated SPI films. Heated films had decreased water vapro permeability (WVP) and increased percent elongation at break and percent soluble protein when compared to unheated films. Treatment with horseradish peroxidase provided no further improvement in WVP, but is increased tensile strength and percent protein solubility and decreased percent elongation at break. Enzymatic treatment caused protein degradation in addition to crosslinking."
