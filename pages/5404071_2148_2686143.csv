7,Abstract:,"In recent years, huge oil discoveries have been made off the south/central coast of California in the Santa Barbara Channel and in the Santa Maria Basin. A number of oil development proposals are now being considered by relevant federal, state, and local authorities. The author first characterizes the magnitude of the current oil build-up, placing it in historical perspective. The major issues posed by accelerated development, and the complex of federal, state, and local laws that govern offshore oil extraction, are described. Problems in this regulatory framework and management dilemmas faced by local authorities in coping with the increase in oil activity are analyzed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the need for change in the way the decision-making process is structured, in the flow of federal and state oil revenues, and in patterns of citizen involvement."
