12,Abstract:,"The European green crab, ""Carcinus maenas"", is an introduced marine predator established on the west coast of North America. We conducted laboratory experiments on the host specificity of a natural enemy of the green crab, the parasitic barnacle ""Sacculina carcini,"" to provide information on the safety of its use as a possible biological control agent. Four species of non-target, native California crabs (""Hemi-grapsus oregonensis,"" ""H. nudus,"" ""Pachygrapsus crassipes"" and ""Cancer magister"") were exposed to infective larvae of ""S. carcini"". Settlement by ""S. carcini"" on the four native species ranged from 33 to 53%, compared to 79% for green crabs. Overall, cyprid larvae tended to settle in higher numbers on individual green crabs than on either ""C. magister"" or ""H. oregonensis"". However, for ""C. magister"" this difference was significant for soft-shelled, but not hard-shelled individuals. Up to 29% of the native crabs arrested early infections by melanizing the rootlets of the parasite. Most native and green crabs settled on by ""S. carcini"" became infected, especially when settled on by > 3 cyprids. Infected green crabs died at more than twice the rate of uninfected green crabs. In contrast to green crabs, all infected native crabs died without producing an externa (reproductive sac). At high settlement intensities, infected native crabs frequently exhibited neurological symptoms (twitching, loss of movement) before death. These results indicate that use of ""S. carcini"" as a biological control agent could result in the death of native crabs. The magnitude of this effect would be proportional to the density of infected green crabs in the environment and the probability that cyprids would contact native crabs in the wild. Potential benefits of biological control should be assessed in relation to these potential non-target effects."
