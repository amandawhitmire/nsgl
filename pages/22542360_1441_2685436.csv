14,Abstract:,"This manual introduces commercial fishermen sponsors and apprentices to the program, including roles, responsibilitie​s and benefits of being a host and a student. It describes requirements for entering, advancing and completing the program, with checklists that can be used along the way. We have developed the program with the intention of adapting it to fishing regions throughout the state and elsewhere. It also may serve as a foundation for training programs for other ocean-based careers, such as recreational charter boat operations and aquaculture."
