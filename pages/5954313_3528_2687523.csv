10,Abstract:,"For crustaceans with a well defined annual molting season, such as adult female Dungeness crabs ""Cancer magister"", setal molt staging can, in principle, be used to predict molting destiny of individual crabs. Size-specific predictions of molting probability could, in turn, be useful for estimating mortalities due to molting. In this research, the authors observe and describe the premolt setal stages of female ""C. magister"". They also evaluate the use of molt staging to predict molting destiny in a population, and find that because the duration of the premolt indicator does not exceed the molting season, this approach does not allow reliable estimation of size- specific molting probabilities."
