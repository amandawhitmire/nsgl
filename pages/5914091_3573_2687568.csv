22,Abstract:,"To help select successful locations of marine reserves, scientists developed a series of criteria that allow preliminary evaluation of candidate sites according to their relative biological values in advance of the application of socioeconomic criteria. The scheme enables the assessment of sites according to their biodiversity, the processes that underpin that diversity, and the processes that support fisheries and provide a spectrum of other services important to people. Criteria that capture biodiversity values include biogeographic representation, habitat representation and heterogeneity, and presence of a threatened species. Criteria that capture sustainability of biodiversity and fishery values include presence of exploitable species, vulnerable life stages, links among ecosystems, and provision of ecosystem services to people. Criteria measuring human and natural threats enable candidate sites to be eliminated from consideration if risks are too great, but also help prioritize among sites where threats can be mitigated by protection."
