10,Abstract:,"The reproductive composition and genetic diversity of populations of the red seaweed ""Lithothrix aspergillum"" Gray (O. Corallinales) were studied at three southern California sites and at a fourth site in northern California. Sexually reproducing populations were confined to southern California. Diploid individuals were numerically dominant over haploid (gametophytic) individuals at all sites. Very high genetic differentiation was obtained between northern and southern California populations separated by 700-760km. The authors genetic and reproductive data suggests that the ""L. aspergillum"" population from northern California is sustained by perennation, vegetative propagation, or asexual reproduction by biospores and may represent an isolated remnant or a population established by a founder event."
