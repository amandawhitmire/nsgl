8,Abstract:,"About 72 species of ""Sebastes"" are found along the eastern Pacific coast of North America, some of which are heavily exploited by both commercial and sport fisheries. Because of the large number of species, the identification of early life stages has progressed slowly. The objectives of this study were to rear the larvae of four species of rockfish (""Sebastes mystinus"", ""S. carnatus"", ""S. atrovirens"", and ""S. rastrelliger""), and to describe the larvae using morphometric measurements, pigmentation patterns, and head spination. Pigmentation was the most useful feature for identification purposes."
