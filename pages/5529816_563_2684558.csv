9,Abstract:,"""Strongylocentr​otus franciscanus"" is fished commercially from British Columbia to Baja California. By 1987, this was the second most valuable fishery in California. With the eventual elimination of unfished stocks statewide, and potentially throughout the range of the fishery, the alternatives are a reduced harvest or stock enhancement. The success of all attempts to enhance benthic invertebrate stocks by the release of hatchery-reared juveniles is reviewed, as well as other methods relevant to sea urchins. The implications of the American tradition of open-access fisheries for stock enhancement are also discussed."
