14,Abstract:,"The rugged topography and high rainfall intensity typical of the main Hawaiian Islands results in rapidly changing hydrographic conditions that present an opportunity to study the spatial and temporal evolution of material as it travels through the watershed to the ocean. Because the island of Oahu has been extensively urbanized, transport of suspended particulate matter during storms represents an important vehicle for the mobilization of anthropogenic material deposited throughout the watersheds during the past half century. The authors of this paper established a network of automatic sampling and water quality monitoring stations in streams of high-relief watersheds on Oahu to evaluate the variability in material transported to estuaries and the coastal ocean during low flow and storm conditions. Objectives included quantifying storm-driven material fluxes to the ocean and elucidating natural and anthropogenic trace element contributions therein."
