On February 20, 1969, the Western Oil and Gas Association was awarded a research grant to the Allan Hancock Foundation, University of Southern California, to study the biological and oceanographical effects of oil spillage in the Santa Barbara Channel following the 1969 blowout. The work herein was also partially supported by a Grant (GH-89) from the National Sea Grant Program, U.S. Department of Commerce to the University of Southern California."
