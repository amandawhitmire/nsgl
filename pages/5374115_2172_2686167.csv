9,Abstract:,"During the years 1981-1983, 12,037 adult female Dungeness crabs in northern California were tagged and released. The project required that substantial reliance be placed on tag recovery data from the northern California commercial fishery. Analyses of tag recovery data were seriously confounded by sampling biases. In particular (1) movement analyses were biased by temporal and spatial departures of fishing effort from random or uniform distributions; and (2) estimation of annual molting probabilities was biased by commercial crab trap size selection and loss of tags through molts. The intention of this paper is to illustrate the nature and potential impacts of those biases and, where possible, to point out some steps which could or should be taken to adjust for or minimize them."
