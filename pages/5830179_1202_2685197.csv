10,Abstract:,"This report is the result of a technical review of the studies conducted during and after the closure of Huntington Beach (Orange County, California) in the summer of 1999. For a two-month period, large sections of Huntington Beach were closed due to excessive levels of indicator bacteria in the water; it represents one of the largest known losses in the U. S. to recreational activities and revenues due to bacterial contamination. The University of Southern California Sea Grant Program, at the request of the Orange County Sanitation District, convened an independent review of the scientific studies and management actions that were undertaken. Ten experts from various disciplines were invited to participate in a three- day workshop. This report is a written summary of a public oral report given by the panel at the end of the three-day workshop. It will be useful to technicians and managers in identifying key areas that should be addressed both before and during a contamination event. Studies and procedures that will facilitate source identification and mitigation are also recommended."
