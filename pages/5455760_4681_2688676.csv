10,Abstract:,"Certain sugars, particularly trehalose, dramatically alter physical properties of dry phospholipids in ways that mimic the presence of water, and thus are capable of preserving the integrity of dry liposomes and membranes. Careful measurements of the residual water contents in the dry samples are reported here. Results indicate that the stabilization does not require retention of residual amounts of water in the dry trehalose-â€‹phospholipid preparations. Similar studies with other sugars show a relationship between the amount of sugar interacting with the lipid and the ability of the same sugar to stabilize dry liposomes."
