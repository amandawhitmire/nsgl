9,Abstract:,"The Memorial Lecture Program at the University of Southern California was developed in 1987. It honors distinguished contributors to marine transportation, bringing to the public their thoughts in the form of an annual lecture series. This first lecture honors the man for whom the lecture series and an endowment are named. Paul Hall was respected in all quarters of the marine transportation field. Throughout his working career he sought to bring together the industry, to improve working conditions, to meet the challenge of foreign competition, and to advise government on how the U.S. Merchant Marine might be revitalized."
