12,Abstract:,"A month-long study at Huntington Beach CA in fall 2006 explored the connections between physical dynamics and chlorophyll-a (Chl) fluorescence, nutrients, phytoplankton taxa and abundance in the nearshore and surfzone. In addition to numerous moorings and profiling instruments, a novel jetski platform provided high spatial resolution maps (m to km) of surface Chl and temperature. Over the course of the 1 month deployment, wind-driven upwelling carried cold, nutrient rich water to within 15 m depth, where the M2 internal tide episodically pushed this water toward the surfzone, mixing it upwards. A bloom of Lingulodinium polyedrum formed a dense subsurface layer 10 m below the surface that was repeatedly forced to the surface by internal oscillations. Striking cross-shore variation in phytoplankton abundance and community composition were observed, with dinoflagellates dominating onshore of the 15 m depth contour, and diatoms dominating in deeper areas over a cross-shore distance of 8 km. This integrated cross-shore perspective indicates that these shallow-water events may carry significant implications for the growth"
