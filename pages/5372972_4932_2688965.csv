8,Abstract:,"At least three time-dependent factors may affect intestinal proline influx rates in coho salmon: (1) the timing of seawater entry; (2) the length of seawater adaptation; and (3) the season. Environmental cues which synchronize osmotic preadaptation and seawater entry during smoltification may optimize the interaction of these time-dependent factors leading to increased intestinal nutrient absorption rates and rapid growth in seawater. By describing the changes in proline influx during smoltification and seawater adaptation, the present studies represent one approach to this aspect of intestinal adaptation."
