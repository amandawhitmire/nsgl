9,Abstract:,"Investigations were conducted on the gametes from a primitive vertebrate, the white sturgeon (""Acipenser transmontanus"")â€‹. Early reports indicated that sturgeon sperm possessed acrosomes and exhibited acrosomal processes while the eggs possessed not one, but numerous, micropyles. The presence of acrosomes in the sperm and micropyles in the eggs of sturgeon seems to contradict many ideas on sperm and acrosomal evolution. In this paper, the authors describe the fine structure of the white sturgeon sperm and its acrosomal reaction, the physiological parameters of this event and the egg envelope component that induces the reaction."
