11,Abstract:,"Nitrate reductase (NR) activity and nitrogen incorporation rates were compared in cultures of ""Thalassiosira pseudonana"" that had been: (1) grown on light/dark cycles, (2) starved of nitrogen, or (3) grown on (or in the presence of) ammonium. The goal of these experiments was to determine whether these conditions affected the applicability of NR activity as an index of nitrate incorporation. There is also the issue of whether the relationship is applicable to natural phytoplankton assemblages. The authors chose to apply the NR assay to natural assemblages, and to compare patterns of diel periodicity and ammonium inhibition with those found in cultures. The NR assay was used in a preliminary study of natural assemblages of phytoplankton in Monterey Bay, California, during a post-upwelling diatom bloom. Diel periodicity in NR activity was virtually identical to that found in laboratory cultures. Ammonium inhibition on a time scale similar to that seen in culture was also recorded. These preliminary results are promising for the use of NR activity to estimate rates of nitrate incorporation in field populations of phytoplankton."
