8,Abstract:,"Squid have a one-year life cycle, making them highly susceptible to overfishing. In his presentation, Roger Hanlon, senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory's Marine Resources Center, discussed the potential impacts of fishing on squid mate selection, egg- laying, and even the viability of the egg capsules. Hanlon's current research in Monterey Bay, California, shows that squid are being exploited at an unprecedented rate. With Woods Hole Sea Grant funding, Hanlon and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution engineer Ken Foote designed an innovative project using sonar to locate and map the distribution and abundance of squid eggs. Hanlon's presentation also included exciting video footage and slides from ongoing research that could help improve management of the squid fishery."
