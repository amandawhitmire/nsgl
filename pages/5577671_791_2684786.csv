12,,This chapter explores several management issues facing California ports and examines policy options for state government in this area. Five port management issues are raised: cooperation vs. competition among the ports; alternative waterfront land uses; port capacity and the potential for growth; harbor dredging needs; and resulting financial dilemmas for port enterprise. Examination of these issues leads to consideration of statewide policy in three areas: port growth and environmental impacts; regional port planning in response to demand; and investment possibilities for California in its seaport industry.
