11,Abstract:,"This review article describes three creative collaborations to improve marine fisheries management in California. The cases highlight the involvement of the California Sea Grant Extension Program (SGEP) in (1) implementing comprehensive marine-​management legislation, (2) helping the sea urchin industry identify goals and techniques to achieve them, and (3) using extension methodologies to enhance socioeconomic research related to management of the Dungeness crab fishery. Critical components of SGEP methods were trust, independence, nonadvocacy, a science-based approach, and effective communication. These characteristics are seldom found together in contentious fisheries-​management situations. This work demonstrates how extension programs can partner with constituents and agencies to improve the management and research process; this approach can be applied to the broad range of natural-​resource issues facing the state."
