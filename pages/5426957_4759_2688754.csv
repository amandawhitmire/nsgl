10,Abstract:,"Since the first artificial spawning of white sturgeon in 1980, sturgeon have been raised in California with commercial salmonid rations. Body weight gain of the resulting progeny was monitored; however, no carcass composition information was collected until mid-1983. The objective of this study was to determine the carcass proximate composition of cultured white sturgeon and the effects of age on the composition. As a basis for comparison, wild white sturgeon of similar age and a representative cultured fish species, rainbow trout (""Salmon gairdnerii""), reared under similar conditions were analyzed for their proximate compositions."
