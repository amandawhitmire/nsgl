10,Abstract:,"The authors previously reported the isolation of several diterpenes from a sponge of the genus ""Dendrilla"" collected from a marine lake in Palau. This sponge has now been reclassified as a member of the genus ""Chelonaplysill​a"". Four novel alkaloids derived from tryptophan and tyrosine subunits have been isolated from the sponge. Chelonin A and C are the first natural products incorporating a 2,6-​disubstituted morpholine ring. Chelonin A, chelonin B, and bromochelonin B exhibited antimicrobial activity against ""Bacillus subtilis"", and chelonin A also showed in-vivo antiinflammator​y activity."
