8,Abstract:,"Although Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") catch records exhibit considerable interannual fluctuations throughout its range (central California to Alaska), most research has been in cyclic variations along northern California, Oregon and Washington. Three categories of mechanisms have been proposed as the cause of these cycles: (1) predator-prey interactions, (2) density-â€‹dependent recruitment, and (3) cyclic environmental variables. Research on this species over the past ten years can be viewed as an attempt to disprove various hypothetical mechanisms within each of these classes. Evidence relevant to each proposed mechanism is reviewed here. The possibility that the cause of cycles involves a combination of mechanisms from both the second and third category is then evaluated."
