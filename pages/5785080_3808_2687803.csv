13,Abstract:,"The authors have cloned and characterized the cDNA coding for Lustrin A, a newly described matrix protein from the nacreous layer of the shell and pearl produced by the abalone, ""Haliotis rufescens"". The amino acid sequence shows similarity to proteins of two extracellular matrix superfamilies. The arrangement of alternating cysteine-rich and proline-rich domains is similar to that found in frustulins. The modular structure suggests that it is a multifunctional protein, whereas the occurrence of related sequences suggests it is a member of a multiprotein family."
