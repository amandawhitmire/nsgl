12,Abstract:,"The Atlantic tarpon (""Megalops atlanticus"") is believed to be a long-lived fish. A longevity of 55 years was estimated from growth zones in sagittal otoliths of a wild female tarpon. The annual periodicity of the growth zones used to estimate age was validated by using oxytetracycline up to an age of 9 yr in captive fish, but extrapolation of these results to older, wild fish, however, is fallible. To circumvent the potential problems of otolith interpretation and to independently determine age, an application of the radiometric aging technique by using the 210Pb:226 Ra disequilibrium in sagittal otolith cores of Atlantic tarpon was performed, and the results are discussed in the context of existing estimated growth parameters."
