10,Abstract:,"Four aromatic alkaloids, ningalins A-D (1-4), three of which possess new carbon skeletons, were isolated from an undescribed ascidian of the genus ""Didemnum"" collected in Western Australia near Ningaloo Reef. The structures of these new alkaloids were elucidated by interpretation of overall spectral data and by 2D NMR correlation methods. Because the ningalins are related to other metal binding catechols, it is conceivable that they too participate in the metal chelation phenomena characteristic of this class of marine invertebrates."
