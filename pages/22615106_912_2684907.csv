16,Abstract:,"The toxic diatom genus Pseudo-​nitzschia produces environmentally damaging harmful algal blooms (HABs) along the U.S. west coast and elsewhere, and a recent ocean warming event coincided with toxic blooms of record extent. This study examined the effects of temperature on growth, domoic acid toxin production, and competitive dominance of two Pseudo-​nitzschia species from Southern California. Growth rates of cultured P. australis were maximal at 23C ($0.8d1), similar to the maximum temperature recorded during the 2014–2015 warming anomaly, and decreased to $0.1 d1 by 30C. In contrast, cellular domoic acid concentrations only became detectable at 23C, and increased to maximum levels at 30C. In two incubation experiments using natural Southern California phytoplankton communities, warming also increased the relative abundance of another potentially toxic local species, P. delicatissima. These results suggest that both the toxicity and the competitive success of particular Pseudo-​nitzschia spp. can be positively correlated with temperature, and therefore there is a need to determine whether harmful blooms of this diatom genus may be increasingly prevalent in a warmer future coastal ocean."
