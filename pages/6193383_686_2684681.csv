9,Abstract:,"Copper-based antifouling paints are under regulatory scrutiny in California for elevating dissolved copper levels in boat basins. A TMDL program was approved for Shelter Island Yacht Basin in San Diego Bay. Other boat basins face similar TMDLs; therefore, a statewide approach would facilitate wide ranging solutions. State and federal agencies are coordinating on antifouling paint and water quality issues. California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) is sharing data with USEPA; both are reevaluating registration of copper-based antifouling paints. If water quality impacts of these paints are not adequately addressed by CDPR, the California State Water Resources Control Board and Regional Water Quality Control Boards will coordinate to develop a state policy. The Copper Antifouling Paint Workgroup of state agencies and University of California Sea Grant Extension Program (UCSGEP) meet regularly to communicate on antifouling paint and water quality issues. Coordination is needed to resolve conflicts between policies to control hull-borne, aquatic invasive species (AIS) in hull fouling and reduce antifouling paint pollution. Nontoxic coatings need frequent cleaning, but the National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005 discourages in-water hull cleaning. Restrictions on copper-based antifouling paints could exacerbate invasions or improve resistance of native species as coastal water quality improves. To address this, UCSGEP convened a Workshop on Managing Hull Transport of AIS that yielded research, practice, education and policy recommendations to control AIS while improving water quality. Continued communication and coordination of policy makers and stakeholders would help to resolve water quality and AIS policy conflicts."
