10,Abstract:,"Methyl farnesoate (MF) is a sesquiterpenoid that is synthesized by crustaceans and is structurally similar to the insect juvenile hormones. In order to investigate the biological significance of MF metabolism, the authors have developed two rapid methods for measuring MF esterase activity. The first is a radiochemical partition assay that utilizes an authentic substrate. The second, spectrophotometâ€‹ric method, is less specific for MF esterases than the partition assay but is less time consuming and nonradioactive, and provides kinetic information."
