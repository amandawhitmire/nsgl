12,Abstract:,"Previous studies of ""Macrocystis pyrifera"" gametophyte biology have been extended in order to understand the potential impacts of an environmental contaminant on the haploid stage. This study determined the time course of DNA synthesis during early development (from the time of zoospore release) as well as the effects of arsenic (as arsenates) on DNA synthesis, nuclear division, and nuclear translocation. The effects of arsenates on gametophytic development were investigated under light and dark conditions which would be indicative of the mechanism of toxicant action."
