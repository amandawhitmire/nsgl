8,Abstract:,"The Maine Lobster Promotion Council and Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe have called on the FDA to stop allowing restaurants to market langostino as lobster. Langostino, Spanish for “prawn,” refers to a number of shellfish species that are also called “squat lobsters.” The issue stems from a June 2005 lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court that unsuccessfully sought to prevent a California chain, Rubio’s Restaurants Inc., from promoting a langostino-​containing burrito as a lobster burrito. “Use of this term is misleading to consumers and unfairly affiliates langostino with actual lobster to the detriment of the lobster industry in Maine,” Snowe wrote to acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, requesting a reversal of the decision to allow the term “langostino lobster” to be used on restaurant menus."
