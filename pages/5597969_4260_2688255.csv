10,Abstract:,"Leukotrienes (LT) are biologically active metabolites of arachidonic acid that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many allergic and inflammatory diseases such as asthma, arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Fuscoside (FSD), a gorgonian derivative, is a potent and long-lasting anti- inflammatory drug that selectively inhibits leukotriene production in murine models of inflammation. In this study, the effects of FSD on the lipoxygenase pathways in human polymorphonucle​ar leukocytes are explored in order to better understand the mechanism of action of this novel drug."
