11,Abstract:,"This article describes the use of quantitative PCR for measuring bacterial abundance in environmental samples. One approach is the use of an internal PCR standard constructed to be the same size and have the same sequence as the primary amplification target, but differing from the target by 2-3 bases. The second approach described here is the use of Taqman technology with a dual labeled oligonucleotide probe that binds internal to the PCR primers."
