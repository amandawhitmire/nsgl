11,Abstract:,"Ceratomyxosis is a disease of trout and salmon in the Pacific northwest caused by the myxozoan ""Ceratomyxa shasta"". Ceratomyxosis has caused the disease and deaths in hatchery and wild salmonids, both juvenile and adult. There is no known trea tment for ceratomyxosis, hence prevention and management are paramount. Management involves stocking resistant species or strains wherever waters are known to harbor the infective stage, and releasing hatchery fish during periods of low or no infe ctivity. The objectives of this study were to determine the geographic and seasonal occurrence of the infective stage of ""Ceratomyxa shasta"" in California. Such information is essential to management of resident and anadromous salmonids."
