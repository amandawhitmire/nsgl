9,Abstract:,"This study makes a direct comparison of spatial patterns of northern anchovy and Pacific sardine eggs at the scale of 0.75-2.5 km, using samples from two locations in the Southern California Bight. The ultimate goal is to address the relationship of spawning behavior to spawning habitat and the dramatic fluctuations in population size exhibited by sardine and anchovy species. These changes in population size are accompanied by changes in life history that are likely to affect the behavior of spawning adults. Consequently, spatial autocorrelation analyses of sardine and anchovy eggs sampled at the scales relevant to spawning schools and shoals have the potential to reveal interesting relationships among spawning behavior, population size, and concurrent environmental conditions."
