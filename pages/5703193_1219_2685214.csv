14,Abstract:,"A coccidian of the genus ""Pseudoklossia"" occurs in the kidneys of abalone, ""Haliotis"" spp., throughout waters off California. Parasites are often numerous in renal tissues, and developmental stages include oocysts, macrogametes, microgametocyteâ€‹s, and meronts. Renal coccidian infections occur in uninfected abalone after exposure to water occupied previously by infected animals. The life cycle of this parasite appears to be monoxenous and the coccidian evokes no host inflammatory response. Researchers have named this coccidian ""Pseudoklossia haliotis"" sp. n. and describe the morphologic characteristics of the endogenous stages and oocysts. This represents only the seventh named species described from the genus."
