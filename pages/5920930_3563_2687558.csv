12,Abstract:,"Changes in wave breaking owing to variations in wave height and direction along curving coastlines, irregular bathymetry, and built structures are believed to cause complex surf zone circulation, including rip currents and mean along-shore currents that can change direction both across the surf zone and along a depth contour. Here, laboratory and field tests of drifter designed to measure surf zone circulation are described. Drifter positions accurate to within a few meters are estimated in real time, and more accurate positions are estimated from postprocessed, internally logged data."
