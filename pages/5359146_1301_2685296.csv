11,,"Fishery management measures are often proposed in the absence of adequate information on their economic impact. This study, done in cooperation with the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations and the California Seafood Institute, addresses the problem by developing (1) an economic database for the fishing and seafood industries, and (2) a mathematical model which shows the interdependenci​es of these industries with the rest of the California economy. Sources included mail surveys and extensive face-to-face interviews."
