13,Abstract:,"Late Holocene stratigraphy representing rapid episodic subsidence due to large magnitude earthquakes is found in synclines of Humboldt Bay, California. These synclines are onshore structures associated with the Cascadia subduction zone fold and thrust belt, which bends eastward in Northern California. In the axes of the synclines, repeated sequences of intertidal muds overlying tidal-marsh to wetland peat deposits represent episodes of rapid submergence followed by gradual emergence. Observations of the contacts between the peats and overlying muds are abrupt (<1 cm). The rapid submergence is interpreted to represent coseismic subsidence associated with large magnitude earthquakes."
