12,Abstract:,"Surface plasmon resonance technology allows 'real-time' measurements of protein-DNA binding, and thus offers the potential for facile and direct description of binding and release kinetics. The work presented here describes topoisomerase I-DNA interactions using a surface plasmon resonance anlalyzer, the Pharmacia BIAcore 2000 biosensor. DNA association appears to be complex. Mg2+ was found to increase both disassociation rate constants and may have a detectable effect on topoisomerase I-DNA association. DNA base content did not affect disassociation rate constants or the rate of association."
