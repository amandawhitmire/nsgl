11,Abstract:,"In this paper, the carbohydrate composition of sensitive corn and tolerant ""Pennisetum typhoides"" pollen has been characterized; sucrose, the sole soluble carbohydrate present at high concentration, was considerably higher in ""Pennisetum"" pollen. Results of phospholipid analyses on the two species show no significant differences between them. The extent to which sucrose, trehalose and myoinositol were able to preserve during drying large unilamellar vesicles prepared from pollen phospholipids also was studied. Sucrose is likely to be responsible for stabilization of membranes in pollen that is tolerant to desiccation."
