17,Abstract:,"Ecological connectivity can influence the distributions of diversity and productivity among ecosystems, but relationships among multiple marine ecosystems remain relatively uncharacterized​. Sandy beaches are recipient ecosystems that support coastal food webs through deposits of drift macrophytes (wrack), and serve as test cases for exploring within-​seascape connectivity. We present results from the first comprehensive survey of geographic and temporal patterns of wrack cover and composition on beaches along the North Central Coast of California and test the role of local donor ecosystems and physical factors in predicting wrack distribution. We surveyed wrack at 17 beaches in August 2010, and monthly at a subset of 10 beaches for 13 months. We estimated explanatory variables of (1) local donor ecosystem cover (kelp forests, rocky intertidal, and bays and estuaries), (2) biomass transport, and (3) beach morphology. Regression analyses were used to evaluate relationships among the cover of six key wrack categories and the explanatory variables above, for two time periods. We found persistent geographic variation in wrack composition and detected significant relationships between wrack cover and cover of local donor ecosystems for five of the six wrack categories (Nereocystis, Zostera, Postelsia, mixed red algae, and mixed brown algae). Transport mechanisms (wind exposure, swell exposure) or attributes of the recipient ecosystem (beach width, beach slope) explained additional spatial variation for three of the six wrack categories (Zostera, Phyllospadix, and mixed red algae). Our results support the concept of considering ecological connectivity (particularly the role of donor ecosystems upon which recipient ecosystems rely) in the design and management of protected areas"
