14,Abstract:,Streptococcus iniae is a major fish pathogen producing invasive infections such as meningoencephalâ€‹itis that result in major economic losses in aquaculture worldwide. There is currently little understanding of the phenotypic characteristics of this pathogen that promote virulence. Development of in vitro models of S. iniae virulence can provide insight to the pathogenesis of infection in vivo.
