14,Abstract:,"The native oyster species, Crassostrea corteziensis, has been cultured in the Boca de Camichin estuary in Nayarit, Mexico for over 35 years. Oysters are grown suspended from floating rafts and culture. Recent rapid development without planning or limitation, has led to concern amongst growers as to the carrying capacity of this heavily utilized body of water. A study to estimate carrying capacity has begun. The results of water sampling to determine seston concentrations (Total Particulate Matter-TPM) and the organic fraction of seston (Particulate Organic Matter-POM) are presented here. Water sampling was conducted between February and June, 2008. Three transects were sampled: at the mouth of the estuary, in the central part of the oyster growing area, and the interior estuary area. At each of the transects, measurements were taken at 1.2 m and 2.5 m depth from the center of the estuary channel and close to the two banks. Sampling was repeated at ebb and flood tides. The concentration of TPM varied from 9.2 in February to 109 in June with a mean of 39.18 The PMO varied between 2.06 in February to 6.59 in March with a mean of 3.82 There was no significant difference in concentrations of TPM nor PMO during the two tidal stages (Table 1). These concentrations are higher than found at another oyster (Crassostrea gigas) growing area in Bahia San Quintin in Baja California, Mexico (Garc2004) where the average POM concentration was 1.9 g/ml in an area where 1,913 tons of oysters are produced annually. POM as a percentage of seston (TPM) was lower however, in Boca de Camichin (3.1 to 22.4%) than at San Quintin (17.8 to 25.5%). The higher proportion of POM may influence the oysters assimilation rate."
