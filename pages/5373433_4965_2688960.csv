9,Abstract:,"Various artificial collectors were tested to obtain spat of the purple-hinge rock scallop ""Hinnites multirugosus"". These included plastic-mesh onion bags filled with nylon monofilament (gillnet), monofilament dipped in cement, chaparral sticks, and a combination of sticks and empty scallop shells. The collectors were placed near a rock scallop population in Mission Bay, San Diego, CA. Spat recruitment was greatest in gillnet collectors immersed for 3 to 4 months between late March and July. Numerous spat of the blue mussel ""Mytilus edulis"" and the wide-eared scallop ""Leptopecten latiauratus"" also settled in the gillnet collectors."
