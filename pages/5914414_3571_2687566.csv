20,Abstract:,"Here scientists provide a framework for the designation of marine reserves that unifies the central aims of conservation and fishery management, while also meeting other human needs (e.g., maintenance of coastal water quality, shoreline protection, and recreational opportunities). In this scheme, candidate sites for reserves are evaluated against 12 criteria, employed in a particular order. Measurement is critical to the effective application of the criteria and this paper provides detailed guidance on how to quantify the value of candidate sites according to each criterion."
