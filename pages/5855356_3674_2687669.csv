12,Abstract:,"""Strongylocentr​otus franciscanus"" is the major sea urchin species fished on the west coast of North America and has become a candidate for aquaculture as populations have declined. Because feed costs are a major portion of operating costs in any form of intensive aquaculture, accurate estimates of the effect of ration on production are vital for cost-effective feeding. Here the authors report the effect of ration on gonad production in ""S. franciscanus"" and on rates of ingestion and absorption to give insight into the processes involved."
