9,Abstract:,"During the preliminary steps of developing a HACCP plan, the flow diagram is an important tool. While it is not mandated by seafood HACCP regulation, the flow diagram can provide a clear, simple description of the steps involved in the processing of a fishery product and its associated ingredients from landing to distribution. The generic flow diagrams provided here are two examples useful during the preliminary steps of developing a HACCP plan relating to the control of smoked fish."
