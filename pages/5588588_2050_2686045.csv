11,Abstract:,"Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins and domoic acid are naturally occurring marine toxins produced by phytoplankton. Pollution does not seem to influence toxin production. Marine animals that filter their food from seawater may accumulate these toxins, which don't appear to harm the animals, but people or some animals eating toxic seafoods may become poisoned. PSP toxins and domoic acid are powerful nerve poisons that have no taste or odor; there is no visible difference between toxic and safe seafoods. Cleaning seafoods in many cases will not remove the toxins, nor does cooking destroy them. This fact sheet describes California's monitoring program and harvesting quarantines."
