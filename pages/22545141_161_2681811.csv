18,Abstract:,"Between June 2015 and February 2019, the Sonoma County Water Agency (Sonoma Water) and California Sea Grant continued implementation of the Coastal Monitoring Plan (CMP, Adams et al. 2011) in the Russian River Watershed. During this contract period, we further refined the Russian River sample frame and completed four seasons of data collection, adding to a long-term dataset which began in 2013 when CMP implementation first began in the Russian River watershed. Although the sample frame for the Russian River was largely defined prior to this grant period via desktop exercises, it remained incomplete because field reconnaissance had not yet been conducted on a high proportion of reaches to confirm that they contain salmonid habitat. Multiple iterations of the sample frame (along with annual GRTS draws) occurred as we conducted reconnaissance and added and removed reaches. In 2016, we finalized the GRTS draw and continued to attribute each reach within the frame with species and life stage as field reconnaissance occurred. As of February 2019, we have completed juvenile and adult Coho Salmon and adult Chinook Salmon stratification, with stratification by juvenile and adult steelhead well underway. In addition, rotating panels were developed for both Coho and steelhead adult strata. Life cycle monitoring was conducted in Dry Creek for Coho Salmon and steelhead and on the mainstem Russian River for Chinook Salmon. A combination of dual-frequency identification ​ sonar (DIDSON), passive integrated transponder (PIT) detection systems and video was used to count returning adults, and spawner surveys were conducted in all suitable and accessible habitat within the Dry Creek watershed. We used downstream migrant traps on mainstem Dry Creek, Mill Creek (a tributary entering Dry Creek downstream of the Dry Creek trap) and at Sonoma Water’s Mirabel dam site on the mainstem Russian River to count Coho, steelhead and Chinook smolts. We combined trap data with data from stationary PIT tag detection systems and/or used mark-recapture models to estimate smolt abundance. Because a significant portion of steelhead smolts migrate during the winter when traps cannot be operated, we used an alternative, pre-smolt abundance modeling approach to estimate steelhead smolt abundance that was based on summer electrofishing and winter PIT antenna operation in Dry Creek and Mill Creek."
