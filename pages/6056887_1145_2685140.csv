8,Abstract:,"Spatial management is currently an important issue in fisheries, and a central question for managers is how fishing effort will respond to marine reserves and other types of closures. This paper develops a panel Tobit model to analyze the influence of spatial and dynamic factors on decisions about where and when to fish. The model includes autocorrelation​. A simulated maximum likelihood approach is used to compute parameter estimates and conduct hypothesis tests, including an analysis of covariance to detect sources of individual heterogeneity. The model is used with ten panels of data, representing fleets from ports in California's groundfish trawl fishery. Results show that ex-vessel prices are the most important explanatory variable in the model, and affect the spatial distribution of fishing effort. Regulatory variables, in the form of limits on landings for some species, are also important in most cases, and these reveal both spatial and temporal effects of past regulations. Dynamic factors such as autocorrelation​, or effects of past fishing effort in a particular area on current effort, are also significant at several ports, but spatial interactions in effort are important in only two cases. Results from the analysis of covariance show that using pooled time series data to analyze effects of spatial management is acceptable practice in some cases."
