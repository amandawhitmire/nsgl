8,Abstract:,"The regulation of interrenal activity during smoltification has received little attention, despite the intriguing temporal relationship between the smoltification-â€‹associated increases in plasma thyroxine and cortisol levels in coho salmon. A static incubation system for assessing interrenal activity based on cortisol production in response to ACTH stimulation was developed in order to investigate changes in interrenal responsiveness to ACTH during salmon smoltification and their relationship to the patterns of plasma thyroxine and cortisol."
