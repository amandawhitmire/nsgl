10,Abstract:,"Held in 1999 at Virginia Beach, Virginia, ""The National Symposium on Catch and Release in Marine Recreational Fisheries,"" represented the third major symposium to address catch and release as a fisheries management tool. Approximately 130 persons attended, representing nearly all U.S. coastal states as well as Canada, Norway, Bermuda, and Australia. The steering committee strived to organize a forum in which catch and release issues could be examined and debated from the various perspectives of fisheries scientists, social scientists, extension leaders, educators, fisheries managers, charter boat captains, marine fishing media and tackle industry leaders, and angling groups to name a few."
