11,Abstract:,"A variety of genetic sex determination systems have been reported in fish. Recently, synaptonemal complex surface- spreading techniques have been used to address questions related to fish cytogenetics and have permitted the direct identification of heteromorphic sex chromosomes in fish. In this report, the technique was used to visualize the process of chromosome synapsis in white sturgeon spermatocytes. Results suggest that the male is not the heterogametic sex in these fish."
