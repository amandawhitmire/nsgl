13,Abstract:,"The role of ecdysteroids in modulating exoskeletal growth during the moult cycle of Crustacea has been well described. However, little is known about the action of ecdysteroids at the level of gene transcription and regulation in Crustacea. This paper reports the cloning of an ecdysteroid responsive gene, HHR3, a potential ""Manduca sexta"" MHR3 homologue in the American lobster, ""Homarus americanus"". Results provide novel evidence for an ecdysteroid responsive gene in a crustacean that has many similarities to MHR3 in ""Manduca"" and DHR3 in ""Drosophila melanogaster."" This raises the question of whether a similar cascade of ecdysteroid responsive genes exist in other members of Arthropoda such as the Crustacea, as has been demonstrated in ""Drosophila."" In addition, the authors provide further evidence for negative feedback regulation of ecdysteroids at the site of moult-​inhibiting hormone (MIH) production in the lobster eyestalk."
