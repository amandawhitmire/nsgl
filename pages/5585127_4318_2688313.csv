11,Abstract:,"The Western Pacific sponge ""Luffariella variabilis"" is the source of manoalide, which is a potent antiinflammator​y agent and irreversible inhibitor of phospholipase A2. In order to provide large quantities of manoalide for clinical evaluation, over 400 specimens of ""L. variabilis"" were collected from three locations in Palau; there was surprisingly considerable variation in their secondary metabolite content. Small and variable quantities of a dehydro derivative of manoalide, which has been incorrectly represented in the past, were observed. The structural elucidations of (4E,6E)-​dehydromanoalid​e and luffalactone, a tetracyclic sesterterpene acetate that eluted with dehydromanoalid​e during column chromatography, are presented."
