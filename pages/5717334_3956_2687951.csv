23,Abstract:,"The Caribbean sponge ""Batzella"" sp. contains a number of guanidine alkaloids, two of which, batzelladines A and B, inhibit binding of HIVgp-120 to CD4 and are therefore potential inhibitors of HIV. In addition to the known metabolites ptilomycalin A, ptilocaulin, carambescin A, crambescidin 800, and crambescidin 816, ""Batzella"" sp. contains five new alkaloids, batzelladines A-E, the structures of which were elucidated by interpretation of spectral data and chemical degradation."
