11,Abstract:,"Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation was characterized for the large subunit rRNA-coding gene (16SrDNA) in two closely related Pacific oyster species (""Crassostrea gigas"" and ""C. sikamea"") and an out group, the Olympia oyster (""Ostrea lurida""). Although each species was shown to have a single, fixed haplotype for the DNA sequence under study, 7 nucleotide differences were found between ""C. gigas"" and ""C. sikamea"", and these two species differed from the ""O. lurida"" haplotype at 62 and 60 nucleotide sites, respectively. DNA sequence-​specific discrimination techniques were developed and sequence-​specific PCR primers, dot-blot hybridization, and restriction digests were used as alternate techniques for rapid diagnosis of ""Crassostrea"" oyster larvae."
