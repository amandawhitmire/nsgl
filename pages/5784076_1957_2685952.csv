10,Abstract:,"Cultural practices toward animals are often misunderstood and judged by another group as harmful to the animal or the environment, causing outrage and misunderstandin​gs. Such conflict can intensify negative feelings of cultural groups toward each other. A survey of attitudes toward marine wildlife among residents of Southern California's urbanized coastal zone was undertaken for use in coastal zone management and museum development. This publication discusses the design of the survey instrument."
