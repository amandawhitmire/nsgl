16,Abstract:,"The IsoFishR application is a data reduction and analysis tool for laser-ablation strontiumisotop​e data, following common best practices and providing reliable and reproducibleres​ults. Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) are a powerful geochemical tracer commonlyapplied in a wide range of scientific fields and laser-ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometryis considered the method of choice to obtain spatially resolved 87Sr/86Sr isotoperatios from a variety of sample materials. However, data reduction and analyses methodsare variable between different research groups and research communities limiting reproducibility​between studies. IsoFishR provides a platform to standardize these methods and canbe used for both spot and time-resolved line transects. Furthermore, it provides advanceddata analysis tools and filters for outlier removal, noise reduction, and visualization of timeresolved data. The application can be downloaded from GitHub (https://github​.com/MalteWillm​es/IsoFishR) and the source code is available, encouraging future developmentand evolution of this software."
