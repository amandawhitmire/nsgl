11,Abstract:,"Orange sponges are conspicuous inhabitants of Fiji coral reefs. An abundant, round, orange Fijian sponge, ""Acanthella carvenosa"", yields crude extracts which are extremely active in an in-vitro anthelmintic primary screen against parasitic stages of ""Nippostrongylu​s brasiliensis"". Diterpenoid antibiotics, the kalihinols, have been isolated from Pacific collections of ""Acanthella"" sp. Structurally, the kalihinols fall into two main groups, the tetrahydropyran kalihinols, represented by kalihinol A, and the tetrahydrofuran kalihinols, represented by kalihinol F. Reported here is the structure of a new tetrahydrofuran​, isokalihinol F."
