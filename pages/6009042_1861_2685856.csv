14,Abstract:,"In this report the authors estimate amounts of coseismic subsidence at the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) based largely on plant macrofossil data. Paleosubsidence can be estimated to +/- 0.5 m on the basis of relative peat development and diagnostic fossil assemblages. Three regional data sets document the spatial and temporal variability of episodic coseismic subsidence at the Cascadia margin. The first data set includes two different types of paleosubmergenc​e records in coastal Oregon. In northern Oregon all coastal wetlands with peaty deposits extending to at least 1.5 m depth record episodic subsidence. Coastal localities in central and southern Oregon show either episodic subsidence or continuous submergence. The second data set comprises paleosubsidence estimates for the last great Cascadia earthquake (about 1700 AD) from Vancouver Island, Washington, Oregon and northernmost California. Coseismic subsidence ranges from a maximum of 2 +/- 0.5 m in southwest Washington, to generally 1 +/- 0.5 m in northern Oregon and western Vancouver Island, to 0 +/- 0.5 m in central Oregon."
