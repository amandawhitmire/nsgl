10,Abstract:,"Molting is necessary for the discontinuous size increases exhibited by crustaceans. Almost 25 years ago, ecdysteroids (Ecds) were first identified and characterized as the steroid molting hormones in insects and crustaceans. In this study, Ecd titers were measured during the molt cycle of ""Homarus americanus."" Individual animals showed small, transitory rises of Ecds which increased in magnitude with the onset of premolt and culminated in a large premolt peak at morphological stages D2(2)-Dc(1). Male lobsters had significant postmolt peaks and late premolt titers that remained high until ecdysis. In females, postmolt peaks were absent and late premolt titers reached basal levels before ecdysis. At least seven different Ecd metabolites were identified. The pattern of Ecd metabolites in the hemolymph supports other data indicative of 20E as the major molting hormone. Metabolism of 20E is primarily toward more polar compounds, including conjugates."
