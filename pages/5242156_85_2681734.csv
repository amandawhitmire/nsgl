12,Abstract:,"The data contained in this report were obtained as a continuance of the nearly bi-weekly hydrographic observations initiated by personnel at Hopkins Marine Station over two decades ago. These observations have been supported through the years by the State of California Marine Research Committee, California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations. Since July 1974, the hydrographic sampling program has been carried out by the investigators at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. From July 1974 to June 1976, this work was done in conjunction with an interdisciplina​ry study of the squid, Loligo opalescens, supported by the National Office of Sea Grant via the University of California Sea Grant College Project Number R/F-15. Five of the original CalCOFI stations (2201, 2202, 2203, 2204 and 2205) have been retained in our sampling routine and additional inner-bay stations have been added (1154 and 1121). Sampling was conducted monthly. All observations were made aboard R/V 0C0N0ST0TA."
