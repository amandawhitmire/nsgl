10,Abstract:,"Nemerteans of the genus ""Carcinonemerte​s"" are specialized symbionts of decapod crustaceans. Two species, ""Carcinonemerte​s epialti"" and ""Carcinonemerte​s errans"" have previously been described from the west coast of North America. Nemerteans from the red king crab were found to be quite different from those species in both morphology and life history. The egg predator ""Carcinonemerte​s regicides"" n.sp. is described from the broods of the red king crab, ""Paralithodes camtschatica"", from Alaska. In addition, the distinctive morphological characters of the species of ""Carcinonemerte​s"" are discussed, and aspects of the life history of the new species are presented."
