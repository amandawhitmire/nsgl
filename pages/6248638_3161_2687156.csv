9,Abstract:,"Teachers are integrating AIS into ""core"" curriculum and student led community stewardship projects. Major curriculum developers like UC Berkeley's FOSS are including some invasive species info; many do not. Some invasive species introductions have been linked to use and release of live specimens in schools. Recent actions indicate increased awareness by NSTA and the National Research Council."
