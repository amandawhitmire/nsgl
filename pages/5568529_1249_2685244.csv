10,Abstract:,"Interest in marine planktonic microbial processes has focused attention on the confused state of existing systematics for the 'naked' planktonic choreotrichs and the inaccurate taxonomic identification of these organisms accompanying ecological research. Recently, researchers took up the dual challenge of establishing criteria for taxonomic assessment based on Protargol silver-stained specimens and of reconciling these findings with historical descriptions. This paper provides a description of the planktonic ciliate protist ""Strombidinopsi​s cheshiri"" n. sp., from the nearshore environment of southern California."
