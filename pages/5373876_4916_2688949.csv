9,Abstract:,"The relationship between epibiotic bacteria and egg retention in lobsters has not been previously assessed. As preliminary observations on the egg coat and stalk of ""Homarus"" eggs from laboratory-​reared females revealed significant numbers of micro-​organisms, this study was undertaken to: (1) evaluate the types and numbers of bacteria on the egg coats of wild females, (2) compare observations on wild-type females with those spawned or reared in laboratories, (3) compare epibiotic growth on the eggs of females with different maintenance histories and of different species, (4) determine when after spawning epibiotic bacteria appear on egg surfaces, and (5) correlate bacterial load on eggs with dropping of eggs from the pleopods."
