8,Abstract:,"As the Arctic grows in importance as a strategic region and as a source for critical resources, the need for a new regime to establish rules of governance also grows. This article explores questions arising about the nature of such a regime. Until recent times, there has been confusion as to whether there is a regime of the Arctic or merely a collection of unilateral state acts. Under most definitions, arrangements which have been worked out are based on national claims, and negotiations have been primarily distributional or positional. Although most fundamental questions have not yet been answered, there are some hopeful indications that these issues are being addressed. This article examines some of these recent trends and attempts to assess the shape of the future regime of the Arctic. Included are discussion of the terms of reference (regimes, distributional and integrative bargaining, etc.); explication of the physical factors which make the Arctic case distinctive and why the Arctic has become an important region in world politics; examination of the current conflict problems and trends in policymaking; and some conclusions about `the age of the Arctic.'"
