12,Abstract:,"A novel molecular technique for identification of specific bacterial species within a complex mixture uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes from a mixture of bacteria. One of the PCR primers is labeled with a fluorescent dye to allow detection of the amplified product. Only restriction fragments that contain the fluorescent-​labeled primer are detected. Generally, the nucleotide sequence of the SSU rRNA genes is unique for each bacterial species. Thus, the different fluorescent peaks that appear in a capillary electropherogra​m correspond to labeled restriction fragments from different bacterial species. This protocol allows us to identify a number of different bacterial species in a complex mixture. Only a minute sample of bacterial DNA and a minimal amount of time (8-10 h) are required for this analysis. The protocol is sensitive, rapid and capable of identifying a broad spectrum of bacterial species."
