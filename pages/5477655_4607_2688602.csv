8,Abstract:,"An analysis of cargo flows through U.S. seaports reveals a concentration of growth at a few load-center ports. Previous efforts to explain the distribution of cargo movements between ports have utilized simple system models based on the minimization of system-wide costs. Differences in port prices or hinterland development, however, are rarely a sufficient explanation of the growth of load-center ports. Major seaports in the U.S. are organized and managed as public enterprises, with port managers pursuing one of three basic objectives-​-​profit, throughput, or social welfare maximization. The management strategy determines port service characteristics​. The demand for port services is usually determined by the opportunities perceived by profit-​maximizing ship operators to generate revenues in excess of costs by using the facilities at a specific port. A model is developed here to evaluate federal, state, and local policy alternatives in terms of the pricing strategy and the resulting levels of profit, throughput, social welfare, and national cost."
