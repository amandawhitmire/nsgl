9,Abstract:,"These abstracts of 22 poster and 23 oral presentations were compiled from the 2002 GEOHAB workshop and conference. The intent of GEOHAB is to inform scientists of new techniques and methodologies in the geological mapping of aquatic benthic habitats and to investigate ways of presenting geology in a manner that is useful to a general cross- section of scientific disciplines, especially biologists. New thematic maps and habitat characterizatio​n are the major topics."
