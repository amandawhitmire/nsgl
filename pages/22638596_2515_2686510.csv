17,Abstract:,"Coastal wetlands are among the most productive habitats on Earth and sequester globally significant amounts of atmospheric carbon (C). Extreme rates of soil C accumulation are widely assumed to reflect efficient C storage. Yet the fraction of wetland C lost via hydrologic export has not been directly quantified, since comprehensive budgets including direct estimates of lateral C loss are lacking. We present a complete net ecosystem C budget (NECB), demonstrating that lateral losses of C area major component of the NECB for the largest stable brackish tidal marsh on the U.S. Pacific coast.Mean annual net ecosystem exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere (NEE . −185 g C m2 year−1, negativeNEE denoting ecosystem uptake) was compared to long‐term soil C burial (87–110 g C m2 year−1),suggest​ing only 47–59% of fixed atmospheric C accumulates in soils. Consistently, direct monitoring in2017–2018 showed NEE of −255 g C m−2 year−1, and hydrologic export of 105 g C m−2 year−1 (59% ofNEE remaining on site). Despite their high C sequestration capacity, lateral losses from coastal wetlands are typically a larger fraction of the NECB when compared to other terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of inorganic C (the least measured NECB term) was 91% of hydrologic export and may be the most important term limiting C sequestration. The high productivity of coastal wetlands thus serves a dual function of C burial and estuarine export, and the multiple fates of fixed C must be considered when evaluating wetland capacity for C sequestration."
