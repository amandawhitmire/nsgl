10,Abstract:,"Researchers examined the spatial distribution of fishing activity for rockfish ""Sebastes"" spp. in the area surrounding the Big Creek Marine Ecological Reserve, located off central California. The goal was to determine whether fishing activity was concentrated along the edge of the reserve, and what factors determined the spatial distribution of fishing activity. No aggregation was found near the reserve."
