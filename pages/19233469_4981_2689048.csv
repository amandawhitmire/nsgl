13,Abstract:,"A journey down California’s 1,100-mile coastline reveals rocky seashores, sandy beaches, and dramatic cliffs that are home to diverse plants, seabirds, and a wide variety of marine life. Offshore islands provide a lens into the history of the California coast and provide protected habitats for both terrestrial and marine species. One can also see super highways, power plants, concrete river channels, trash, poor water quality, and two of the busiest ports in the United States. USC’s location in the middle of Los Angeles has made the Sea Grant Program here an important regional resource, concentrating on issues arising out of the necessity of managing people and natural resources in an intensely populated and developed coastline. For this reason, in the 1980s, the USC Sea Grant program adopted as its programmatic focus the “Urban Ocean,” a theme that continues to characterize our perspective on the needs of this region. USC Sea Grant’s strategic plan goals for 2018-​2021 reflect America’s most urgent coastal and ocean needs, NOAA’s national priorities, and the National Sea Grant Program’s goals, while still addressing the specific needs and priorities of the region and the state. Under the larger umbrella of the urban ocean theme, our program’s focus areas are congruent with the National Sea Grant College Program Strategic Plan for 2018-2021 (henceforth referred to as the National Plan) and include: Healthy Coastal Ecosystems; Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture; Resilient Communities and Economies; and Environmental Literacy and Workforce Development."
