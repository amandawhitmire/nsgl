14,Abstract:,"The aim of this study was to characterise the physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved in seawater (SW) acclimation in the striped bass, and to determine how this species tolerates abrupt transfer from freshwater (FW) to full-strength SW. The time course of SW acclimation was studied, and FW- and SW- acclimated fish were compared with respect to several parameters in gill, opercular membrane, intestine and kidney. As salinity induced only minor changes in the osmoregulatory organs examined, it is proposed that the intrinsic euryhalinity of the striped bass may be related to a high degree of 'preparedness' for hypoosmoregulatâ€‹ion that is uncommon among teleosts studied to date."
