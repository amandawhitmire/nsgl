10,Abstract:,"Ester hydrolysis of methyl farnesoate (MF) by crustacean tissue homogenates was measured using radiochemical partition assay. Tissues were obtained from several species of lobster, shrimp, and crab. The greatest specific activities were recovered from the hepatopancreas. The rate of MF hydrolysis by esterases extracted from the juvenile lobster hepatopancreas could not be correlated with molt stage or sex and was significantly influenced by eyestalk ablation, mandibular organ ablation, or MF injection. Other results are discussed."
