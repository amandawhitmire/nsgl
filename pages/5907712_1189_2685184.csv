12,Abstract:,"California and Maine have similar problems related to sea level rise (SLR). This paper examines several factors that local governments in these two states can take into account when planning for SLR. Those factors include: special interest areas such as wetlands and sand dunes, protective measures and beach renourishment, mitigation of hazards, stakeholder involvement in policy formulation and implementation, and economic incentives or disincentives for building in hazardous areas, including the availability of insurance."
