13,Abstract:,"The Sea Grant Extension Program (SGEP) is the University of California's statewide education link with the commercial fishing industry. Two major ongoing long-term problems of the fishing industry are been chronically low income levels and full- or overexploitatio​n of fish stocks. These problems were especially severe (luring the first half of the 1980s. With most fish resources fully utilized, one of the only means of improving the situation is improved economic efficiency, especially through fuel conservation. Fuel costs represent a large portion of most fishermen's variable costs. The project goals were to evaluate the energy-​saving potential of new fishing technology (including trawl doors, self-polishing paints, propeller optimization) and to encourage adoption of fuel-saving technologies and behaviors by fishing vessel owner-​operators. This was accomplished through: (1) three at-sea demonstrations, (2) 13 educational workshops, (3) publications, and (4) loan program development. The project evaluation objectives were to: 1. Measure fuel savings of three new technologies compared to current practices. 2. Estimate fuel savings due to adoption of technologies financed through the loan program. The first 18 months of this project have led to successful implementation of a California fishing industry energy conservation program. Fuel-saving technologies have been evaluated and industry is utilizing the loan program to upgrade its fuel efficiency."
