9,Abstract:,"""Ceratomyxa shasta"" is difficult to detect because the life cycle of the parasite includes two alternate hosts: salmonids and the freshwater polychaete worm, ""Manayunkia speciosa"" (Bartholomew et al. 1997). Salmonids are the only known fish hosts for ""C. shasta"". Although susceptibility may vary between species and strain, all salmonids should be considered susceptible. The parasite is enzootic in a number of waters in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Alaska, and B.C., Canada (Bartholomew et al. 1989a), but has not been reported outside of that region. Diagnosis is complicated by the long period required for development of mature myxospores in the fish and by the pleomorphic appearance of the presporogonic stages. Parasite development is temperature dependent, but in general, at 12 degrees C, a minimum of 40 days is required for spore development in rainbow trout in the laboratory. Confirmation of ""C. shasta"" is based on identification of myxospores with the appropriate morphology or by PCR confirmation of presumptive presporogonic life stages."
