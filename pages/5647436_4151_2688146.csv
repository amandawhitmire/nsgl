11,Abstract:,"Three species of cupped oysters have been introduced from Japan to the west coast of North America for cultivation, the Pacific oyster ""Crassostrea gigas"", the Kumamoto oyster ""C. sikamea"", and the Suminoe oyster ""C. ariakensia"". Recent attempts to find ""C. sikamea"" in Ariake Bay, Japan, have yielded only specimens with the allozyme or mtDNA profiles of ""C. gigas"". Of great concern, therefore, is the status of Kumamoto stocks in North America, which may be threatened by hybridization with Pacific oysters and by very small effective sizes of commercial brood stock populations. Reported here are the results of a genetic survey of two major independent lineages of Kumamoto oysters in the U.S. commercial oyster culture industry. Steps should be taken both to eradicate Pacific oysters and interspecific hybrids from North American Kumamoto brood stocks and to retard the erosion of genetic diversity within these brood stocks."
