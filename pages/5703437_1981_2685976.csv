9,Abstract:,"Bacteria interact with metals in various ways and thereby are important agents in the geochemical cycling of metals. Metal-microbe interactions are currently exploited in a number of different technologies including leaching, extraction, beneficiation, adsorption and ion exchange. The focus of this review is on the potential biotechnologica​l applications of metal precipitation by marine bacteria. The metabolic diversity of marine bacteria is largely unexplored. In the marine environment there are regions of extreme physical conditions, such as those found in the deep sea and at deep sea hydrothermal vents, that do not occur elsewhere on earth, and in which novel metal-microbe interactions may exist. Thus, marine bacteria represent a new frontier for exploration of potential processes and biomolecules for biotechnology."
