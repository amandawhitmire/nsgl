9,Abstract:,"Although the smoltification-​associated change in hypoosmoregulat​ory ability of salmon has been well studied, little is known about the endocrinology involved. Other studies have suggested that growth hormone and possibly cortisol are involved in salmonid hypoosmoregulat​ory processes. The present study examines the effects of these hormones on gill chloride cell density, gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity, and hypoosmoregulat​ory ability in presmoltified and in desmoltified coho salmon. The experiments were conducted to determine if either hormone would produce changes in these features similar to those observed during smoltification."
