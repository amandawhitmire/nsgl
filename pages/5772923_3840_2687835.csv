11,Abstract:,"Using a simple growth model, the authors show that positive correlations between size at maturity and asymptotic size are predicted for different individuals in the same species if growth costs of reproduction are inversely related to size at maturity. The authors confirm several key elements of the growth model using data from female ""Iguana iguana"" lizards, includng the novel assumption that instantaneous growth rates of adults of the same length will be positively related to their length at maturity. These analyses suggest a simple and possible general explanation for positive correlations between size at maturity and asymptotic size within--and perhaps also among--species that continue to grow after maturity."
