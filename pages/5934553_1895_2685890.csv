11,Abstract:,"Archaea are traditionally thought of as 'extremophiles,​' but recent studies have shown that marine planktonic Archaea make up a surprisingly large percentage of ocean midwater microbial communities. However, the basic physiology and contribution of Archaea to community microbial activity remain unknown. The authors have studied Archaea from 200-m depths of the northwest Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific Ocean near California, measuring the archaeal activity under simulated natural conditions by means of a method called substrate tracking autoradiography fluorescence in situ hybridization (STARFISH). Results showed that the Archaea are active in the uptake of dissolved amino acids from natural concentrations. Bacteria showed a similar proportion of active cells, concluded that a portion of these archaea is heterotrophic and appears to coexist successfully with bacteria in the same water."
