11,Abstract:,"The relationship between spatial variation in giant kelp (""Macrocystis pyrifera"") and the density of local populations of rocky inshore fish species in the Southern California Bight is explored. Variation in giant kelp may have profound consequences because giant kelp is the major algal structure on rocky reefs in the bight, providing substrate-â€‹oriented fish with a spatial refuge, food derived from enhanced secondary productivity, and nursery and foraging habitat. Quantitative relationships between the abundance of giant kelp and fish density are used to establish the degree to which species of fish that share particular reproductive modes and resource requirements show similar associations with giant kelp. The results strongly suggest that the effect of giant kelp on reef fishes is predictable and dependent on the ontogenetic resource requirements of each species."
