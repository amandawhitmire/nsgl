10,Abstract:,"To date no considerations have been established to include human and organizational errors as an integral part of the design, construction, and operation of tankers and offshore structures. This report examines the development of human and organizational error models for two case study examples to identify and correlate the impacts of human factors on marine casualties. In addition, the model develpments assist engineers, operators, and regulators in determining HOE management alternatives in developing future operating policy and procedures."
