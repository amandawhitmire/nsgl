12,Abstract:,"Confusion in the taxonomy of economically important tropical and subtropical algae remains the single greatest obstacle to progress in Pacific seaweed aquaculture and marine natural products chemistry. In this richly illustrated volume,the fifth in a series, an international group of specialists representing the United States, Japan, China, Chile, Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Fiji describe the results of a workshop on the taxonomy of the groups ""Sargassum"", ""Gelidium"", ""Gracilaria"", and ""Eucheuma"". The workshop, sponsored by the California Sea Grant College System in cooperation with the Pacific Sea Grant College Programs of Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington, was held at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu, in 1993."
