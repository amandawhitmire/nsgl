9,Abstract:,"An approach for estimation of molting probabilities may exist for species that exhibit a well-defined molting season. A realistic approach to reconstruction of the preseason size frequency distribution and estimation of size-specific molting probabilities is based on classification of a sample collected after a molting season into molted and nonmolted groups. Classification relies, in general, on an unspecified postmolt indicator. Models and assumptions are explicitly formulated which allow for the derivation of sampling variance formulas for calculated estimates of molting probabilities. Methods should be applicable to other crustaceans that exhibit a well-defined molting season and for which a reliable postmolt indicator exists."
