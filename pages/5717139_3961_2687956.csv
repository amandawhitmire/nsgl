14,Abstract:,"""Dictyota"" species of the Indian Ocean continue to be good sources of novel structural types of diterpenes. The alga ""Dictyota bartayresiana"" Lamaroux (Phaeophyceae) remained a target of chemical analysis for secondary metabolites. A specimen collected from Hare Island in the Gulf of Mannar yielded five known and three new dolabellanes, and one known and two new dolastanes."
