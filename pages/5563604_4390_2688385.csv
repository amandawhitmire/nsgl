10,Abstract:,"Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins can be concentrated in the tissues of bivalve molluscs following ingestion of toxigenic algae and cause PSP in man and severe economic losses to the seafood industry. Adductor muscles, usually considered safe, are the main tissues marketed from most scallops but some species are eaten whole. Over the last decade there has been a growing interest in culturing rock scallops on the west coast of North America because the existing population is too sparse to support a commercial fishery. However, unsafe levels of PSP toxins in adductor muscles of ""C. gigantea"" collected from British Columbia, Washington and California indicate that this species is a potential health hazard and should be continually monitored by the mouse bioassay. Consumption of viscera or whole bodies of rock scallops increases an individual's risk of contracting PSP. Prospective culturists should be aware that toxic algal blooms may periodically halt the marketing of ""C. gigantea"" or its adductor muscles."
