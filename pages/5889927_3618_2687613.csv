11,Abstract:,"The California abalone aquaculture industry has been struggling to rid itself of an exotic sabellid, ""Terebrasabella heterouncinata,​"" following its introduction in the late l980's. This study examines the fertilization strategies and the life history of ""T. heterouncinata""​. Researchers investigated whether an isolated sabellid is capable of reproduction through two generations and further assessed the reproductive capabilities of ""T. heterouncinata"" by quantifying generation times at three water temperatures."
