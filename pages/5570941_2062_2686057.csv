11,Abstract:,"It is now well established that the genetic diversity and uniqueness of marine organisms make them a prime resource for new pharmaceuticals and other natural products. One of the stated purposes of this workshop was to bring together leading scientists to discuss new research avenues that may open as a result of recent advances in molecular biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and biotechnology and that might impact marine pharmacology and natural product chemistry over the next decade. Participants representing universities and industries from across the nation met to discuss new research avenues that may open over the next decade as a result of recent advances in molecular biolgy, chemistry, biochemistry, and biotechnology and that might impact marine pharmacology and natural products chemistry. Major areas of discussion included new chemistry and drug synthesis; drug receptors, screening, and discovery; new marine resources in natural product chemistry; new biochemical and molecular models; and drug receptors and cellular processes."
