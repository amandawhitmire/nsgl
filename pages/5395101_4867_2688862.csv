The mild year-round climate of the Bay Area encourages a variety of outdoor recreational activities. Two of the most visible and popular of these activities are sports fishing and sailing. Both are directly tied to Bay Area weather. This brochure describes the general climate of the Bay Area and offers specific information related to fishing, sailing and other waterfront pursuits."
