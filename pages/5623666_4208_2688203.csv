10,Abstract:,"In order to elucidate possible detoxication mechanisms, the disposition and biotransformati​on of pentachlorophen​ol (PCP, a general biocide) were compared in two marine molluscs: a bivalve, the Pacific oyster (""Crassostrea gigas""), and a gastropod, the green abalone (""Haliotis fulgens""). Because of the widespread use of PCP, both species may be impacted; however, due to their different morphologies, their response to acute PCP exposure may vary. Experiments showed that during short-term exposure, Pacific oysters limit the accumulation of PCP, possibly by closing their shells, and efficiently depurate retained residues to limit toxic effects. In contrast, green abalones rely more on biotransformati​on to detoxify residues since they can neither limit PCP accumulation nor depurate retained residues as effectively."
