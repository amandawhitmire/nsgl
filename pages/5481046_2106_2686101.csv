10,Abstract:,"In this paper the reliability of parallel structural systems is studied in order to begin to understand and quantify the system factors influencing the overload capacity and the redundancy of realistic statically indeterminate structures. Redundancy is defined as the conditional probability of system failure given first failure of any member (it is an inverse measure). The present study considers unbalanced parallel systems. In an unbalanced system, the ratio of mean member force to mean capacity is different for different members in the intact and in the damaged states of the structure; system effects inducing redundancy are both deterministic and probabilistic in origin. The effects of various parameters, like number of members, post-failure member capacity, excess design capacity, etc., are investigated. Simple approximation is developed for estimation of the probability of failure of complex unbalanced systems."
