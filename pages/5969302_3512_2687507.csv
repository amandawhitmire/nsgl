10,Abstract:,"Near UV visual pigments have been reported in single cones of several freshwater and euryhaline fishes. The presence of UV visual pigments in stenohaline marine fishes have, as yet, not been identified. In the pomacentridae near-UV visual pigments are present in single cones from the three species we examined--the tropical coral fishes ""Dascyllus trimaculatus"" and ""Pomacentrus coelestis"", and the temperate ""Chromis puntiinnis"". Maximum absorption of the UV pigments is centered around 260 mm. In juvenile ""Chromis"", however, the UV visual pigment is not present. Instead there is a single cone containing a violet- sensitive pigment absorbing maximally around 420mm. All three species are obligate diurnal planktivores. The UV sensitivity may function to enhance their ability to forage on zooplankton."
