8,Abstract:,"Volunteer anadromous fish enhancement programs are growing throughout the west from British Columbia to California. The enthusiasm and hard work of thousands of volunteers to restore salmon, steelhead and trout resources are paying off with increased returns to many damaged watersheds. As enhancement projects expand and improve, the need for technical information and assistance is vital. This handbook lists agency personnel who can be contacted by volunteers needing specific information. A topical coding has been used to list each individual's area of enhancement expertise."
