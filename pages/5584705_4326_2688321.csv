11,Abstract:,This paper aims at studying the mechanical stability of the pipe- soil system under wave action. The focus is on the conditions that lead to pipeline detachment or breakout from the seafloor under hydrodynamic wave loading. The breakout process is simulated in the laboratory and the critical wave-soil-pipe conditions for pipeline breakout are identified. Experiments are conducted for the configuration of a partially buried pipe in a sandy bed under shallow water wave forcing; partial burial is a common configuration of submarine pipelines on the seafloor.
