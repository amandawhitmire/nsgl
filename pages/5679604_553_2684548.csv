10,Abstract:,"Sea urchins are members of a large group of marine invertebrates that also includes starfish, sea cucumbers, sea lilies, and brittle stars. All sea urchins have a hard calcareous shell called a test, which is covered with a thin epithelium and is usually armed with spines. The spines are used for locomotion, protection, and for trapping drifting algae for food. Between the spines are tube feet that are used in food capture, locomotion, and for holding on to the substrate. Three species are harvested commercially on the U.S. West Coast; one of these is also harvested on the Atlantic Coast. This brochure describes each species, and tells something of where they're harvested. Processing techniques and seafood products are described."
