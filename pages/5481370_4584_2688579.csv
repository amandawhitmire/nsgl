8,Abstract:,"An unresolved philosophical controversy between the two camps of the environmental movement--the conservationist​s and the protectionists-​-​causes much of the conflict found in marine wildlife policy today. This paper reviews this philosophical dispute as it existed during the passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, and as it exists today in the implementation of that law, especially in relation with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (1976) provisions. Three case studies are presented: (1) the possible `depleted' status designation for the northern fur seal, (2) the lack of lethal management options for curbing sea lions at the Ballard Locks fish ladder in Washington State, and (3) the problems associated with managing marine mammal and fisheries resource competition. The paper concludes by comparing marine mammal protection with the animal rights/anti-​hunting movement onshore, and establishes an hypothetical scenario where protectionism continues to supercede the activities of fishermen."
