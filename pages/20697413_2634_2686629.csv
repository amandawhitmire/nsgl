14,Abstract:,"On November 13-14, 2017, the Aquarium of the Pacific and the Honda Marine Science Foundation convened and facilitated a forum on “Sato-umi in the Anthropocene.” ​The Forum was designed to explore a number of approaches to “integrated” coastal management, in particular those that cross the land-sea boundary, some of which have been practiced for thousands of years, to see if lessons could be extracted to elevate awareness and stimulate action to reduce vulnerability in the “new normal” of rising sea level. Sato-umi is one of these approaches. Th​is report presents brief case studies of coastal systems where Sato-umi, Ahupua’a and Integrated Coastal Management have been applied successfully and search for the conditions and strategies that were essential to their success. We also identify examples of coastal systems ripe for application of the whole watershed manag​ement embodied by these three principles, as well as examples where these principles could have been implemented, but were not, resulting in environmental damage to coastal resources. We present a variety of tools developed by NOAA and others for use in Integrated Coastal Management, explore what has limited their applicati​on, and offer recommendations​."
