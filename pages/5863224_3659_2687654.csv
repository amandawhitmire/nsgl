12,Abstract:,"Here researchers report the comprehensive biochemical analysis of hemolymph form the blue shrimp, ""Penaeus stylirostrus."" They evaluate the synthetic capabilities of the cells, rather than their viability or oxidative capacity, since the synthetic functions are critical to cell proliferation. The media were tested for their ability to support DNA and protein synthesis in primary cultured cells derived from the shrimp ovary."
