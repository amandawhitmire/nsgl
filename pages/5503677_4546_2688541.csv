13,Abstract:,"Manoalide is a potent antiinflammator​y marine natural product and a direct inactivator of venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2). The important role of PLA2 in the release of arachidonic acid, which is the biosynthetic precursor of proinflammatory eicosa noids, suggests that understanding the structure-​activity relationships of inactivation of PLA2 by manoalide will ultimately lead to a better understanding of PLA2 function in the whole cell and possibly the mechanism of hydrolysis of phospholipid substrates. The present structure-​activity study was designed, using marine natural product analogs of manoalide or chemical derivatives of manoalide, to further characterize the structural features of the manoalide molecule that are necessary fo r both potency and efficacy (irreversibilit​y) of this novel phospholipase inhibitor."
