10,Abstract:,"The outer surfaces of the shells of living marine gastropods are often colonized by other organisms. However, only one species, the sabellid worm ""Terebrasabella heterouncinata,​"" is able to settle in the aperture of living gastropods. Native to South Africa, and introduced to California, this worm is a pest of abalone aquaculture and has been a threat to native gastropods in California. The authors investigated the intrinsic susceptibility of 15 marine gastropods from California to this apertural fouling organism. Intrinsic susceptibility was significantly different among gastropod species. Overall, caenogastropods tended to be more resistant than were the vetigastropods and patellogastropo​ds. This suggests that variability in susceptibility could be due to characteristics associated with closely related gastropod hosts. However, this only partially explained the variation in susceptibility to individuals of ""T. heterouncinata.​"" Intrinsic susceptibility was not associated with potential host species from similar habitats. The authors discuss host susceptibility to ""T. heterouncinata,​"" including implications for potential control of this pest pecies, and for understanding factors enabling this polychaete to inhabit the apertural region, an area typically free of all other epibionts."
