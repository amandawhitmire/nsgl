11,Abstract:,"Sea Grant Extension Programs provide scientific information to promote solutions to coastal, ocean and lake management issues concerning the United States' coasts of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain. A university-â€‹affiliated network, the programs have achieved success through maintaining a neutral and nonadvocate approach to integrating science into coastal management decisions. Through their research and education outreach components they address water quality, watershed, invasive species, smart growth and other coastal management issues with personnel trained in ecological, economic, resource management and policy sciences. The presenters will provide brief examples from the extension programs of Hawaii, California, Michigan and Virginia. Following these, the audience will be engaged in a structured discussion to explore ways of: fostering information exchange; developing regional and national teams to strengthen coastal management research; and facilitating dissemination of research results to policy makers and stakeholders."
