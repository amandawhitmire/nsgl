8,Abstract:,"This paper discusses developing techniques for tissue, cell, and protoplast culture to be used in the conversion of wild seaweeds into cultivated crop plants with desirable properties. Seaweeds have complex life histories and do not have the equivalent of `seeds' capable of extended survival in storage. The authors, efforts concentrate on three major aspects: (1) development of techniques for vegetative propagation from isolated cells and protoplasts, (2) development of procedures for maintenance of tissues as seed stock, and (3) production of improved strains by selection of mutants and hybridization through protoplast fusion. The state of advances in vegetative propagation of representatives of the three groups of seaweeds from isolated cells is reported, along with efforts in selection for disease-â€‹resistant strains of ""Porphyra yesoensis"" (nori), a marine crop plant."
