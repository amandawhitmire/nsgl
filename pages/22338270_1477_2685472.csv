19,Abstract:,"We compared the efficacy of stable carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen isotope ratios in identifying the resources used by insect consumers in headwater streams of southern California. We also compared gut contents with consumer stable isotope ratios and mixing model estimates of resource contributions to predator diet. Stable hydrogen isotope ratios (as delta2H) of algivores were well separated from ratios for detritivores, whereas relationships between stable carbon (as delta13C) and nitrogen (as delta15N) ratios of consumers and their expected diets were weaker and more ambiguous. delta2H values of primary consumers more strongly reflected the proportions of their gut contents consisting of algae than delta13C values. The proportions of algivorous prey in predator gut contents increased with mixing model estimates of algivore contributions to predator diet using delta2H but not delta13C values. Our findings support the use of hydrogen isotope ratios in food web studies of streams in southern California and their potential use in assessing the effects of anthropogenic and natural disturbance on basal resource contributions to food webs that might not otherwise be identified using carbon isotope ratios."
