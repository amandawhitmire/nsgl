11,Abstract:,"This study employed a simulation model to compute the incidences of highly credible gastrointestinaâ€‹l illness (HCGI) in recreational bathers at two intermittently contaminated beaches of Orange County, California. Assumptions regarding spatial and temporal bathing patterns were used to determine exposure levels over a 31-month study period. Illness rates were calculated by applying previously reported relationships between enterococcus density and HCGI risk to the exposure data. Peak enterococcus concentrations occurred in late winter and early spring, but model results showed that most HCGI cases occurred during summer, attributable to elevated number of exposures. Tolerable risk thresholds were exceeded for 27 total days and periods of at least 6 consecutive days."
