13,Abstract:,"Harmful algal blooms are a ubiquitous phenomenon that has adverse effects on the well-being of aquatic organisms as well as humans and local economies. Although many physical and biological factors influence bloom dynamics, the role of bacterioplankto​n in contributing to the development and sustenance of blooms has not been adequately investigated. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that some bacterial associates of harmful algal (HA) species are important to the physiological welfare of algal cells. For example, some HA species such as the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum cannot be grown axenically indicating an obligatory requirement(s) that is supplied by the bacteria. One attractive hypothesis concerning the nature of this inter-species interaction that we are pursuing is that phytoplankton can 'hijack' iron, an element often limiting to their growth and has been shown to impact bloom formation, from extracellular siderophores produced by their bacterial associates. Although some diatoms have been shown to utilize bacterial siderophores, dinoflagellates​' iron acquisition mechanisms are for the most part unknown. Here we report the isolation of the dicitrate siderophore vibrioferrin (VF) from a small clade of Marinobacter species solely capable of supporting the growth of G. catenatum strains isolated from geographically diverse locations. In addition, the Fe-VF complex exhibited unparalleled photosensitivit​y causing the reduction of the bound iron and leading us to characterize its photoproduct (VF*). Surprisingly, VF* demonstrated no apparent affinity for iron indicating that the generated Fe(II) will be available for uptake by the toxic algae. This conserved association between the bacteria and the phytoplankton coupled with the unusual properties of VF indicates that vibrioferrin's production may be playing an indispensable role in this inter-species interaction and ultimately in bloom dynamics."
