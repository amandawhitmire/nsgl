8,Abstract:,"To define more clearly the influence of hormones on lipid metabolism in fish, an in-vitro assay system that continuously measures fatty acid (FA) release was adopted. The present study is concerned with direct in-vitro measurement of FA release from coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") liver and with assessing the hormone sensitivity of tissue triacylglycerol (TG) lipase. Three specific questions were asked. (1) What are the direct effects of catecholamine administration on FA release? (2) What receptors mediate potential lipolytic effects? (3) Does norepinephrine (NE) administration effect TG lipase activity? Results establish the presence of hormone-​sensitive lipase in salmon liver and suggest that NE-stimulated lipid mobilization in salmon liver is mediated throught beta-adrenergic pathways."
