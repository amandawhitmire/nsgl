10,Abstract:,"Among many invertebrate sperm and the sperm of a few vertebrates, the acrosome reaction (AR) consists of the exocytosis of an acrosomal vesicle and the generation of an acrosomal filament. This paper describes in detail the formation and morphology of the acrosomal filament of ""Sicyonia ingentis"" sperm."
