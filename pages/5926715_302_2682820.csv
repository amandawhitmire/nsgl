11,Abstract:,"This annual report represents achievements from research and outreach activities undertaken by California Sea Grant from March 2000 through February 2002. The purpose of the report is to highlight results that will inform the public, and provide a record of our accomplishments for individuals in government, industry and the academic community. California Sea Grant is the largest of 30 national programs located in our Great Lakes and coastal states. This 2000â€“2002 report provides the reader with a glimpse into some of the issues addressed by California Sea Grant. Topics such as preserving essential habitat to support fish populations, combating unwanted invading organisms, tracking coastal water quality and sediments, and seeking novel marine compounds remain a hallmark of the program. I encourage you to learn more about California Sea Grant and our achievements through this report. I trust you will be intrigued by these findings, and that you will endeavor to join with California Sea Grant in becoming better and more enlightened stewards of our precious marine resources."
