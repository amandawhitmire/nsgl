14,Abstract:,"Chitosan was precipitated onto wood pulp, glass and polypropylene fibers suitable for papermaking. The coating which formed on the fibers was characterized by photomicrographâ€‹y after the formation of colored derivatives, and by scanning electron microscopy. The most uniform and adherent coatings were formed on the wood pulp fibers and the least were formed on the polypropylene fibers. Paper handsheets were readily formed from the chitosan-coated wood pulp and glass fibers, but not from the chitosan-coated polypropylene fibers."
