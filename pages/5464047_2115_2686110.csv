9,Abstract:,"The bat ray has been the target of an annual sport fishery since at least 1950, and occasionally appears as a commercially fished species. To adequately assess the impact of continued or increased exploitation of the bat ray, it is necessary to know growth rates and age-specific fecundities. Cartilaginous fishes, including the bat ray, cannot be aged using traditional fish ageing methods, since they lack the necessary calcified structures. The objectives of this study were to test and use two techniques for age determination of bat rays to produce reasonable growth curves."
