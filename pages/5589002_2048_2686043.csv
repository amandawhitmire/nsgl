12,Abstract:,"Pseudopterolide is a marine natural product isolated from the soft coral ""Pseudopterogor​gia acerosa"". Early studies on its biological activity revealed that the compound had anti- inflammatory activity; it also inhibited cell proliferation in sea urchin embryos and in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. This study investigated the action of pseudopterolide on mitosis and cytokinesis in fertilized ""Strongylocentr​otus purpuratus"" embryos. The results indicate that low concentrations of pseudopterolide (approximately 10 micrometers and below) inhibit cytokinesis selectively, whereas mitosis and nuclear division are unimpaired. The selective action of pseudopterolide may be caused by an interaction of the compound with a highly sensitive sulfhydryl-​containing cell component that is critical to contractile ring formation and cytokinesis."
