8,Abstract:,"We feel the presence of phytoplankton every day in various ways. For instance, take two deep breaths: one to thank the trees and one to thank the phytoplankton. These microscopic, photosynthetic ​ organisms produce roughly 50% of the oxygen we breathe and are therefore extremely important in sustaining life on this planet. However, we also occasionally feel the impacts of phytoplankton in negative ways when they appear as harmful algal blooms (HABs). Certain oceanic conditions can trigger rapid growth of phytoplankton, ​ increasing their abundances greatly and often coloring coastal waters a red or brown hue. When the algae causing these “red” or “brown” tides also produce toxins, they turn into HABs and can become problematic. This is a blog post written by USC Sea Grant student and Sea Grant Trainee on recent research results on HABs."
