11,Abstract:,"Polymerized tubulin dimers exist in equilibrium with the free tubulin dimers. Compounds such as colchicine, vincristine, etc., bind free tubulin dimers and shift the equilibrium in favor of depolymerized tubulin to inhibit microtubule formation. Disruption of microtubule function can interrupt many cellular processes. Disruption of mitotic spindles (composed of tubulin) appears to be particularly important for anticancer activity with treated cells accumulating in the M phase. This assay is based on morphological changes of rat glioma cells treated with db- cAMP. The db-cAMP treatment induces a tubulin-​dependent change causing the cells to acquire a spherical shape. Pretreatment with tubulin inhibitors brings about the disintegration of tubulin polymer and/or prevents its polymerization. Cells with inhibited tubulin fail to respond to db-cAMP treatment."
