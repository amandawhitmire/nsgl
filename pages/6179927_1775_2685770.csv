13,Abstract:,"Conferences are excellent venues for exchanging the newest information and networking with peers. Coordinating the International Smoked Seafood Conference in Alaska in March, 2007 was a great deal of effort on the part of many people and a great deal of money from many organizations. The meeting included academics, the seafood industry and regulatory agencies and was quite successful. This presentation will include helpful information for those who would attempt to stage a conference including how decisions were made, the sequence of events, and lessons learned from the smoked seafood conference. A summary of the information presented at the conference will be included."
