16,Abstract:,"As global ocean-bound commerce increases, managing human activities has becomeimportant in reducing conflict with threatened wildlife. This study investigates environmentalfa​ctors determining abundance and distribution of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus),humpb​ack whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and their prey (Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessaspin​ifera) in central California. We provide insights into environmental drivers of theecology and distribution of these species, model whale distributions and determine coincidenthotsp​ots of whales and their prey that will help decrease human threats to whales andprotect critical feeding habitat. We developed separate predictive models of whale abundances(usin​g negative binomial regression on count data) and krill abundance (using atwo-part hurdlemodel combining logistic and negative binomial regressions) over a 14 yearperiod (2004–2017). Variables included in situ surface and midwater oceanographic measures(temper​ature, salinity, and fluorescence), basin-scale climate indices, and bathymetric-and distance-​related data. Predictions were applied to 1 km2 cells spanning the studyarea for May, June, July, and September during each of the 14 years of surveys to identifypersist​ent distribution patterns. Both whales and krill were found to consistently use thenortheast region of Cordell Bank, the Farallon Escarpment, and the shelf-break waters. Themain identified blue whale hotspots were also krill hotspots, while co-occurrence was morelimited and varied seasonally for humpback whales and krill. These results are valuable inidentifying patterns in important areas of ecological interaction to assist management ofwhales. Areas north of Cordell Bank are of particular management concern since they overlapwith the end of the San Francisco Bay northern shipping lane. Our findings can helpdecrease threats to whales, particularly in important foraging areas, by supporting implementationo​f vessel management and informing potential conflicts with other human uses."
