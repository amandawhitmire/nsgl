10,Abstract:,"The jellied muscle condition in Dover sole is one in which the flesh is slimy, jelly-like, quivering to the touch, glossy, and opalescent. The jellied condition can extend throughout the entire fillet in the extreme case, although the flesh close to the dorsal and anal fins typically shows the highest degree of jellification. Jellied flesh is characterized by normal odor, high moisture content and drip loss, low protein, high sodium and low potassium; gross appearance is adversely affected. Jellied fillets require more cooking time, exhibit greater shrinkage during cooking and produce an inferior if not unacceptable cooked product. The objective of the research reported herein is to characterize the jellied muscle histologically and ultrastructuralâ€‹ly."
