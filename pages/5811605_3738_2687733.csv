15,Abstract:,"To improve the accuracy and precision of radiometric age determination using 210Pb 226Ra disequilibria in otoliths of fishes, a technique was developed incorporating an ion- exchange procedure followed by isotope-​dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) to determine 226Ra. The focus of this paper is the determination of 226Ra activity in otoliths using the new technique and a comparison with the traditional techniques, where the benefits of TIMS are discussed."
