14,Abstract:,"The northern anchovy ""Engraulis mordax"" is considered to comprise a northern subpopulation spawning primarily in summer in the Columbia River plume, a central subpopulation spawning primarily in winter and spring in the Southern California Bight, and a southern subpopulation spawning off Punta Eugenia and in Magdalena Bay, Baja, California. Previously, significant heterogeneity of allelic frequencies was reported among samples collected from within the range of the central subpopulation. This paper presents comparable allozyme data for anchovies collected in four subsequent cruises."
