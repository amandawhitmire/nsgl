10,Abstract:,"The concentration of age pigments (lipofuscin) in fish tissues may be a measure of fish age that could be used to validate other ageing techniques and might also improve estimates of age of long-lived species where other techniques are difficult to apply. A preliminary study was designed to assess the usefulness of extracted lipofuscin as a method of ageing fishes. Two species of cold-water fishes are included: the rainbow trout, ""Salmo gairdneri"", reared in captivity and of known age; and the dover sole, ""Microstomus pacificus"", a long-lived fish in which age is not known with certainty. Spectral characteristics of the extracted lipofuscin from several tissues and the change in concentration of lipofuscin with fish age are described."
