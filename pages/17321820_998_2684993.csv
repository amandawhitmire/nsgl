21,Abstract:,"This guide identifies key environmental conditions that affect Olympia oysters. A qualitative evaluation of 28 embayments along much of the range of the species identifies the areas at risk due to low population sizes or unreliable recruitment, and characterizes patterns of exposure to stressors. The most frequently encountered stressors were sedimentation and predation. Competittion, cold water temperatures, warm air temperatures, and freshwater inputs were also common concerns at many bays. Quantitative site evaluations incorporating oyster attributes and environmental conditions were conducted at six estuaries in California and Oregon to prioritize sites for conservation value and restoration potential. Development of an online site evaluation tool allows end-users to conduct similar evaluations in new regions, thereby guiding future restoration and mangement efforts. The purpose of this guide is to inform restoration and conservation of Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida). It was prepared by an interdisciplina​ry team funded by NOAA's National Estuarine Research Reserve Science Collaborative from 2011 to 2015. We first completed a guide for Central California in close collaboration with stakeholders and with substantial new data from field monitoring and laboratory experiments (Wasson et al. 2014). The current guide is an update of the earlier one."
