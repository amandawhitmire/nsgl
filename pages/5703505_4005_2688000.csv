9,Abstract:,"The research reported in this paper is aimed specifically at the determination of the absorption of energy by a mooring system from an offshore platform as a result of its motion. This transfer of energy represents a ""mooring-â€‹induced damping"" and can be important for ship-like platforms in two situations, where the inherent damping from other sources is slight. These are roll motions during operations and surge motions of single-point moored platforms in survival conditions. Results of parametric studies based on a non- linear mooring dynamics simulation are presented for damping induced by horizontal motions (surge, sway and yaw) and vertical motions (heave, roll and pitch). The results include variations in pretension, amplitude, frequency, scope, stiffness, drag coefficient and current."
