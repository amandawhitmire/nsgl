11,Abstract:,"Hundreds of citizen scientists monitor sandy beaches for the elusive California grunion, a marine fish with unique spawning habits. Grunion runs occur in the middle of the night, twice a month, after the highest tides associated with a full or new moon. Greeters attend a training workshop and then sign up for dates and sites to monitor during peak spawning season. They submit their observations via an interactive web site at www.Grunion.org and through a ""hotline"" phone number to be used by Pepperdine University researchers in various studies. Grunion Greeters also contribute to a massive collaboration between concerned residents and numerous scientists, agencies, municipalities and organizations cooperating to ensure protection of grunion and their eggs incubating beneath the sand."
