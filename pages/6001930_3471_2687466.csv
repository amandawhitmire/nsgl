14,Abstract:,"The effects of upright and plagiotropic stem orientation, temperature, and season on the regeneration of ""Arundo donax"" (giant reed) from stem fragments were studied for a period of more than 1 yr. In a temperature-​controlled experiment (16/8 h at 28�/16�C), successful regeneration (30%-80%) occurred from stem fragments with lengths ranging from 1 through 10 cm, even if split lengthwise, but only when the axillary bud was present and intact. Seasonal patterns in regeneration were observed in experiments in an unheated greenhouse with 0%-20% regeneration in the winter and 90%- 100% regeneration in summer. During spring, fragments from plagiotropic, or hanging, stems showed 30%-40% regeneration under the temperature-​controlled conditions, while only 0%- 10% of fragments from upright stems completed regeneration by rooting. Regeneration success and speed increased toward summer for both plagiotropic and upright stems, with 80%-90% and 80% regeneration rates, respectively. Exogenous indole- 3-acetic acid (IAA) increased rooting by upright stem fragments in spring to 30%-40%. The seasonal pattern of endogenous IAA in the new stems that grew from fragments of plagiotropic and upright stems was similar to the regeneration patterns but displayed a 4-6-wk lag period. Distribution of stem fragments could lead to the establishment of new ""A. donax"" stands."
