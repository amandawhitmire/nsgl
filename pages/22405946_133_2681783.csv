8,Abstract:,"Implications of multiple climate drivers for sea urchins were investigated across a spectrum of biological organization ranging from the urchin guild scale, to individual life history traits, to the geochemistry, material properties and porosity of sea urchin calcium carbonate skeletal tests. Using pink fragile sea urchins (Strongylocentr​otus fragilis) on the southern California upwelling margin as a model species, links between biological traits and environmental parameters in nature across multiple spatial and temporal scales revealed correlations with dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and temperature.Tem​poral trends in sea urchin populations assessed from trawl surveys conducted in southern California over the last 20 years (1994-2013) revealed changes in deep-sea urchin densities and depth distributions that coincide with trends in DO and pH on multidecadal and interdecadal (El Niño Southern Oscillation) time scales. The shallower urchin species(Lytechi​nus pictus) decreased in density in the upper 200 m by 80%, and the deeper S. fragilis increased in density by ~300%, providing the first evidence of habitat compression and expansion in sea urchin populations associated with secular and interdecadal variability in DO and pH. In this context, marketable food quality properties of the roe were compared between S. fragilis and the currently fished California red urchin, Mesocentrotus franciscanus, to assess the feasibility of developing a climate change-tolerant future S. fragilis trap fishery. Although roe color, texture, and resilience were similar between the two species, smaller and softer S. fragilis roe suggest it may only supplement, but not replace M. franciscanus in future fisheries. In comparisons across natural margin depth and climate gradients from 100-1100 m, S. fragilis exhibited reduced gonad production, smaller, weaker and more porous calcified tests in the Oxygen Minimum Zone (DO < 22 μmol kg-1)and pH Minimum Zone (in situ pH Total < 7.57) than those collected from less acidic and more oxygenated shelf and oxygen limiting zones above and the lower OMZ below. Thus S. fragilis may be more vulnerable to crushing predators if low oxygen, low pH OMZs continue to shoal and intensify in the future. This research highlights the utility of quantifying natural variability in species’ traits along natural gradients on upwelling margins to improve understanding about potential impacts of changing climate drivers."
