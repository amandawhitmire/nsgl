10,Abstract:,"In this dissertation I look at how Sitka Sound, Alaska came to be a single gear herring fishery and consider the question of whether it should remain a single gear fishery. In doing so I review the development of Pacific coast herring roe fisheries from California to Togiak Alaska and examine similarities and differences in management and fishery types. The following are reviewed: Chapter one: The city of Sitka, Sitka residents, and many fishermen, have proposed to the Board of Fisheries several times over the last twenty years to allocate a portion of Sitka Sound herring to a new fishery or gear type. There appears to be no end to the recurring proposals; therefore, a review of the development many provide insights into the perceived need for change and provide a basis upon which change, could be considered; Chapter two: fisheries management is reviewed; Chapter three: The Alaska Board of Fisheries structure and policy making process which includes a strong public input mechanism; Chapter four: general herring management is reviewed; In chapter five, I review the development of the Sitka Sound fishery including major management and policy changes, the implementation of limited entry, and the optimum number study. In chapter six I look at the issue of changing the Sitka Sound herring fishery."
