9,Abstract:,"Several years ago, the marine natural product manoalide (MLD), a non-steroidal sesterterpenoid​, was isolated from the sponge ""Luffariella variabilis"". The initial pharmacological evaluation of MLD undertaken in the laboratory revealed both analgesic and antiinflammator​y activity. Research with MLD up to the present time has suggested the following: MLD is a potent inhibitor of PLA2 (phospholipase A2). The mechanism of inactivation is irreversible and extremely potent. MLD has a potent in-vivo effect on the production of eicosanoids in mice, thus suggesting that this drug may be useful in treatment of disorders where eicosanoids have been shown to participate. MLD is currently being investigated as a candidate drug for the treatment of skin diseases where activation of phospholipases and the presence of eicosanoids have been documented."
