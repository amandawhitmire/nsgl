10,Abstract:,"As part of the Sea Grant Institutional Program at the University of California, the University of California Extension Office at UCSD carried out a survey of the need for courses in ocean engineering and related fields to enable them to plan course sequences that would meet the needs of would-be extension students in the area. This survey was carried out during the Grant Year 1970-1971 and included surveys of both student interest and industrial needs for trained personnel. Two separate surveys were conducted through the mail. In the first, present and past students of Extension courses in Oceanography and Ocean Engineering were polled; in the second, questionnaires were sent to representatives of local ocean-oriented industries. Follow-up interviews were conducted with four of the largest of the industries surveyed."
