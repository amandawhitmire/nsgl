13,Abstract:,"Aquaculture may be an effective approach for continuous roe production from echinoids, but requires prepared feeds for cost-​effectiveness. Prepared feeds have been shown to support gonadal production in several species of sea urchins. ""Strongylocentr​otus franciscanus"" is the major sea urchin species fished on the west coast of North America, and experiences a wide temperature range over its distribution from Baja California to Alaska. Its feeding and respiratory rates are directly related to temperature. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the effect of temperature on gonadal production in ""S. franciscanus"" fed prepared and natural foods."
