8,Abstract:,"Rather than identifying one or two overarching strategies for assessing socioeconomic value, I found that it is instead a dynamic process of considering a variety of strategies, as the benefits of restoration can differ across varying habitat scenarios. There are so many reasons that habitat restoration work is valuable: restoring fisheries habitat often protects communities from coastal flooding during storms, provides livelihoods through commercial fisheries, sustains recreation and tourism opportunities, and returns culturally important habitats to more natural states. Therefore, instead of a single answer, I developed a strategy that considers many options to describe the value of restoration, prioritizing them based on what is best for each habitat type. This blog post is written by Larissa Lee, USC Sea Grant Class of 2019 Knauss Fellow. At the end of her fellowship, she highlights lessons learned and provides insight into the year-long fellowship."
