9,Abstract:,"Hypophysectomy (pituitary removal) enables the investigator of pituitary function to perform the classic endocrine experiment -- determination of whether a gland is the source of a hormone in question by removing it and giving replacement therapy. Whereas it is generally assumed that few questions about the pituitary and its important hormones remain to be answered, new hormones are still being described (e.g., somatolactin). Futhermore, the procedure remains important for verification of the sensitivity of homologous radioimmunoassaâ€‹y procedures involving pituitary hormones, in view of the need for hormone-free blood as a negative control. This paper describes the technique."
