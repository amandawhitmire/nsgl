9,Abstract:,"Olfactory stimuli are cues for prey localization, homing and for social interactions in fishes. In order to be effective, however, chemicals dissolved in water must be brought into physical contact with the ciliated sensory epithelia in the sensory nasal sacs. Given the benthic habit of post-â€‹metamorphic flatfishes, it is not surprising that they have accessory nasal sacs. The systematic and evolutionary implications of variation in accessory nasal sac configurations among flatfishes and the potential diversity of nasal ventilatory mechanisms used by flatfishes are discussed."
