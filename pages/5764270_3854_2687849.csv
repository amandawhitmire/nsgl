13,Abstract:,"In recent years modern molecular biological and genetic approaches, have provided new insights into the mechanism(s) of microbial divalent manganese oxidation. This knowledge has, in turn, allowed researchers to consider the possible functions and selective advantages gained by bacteria that oxidize divalent manganese. In addition, it may even allow consideration of the role of divalent manganese-â€‹oxidizing bacteria in controlling the properties of the minerals they form, such as their surface area and charge, and composition. Three model bacterial divalent manganese oxidation systems are considered."
