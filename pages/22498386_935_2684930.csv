24,Abstract:,"As sea levels continue to rise, coastal communities will need to adapt their shorelines in order to manage risk and create greater social and ecological resilience to a changing landscape. Adapting to sea level rise will be challenging; coastal planners typically have limited resources, and they will need to deploy these as effectively and efficiently as possible. A critical tool for this process is a science-based framework for developing shoreline adaptation strategies that are locally appropriate, reflect the values and priorities of the community, and work with natural coastal processes (i.e. Adaptation Framework). The goal of this Adaptation Framework user guide is to enable planners and other coastal decision makers to identify, evaluate, and prioritize adaptation strategies to manage risk in a way that transparently considers multiple benefits. The resources that have been developed to support the framework are intended to help coastal decision-makers to efficiently identify a range of natural and nature-based, landscape-scale adaptation strategies that can address coastal climate change vulnerabilities​. The framework also provides guidance enabling coastal decision makers to evaluate how well these adaptation strategies achieve coastal community objectives and prioritize their implementation. We demonstrate the application of the user guide by illustrating the decision-making process with examples from two regions of the Marin County shoreline: Novato and Corte Madera OLUs. The Framework is organized in five main steps which, while linear on paper, will ultimately be an iterative process. Step one assesses the vulnerability of the place focusing on the sources of the vulnerability. Step two identifies nature-based adaptation measures that are suitable to the place and also addresses the vulnerabilities identified in step one. Step three asks the user to articulate goals and desired future scenarios and step four asks users to organize the available measures into configurations that meet those desired future goals. Step five evaluates the trade-offs between the different strategies. We provide general guidance on each of the five main steps of the Adaptation Framework process and point to key resources."
