10,Abstract:,This fact sheet discusses the California Department of Health Services paralytic shellfish poisoning monitoring program for sport and commercial shellfish growing areas. The public and local health agencies are alerted to any changes detected in toxin levels. An annual quarantine is placed on sport harvesting of mussels for food from May 1 to October 31. Elevated toxin levels sometimes require local quarantines during the nonquarantine period. Causative organisms and PSP symptoms are described. This fact sheet is also available in Spanish (CUIMR-​G-​91-​005).
