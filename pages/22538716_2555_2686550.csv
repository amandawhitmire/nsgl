21,Abstract:,"We investigated the effects of a wildfire on stream physical, chemical and biological characteristics in a Mediterranean climate, comparing stream community structure and consumer resource use in burned versus unburned catchments in Santa Barbara County, CA, U.S.A. Canopy cover was lower and water temperature was higher in streams draining basins where the riparian vegetation burned than in streams in unburned basins or burned basins where riparian vegetation remained intact. Stream flow and suspended sediment concentrations during large post-fire storms and wet season nutrient levels were higher in burned than unburned catchments, with increased sedimentation after flood peaks. A year after fires, algal levels were highest in streams where riparian vegetation burned and lowest in streams in burned basins where the riparian canopy remained intact. In contrast, streams in burned basins had lower particulate organic matter, detritivore and predator levels than unburned basins, regardless of whether riparian vegetation burned. Where present, southern California steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were extirpated from burned basins. Algivore densities were high in streams with burned riparian vegetation for two post‐fire years before declining to unburned stream levels. Shredder densities rebounded in streams in burned basins with intact riparian vegetation, but remained low for 4 years where riparian vegetation burned. Predatory invertebrate densities increased at sites where trout were eliminated by wildfire. Hydrogen stable isotope analysis indicated that the diets of most invertebrate taxa in streams with burned riparian vegetation a year after fires were comprised of a higher proportion of algal material than riparian detritus relative to invertebrates in streams with intact riparian vegetation. Wildfire impacts on stream food webs are determined, in part, by fire severity in the riparian zone. Streams with burned riparian canopies supported algal-based food webs and streams with intact riparian canopies sustained detrital-based food webs. Fire affected basal resources (nutrients, light, allochthonous inputs) with bottom-up effects on primary producers and consumers, but top-down effects were decoupled at the trophic link between invertebrate predators and primary consumers."
