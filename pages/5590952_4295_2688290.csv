13,Abstract:,"The chemical constituents of a colonial zoanthid of the genus ""Zoanthus"" were investigated as part of a program to study toxic marine organisms from the Visakhapatnam coast of India. The colonial zoanthids, which occur as dense mats on intertidal rocks, can eject jets of water when they are squashed or otherwise disturbed. If the spray comes into contact with a victim's eyes, it immediately causes tears followed by prolonged redness and pain; irritant effects can last for up to a week and are not limited to this species alone. A series of alkaloids called zoanthamines was isolated that were presumed to cause the irritant effects, but these compounds are now known to act as anti-â€‹inflammatory agents. The zoanthamines comprise a new class of alkaloids."
