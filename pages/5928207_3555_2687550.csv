9,Abstract:,"Beliefs about profitability of different locations are the most important determinants of location choice for commercial fishing, but they are unobservable. The crux of the modeling problem is that while individual discrete choices can be observed, as can catch and revenue histories we do not really know how individuals process their data into beliefs. This paper looks at three aspects of information processing: the choice between structural and reduced-form models, information decay, and complexities of spatial search and information sharing."
