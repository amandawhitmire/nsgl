10,Abstract:,"One of the most remarkable sights in the western Pacific is a perennial swarm of 1.5 million golden medusae (""Mastigias"" sp.) crowded into a land-locked marine lake in Palau, Micronesia. However, in December 1998, the golden- medusae disappeared. Field measurements, including temperature and salinity depth profiles, ""Mastigias"" medusae population sizes, and the distribution of scyphistomae in 'Jellyfish Lake' between 1979 and 1999 were integrated with laboratory-​based experiments on the effects of salinity, temperature, sunscreen and zooxanthellae enrichment on ""Mastigias"" scyphistomae or medusae. These studies, described here, indicated that the disappearance of medusae was due to physical changes in lake structure, including a substantial increase in temperature, initiated by the 1997-98 El Nino. Also discussed are coincident changes in three other 'jellyfish lakes' in Palau."
