9,Abstract:,"Ocean litter is a pervasive problem at local, regional, and global scales with a wide range of consequences to human health, the environment, and the economy. Immediate, collaborative action to reduce and prevent ocean litter will ensure that California communities, environments, and economies remain productive and vibrant. The Ocean Protection Council (OPC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’​s Marine Debris Program (NOAA MDP) present this update to OPC’s 2008 An Implementation Strategy for the California Ocean Protection Council Resolution to Reduce and Prevent Ocean Litter. The 2018 California Ocean Litter Prevention Strategy: Addressing Marine Debris from Source to Sea (Strategy) will provide structure and guidance for OPC and California stakeholders to efficiently address this pressing issue over the next six years.Much of OPC’s work on ocean litter began in 2007, when OPC adopted a resolution entitled “Reducing and Preventing Marine Debris.” OPC then initiated a steering committee to publish an Implementation Strategy in 2008, which laid out a plan to implement the resolution. The 2008 Strategy served as a powerful and effective document to promote action on addressing ocean litter in California. Since 2008, many of the actions described in the document have either been accomplished or are in progress. For example, the single-use plastic carryout bag ban was ratified by California voters in 2016, and the State Water Resources Control Board’s Trash Amendments were adopted in 2015. While we have made great strides in addressing ocean litter in California, our understanding of the issue has changed considerably in the last decade. For example, the investigation of microplastics’ presence in aquatic ecosystems and impacts on marine life has increased dramatically over the last ten years.OPC and the NOAA MDP have partnered to update the 2008 Strategy. The NOAA MDP is authorized by the United States Congress through the Marine Debris Act, signed into law in 2006 and amended in 2012. The Act requires the program to “identify, determine sources of, assess, prevent, reduce, and remove marine debris and address the adverse impacts of marine debris on the economy of the United States, marine environment, and navigation safety.” The NOAA MDP has prioritized supporting and facilitating the creation of collaborative action plans around the country. Similar to other regions, this 2018 update expands the previous Strategy to include projects of a variety of scales and scopes so that entities including government agencies, industry, academia, nonprofits, and tribes can collaborate on meaningful contributions to reducing ocean litter in California.The content of the Strategy was generated from a wide range of stakeholder input, gathered during two workshops and two rounds of public comment between May 2017 and February 2018. The Strategy includes OPC Priorities to address ocean litter and stakeholder-​identified Goals, Objectives, and Action Items to address ocean litter.The OPC Priorities are tailored to how OPC works and outlines the activities OPC will take on over the next six years to address ocean litter. This means that the priorities are framed around developing and implementing policy, coordinating among state agencies, providing funding for catalytic and innovative projects, and providing the best available science for government decision-​making. The OPC Priorities were developed by OPC staff and were revised through stakeholder feedback and public comment. The OPC Priorities are meant to support and enhance many of the Goals, Objectives, and Action Items developed by California stakeholders.In contrast to the OPC Priorities, the Stakeholder Goals, Objectives and Action Items were developed and revised by a wide range of stakeholders including grassroots organizations, fishermen, scientists, wastewater treatment managers, and the plastics industry. Stakeholders were engaged through two workshops and through public comment periods on the draft document. The first workshop provided an opportunity to brainstorm Action Items, and the second workshop provided an opportunity to refine the Goals, Objectives, and Action Items in the first draft of the Strategy. In summary, this document provides a holistic, collaborative strategy for addressing ocean litter in California, with a focus on reducing land-based litter at its source. It focuses on high impact Action Items that entities can commit to working on over the next six years. The document provides both guidance and flexibility so that Lead and Partner Organizations can work collaboratively to pursue funding (where needed) and implement these Action Items. Partnership across sectors is necessary to reduce and prevent ocean litter and ensure a healthy coast and ocean for current and future generations of Californians."
