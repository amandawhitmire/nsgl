10,Abstract:,"The purposes of this study were to determine whether the cyclodiene pesticide heptachlor, a known environmental endocrine disrupter among vertebrates, has similar effects on crustacean molting hormones. The authors also studied whether P450 and stress proteins could be useful markers of such endocrine disruption in decapod crustacean larvae. Earlier work had shown that lobster hepatopancreas CYP45 mRNA levels correlated with circulating steroid molting hormone titers. These results were compared with larval molting rates and ecdysteroid molting hormone titers to examine the effects of heptachlor on a crustacean endocrine cycle."
