11,Abstract:,"Organisms use a variety of cellular mechanisms to avoid the effects of toxins. One strategy utilizes transport mechanisms to actually prevent the entry and accumulation of toxins in the cells. These toxin avoidance mechanisms, which presumably evolved in response to natural toxins, can also be used to counter the effects of compounds introduced into the environment by human activities. The authors of this article discuss the use of transport mechanism strategies to protect against toxins and the possible use of these mechanisms as biomarkers indicative of exposure to anthropogenic toxins. The characteristics of transport mechanisms, including biology, genetics, and molecular properties are also discussed."
