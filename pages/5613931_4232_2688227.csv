9,Abstract:,"Technologies to extend market lives of fresh fish have focused on the period when the product becomes unacceptable to the consumer. There is, however, a paucity of information on initial changes of fresh fish quality, i.e., on the prime or grade A market lives. Factors responsible for loss of prime fish quality, with emphasis on biochemical reactions, are discussed in this review. Technologies designed to extend the market life of fresh fish include partial freezing, ionizing radiation, modified atmospheres, and chemical treatments. With the possible exception of partial freezing, these methods do not extend the grade A market life of fresh fish products. In order to lengthen grade A market life of fresh fish it will be necessary for technologists to devise ways to control endogenous biochemical reactions that contribute to loss in prime quality."
