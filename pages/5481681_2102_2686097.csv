9,Abstract:,"The beneficial effect of geosynthetic inclusions on the shear strength of compacted soils is well known. Soil reinforcement in the form of sheets or strips of synthetic fabric and continuous or randomly distributed fibers has been shown to increase soil strength. However, there are few data on the effects of synthetic inclusions on the dynamic properties of saturated soils. The objective of this study was to investigate the dynamic strength of saturated sand reinforced with randomly distributed synthetic fibers. The study was undertaken to determine if geosynthetic materials can be used to increase the resistance of sand fills to earthquakes and reduce their susceptibility to liquefaction."
