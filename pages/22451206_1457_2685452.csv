8,Abstract:,"Commercial aquaculture operations, like traditional agricultural operations, sometimes face legal challenges from neighbors raising concerns about farm operations. Nuisance lawsuits filed against agricultural operations often involve allegations by neighboring property owners that the odor, dust, or noise associated with farming is interfering with their abilityto enjoy and use their property. In general, “right-to-farm” legislation protects agricultural operations from such nuisance claims when certain conditions are satisfied. This document examines California's right-to-farm legislation and how it applies to commercial aquaculture."
