9,Abstract:,"This is a report of the University of Southern California's (USC) twelfth year of participation in the National Sea Grant Program. The Sea Grant program, funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,​ supports marine research, education and advisory services at several universities in the coastal and Great Lakes regions. Sea Grant research is primarily applied research, and USC, like every Sea Grant program, has a commitment to work with representatives​ of the public and industry to solve marine and coastal problems of importance to the region. The theme of our program and the title of this report, ""The Planning and Management of California's Coastal Resources,"" reflects that commitment. At USC, Sea Grant researchers can draw on substantial facilities and a long tradition of excellence in marine research. The Sea Grant program is one of several marine programs within the university's Institute for Marine and Coastal Studies, founded in 1975. The institute administers a marine science center and a conference center on Catalina Island; a major research vessel, the VELERO IV, and other research ships; a Center for Marine Transportation Studies; a research laboratory on the harbor waterfront; and other facili ties. Individual academic units at USC, particularly the Allan Hancock Foundation, have been active in marine research since the early 1900s."
