10,Abstract:,"Reported here are the characteristics of temporal variability in satellite-based measurements of chlorophyll concentrations in the ocean off southern California. About 20-25% of the variance is produced by a periodic annual cycle with peak values in winter. Analysis of ship-based measurements indicates that the winter peak is only characteristic of the upper portion of the euphotic zone; total water column chlorophyll peaks during the spring upwelling season. Satellite studies of intra-annual variability are modulated by strong 5- to 6-day oscillation in the availability of usable imagery, resulting from a combination of satellite orbital dynamics and an oscillation in cloud cover. The cloud cover oscillation, which is also present in coastal winds, undoubtedly affects the ocean surface and biases the data obtained by satellites."
