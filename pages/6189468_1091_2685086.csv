9,Abstract:,"Vibrio cholera, V. parahaemolyticu​s and V. vulnificus are notorious bacteria that cause debilitating disease worldwide through contamination of drinking water and seafood. Evidence suggests these bacteria are naturally occurring in saltwater ecosystems. However, there has not been a study that links the presence of Vibrios in recreational water and human health. This study examined the occurrence of Vibrios at two Californian recreational beaches, Doheney State Beach and Avalon Beach on Catalina Island. Water samples were collected from 28 May to 4 July 2007 from several different sampling sites and at different times of the day. The samples were enriched for Vibrios using alkaline peptone water. Genomic DNA was extracted for PCR analysis. Species specific and toxin specific primers were chosen to indicate the presence of different Vibrio species and test for those Vibrios that carry toxin producing genes. Preliminary results indicated the presence of V. parahaemolyticu​s in 45% and V. cholera in 20% of the enriched samples. No samples tested positive for V. vulnificus or any of the toxin genes. This study will contribute to our understanding of the naturally occurring bacterial pathogens found in marine recreational water."
