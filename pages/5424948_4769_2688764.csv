9,Abstract:,"During recent studies of Fiji sponges, the authors repeatedly noticed that cytotoxic crude extracts afford unique natural products. This stimulated the investigation of an uncommon purple-blue sponge whose extract was toxic to P388 mouse leukemia at 25 ug/mL. Two monosubstituted pyridines were the novel components of this sponge and they are described in this paper."
