9,Abstract:,"Reproductively viable tilapiine hybrids have arisen in aquaculture settings before escaping to the wild. The author of this work conducted microsatellite DNA marker studies of 139 tilapia from ten locations (6 feral, 4 in culture) in southern California. Genetic similarities to a worldwide tilapia genetic database were compared by formulating a neighbor-â€‹joining dendrogram. Because genetic material of certain prohibited species was found to be present in feral stocks in California, the author recommends that a regulatory structure to control exotic tilapia be based on DNA microsatellite markers rather than morphometric and meristic data."
