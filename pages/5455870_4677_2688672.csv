10,Abstract:,"Understanding the physiology and endocrinology of salmonid development should lead to an increased contribution of hatchery-reared salmonids to the fishery. Current knowledge of the endocrine physiology of smoltification is reviewed here, with emphasis on the implications of recent advances for hatchery practices. In addition, new studies on larval development and growth are described."
