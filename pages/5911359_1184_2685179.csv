12,Abstract:,"To aid in the restoration of white, pink, and green abalone, productive marine protected areas (MPAs) need to be selected. In this study researchers used spatially explicit fishery data (1950-1995) to identify the most productive marine areas in southern California. They also compared the density, sizes number of juveniles, and estimates of potential egg production among two no-take MPAs and one fished area to assess the efficacy of MPAs."
