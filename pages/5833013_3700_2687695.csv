11,Abstract:,"Fish with closed swim bladders suffer barotrauma and other stresses associated with rapid decompression when brought to the surface for tagging. This and other difficulties (infection at externally attached tags; regurgitation of baited tags) prompted the authors of this study to develop scuba techniques to surgically implant acoustic tags at feasible depths. They used longlines and modified trolling gear to bring greenspotted rockfish ""Sebastes chlorostictus"" and bocaccio ""S. paucispinus"" to 20 m, where divers implanted the tags. Recording receivers on the seafloor enabled tracking for three months."
