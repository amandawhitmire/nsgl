12,Abstract:,"The objective was to examine the applicability and consistency of a previously developed model reflecting relationship between digital spectral data and estuarine chlorophyll A concentratiton. The approach involved collection and laboratory analysis of water quality samples simultaneous acquisition of airborne Daedalus MSS 1260 data, selection of channels and their ratios, application and evaluation of models, and production of final results. The results included prediction of chlorophyss A for two dates composed of high and low freshwater inflow conditions based on the same wavelength channels and their ratios."
