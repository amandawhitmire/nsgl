8,Abstract:,"On open coasts such as those of the Californias, ocean waves provide the destructive power as well as much of the set-up that erodes beaches and overtops and floods coastal structures. However, the elevation of mean sea level, the tides and storm surge largely determine the degree of damage that waves can inflict on the shoreline. On January 16-18, 1988, a remarkable winter storm approached and collided with the coasts of California and Baja California. Were it not for some fortuitous conditions, the damage could have been much worse. The purpose of this paper is to examine the details of the coastal sea level related to this storm, and to describe how the different contributing factors varied along the coast and in time. It is concluded that we should be able to enhance the possibility of short-term warnings of coastal damamge, using readily available information."
