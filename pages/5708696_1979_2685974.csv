10,Abstract:,"Spill reports indicate that a significant number of spills are the result of Human and Organization Factors (HOF). This report summarizes organizational and managerial findings, and proposes corresponding recommendations​, based on a program of research conducted at two major locations: Chevron USA Products Company Refinery in Richmond, California and Arco Marine Incorporated shipping operations in Long Beach, California. Both organizations were voluntary participants in a joint industry and regulatory agency research project. The aim of this part of the project is to identify organizational and managerial practices, policies, problems, and potential problems, analyze them, and then make recommendations that offer potential solutions to those circumstances which pose a human and/or organizational error risk."
