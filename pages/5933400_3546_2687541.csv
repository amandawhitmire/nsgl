11,Abstract:,"A flow diagram and worksheets are recommended in documenting a hazard analysis and final HACCP plan. The accuracy of the flow diagram is critical in conducting a hazard analysis. Hazard analysis should contain information to justify the identification of the proper critical control points, and information in the HACCP plan must explain the details for each HACCP step. Experience has shown that the five items listed in the basic flow diagram here need to be addressed in establishing a HACCP system. While there is no standardized or mandated format for the flow diagram or worksheets, the information should be arranged in a progression that explains the thought process for the analysis and the sequential steps to take. The Flow Diagram, Hazard-Analysis and HACCP plan worksheets presented here are provided as examples. To view examples of completed flow diagrams and completed worksheets, refer to the HACCP: Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Training Curriculum, 4th ed.(FLSGP-E-01-001), developed by the National Seafood HACCP Alliance for Training and Education or visit the following web sites: <http://nsgl.gso.uri.edu/flsgp/flsgpe01001.pdf>; <http://seafood.ucdavis.edu/haccp/Plans.htm>."
