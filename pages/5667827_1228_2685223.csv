10,Abstract:,"The hope that biotechnology will permit the identification of geographic sources of recruitment to most marine animal populations is not well supported either by logic or fact. Genetic studies are, nevertheless, contributing new insights into the structure and biology of marine animal populations. One new insight is that sharp genetic subdivisions can occur in continuously distributed species, particularly those spanning biogeographic boundaries. An even more widespread observation is of very slight but significant microgeographic genetic heterogeneity embedded within broad regions of genetically very similar populations. Examples of the latter from the California Current are presented for the barnacle ""Balanus glandula"" and the northern anchovy ""Engraulis mordax""."
