14,Abstract:,"The creators of the 'Gulf Oyster Project' aimed to (a) document the economic and operational characteristics of currently available commercial oyster post-harvest processing (PHP) technologies, (b) assess the sensory characteristics of various PHP and new oyster value-added products (VAP), and (c) develop and distribute factual consumer education and technology transfer materials for use throughout the region. In year 2 of the project, key activities were: (a) exploratory analysis of the demographics of oyster consumers, (b) studies on the marketability of VAP and PHP oyster products among Gulf states and California consumer groups, and (c) intensification of VAP and PHP oyster product promotion. This final report presents the research and activities in detail. (See also FLSGP-H-04-003, a related publication.)"
