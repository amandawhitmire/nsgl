10,Abstract:,"It is only relatively recently that the utility of applying tissue culture techniques to crustaceans has become apparent. It is paradoxical that there presently are not any established crustacean cell lines. Crustacean organ culture has been utilized for decades and has proved to be an extremely valuable model system for the investigation of many physiological processes (e.g., osmoregulation, neurophysiology​, endocrinology). The lack of established cell lines is likely due to the relative scarcity of scientists utilizing in-vitro crustacean systems and not to any inherent technical difficulties. Major advances in crustacean cell culture can be expected in the near future due to the current multidisciplina​ry interest in the biology and aquaculture of crustaceans. This review documents some historical aspects of crustacean organ culture and details the primary disciplinary thrusts of research efforts in the field."
