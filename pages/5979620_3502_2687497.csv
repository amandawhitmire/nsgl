11,Abstract:,"Two underwater volcanic pinnacles located off Cape Edgecumbe, Alaska, harbor a large population of lingcod (""Ophiodon elongatus""), and include rocky habitats that contain a higher diversity and density of fishes than in surrounding areas. In 1998, the area was closed to all bottomfish fishing in an effort to create a permanent reserve for lingcod and other demersal fishes. Its efficacy is dependent on the frequency and range of movements of lingcod inhabiting the reserve. Similarly, the efficacy of a reserve in augmenting adjacent fisheries through emigration of larger fishes (i.e., spillover) is also dependent on movements of the protected species. This study estimated the residence time and rates of emigration of female lingcod in the newly created Edgecumbe Reserve to determine if the reserve can conserve populations and/or augment fisheries outside the reserve. The authors developed a yield per recruit model to predict the potential for spillover from a system of reserves."
