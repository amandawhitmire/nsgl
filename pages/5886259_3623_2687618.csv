10,Abstract:,"Researchers recently undertook a survey of the constituents of the hemocytes of the ascidian ""Styela plicata"" in an effort to identify molecules with antimicrobial or metal binding potential. This paper describes the structural elucidation of a modified pentapeptide from ""S. plicata"" hemocytes which they designate as tunichrome Sp.-1."
