9,Abstract:,"The proportion of ovigerous females in the lobster catch is generally lower than anticipated from the proportion of mature females and the duration of the ovigerous period. Among the hypotheses that may be entertained to explain this discrepancy is interference with reproduction by events associated with molting. The possible antagonism between the processes might be expressed as interference by the events of premolt with the secondary vitellogenesis occasioned by long-day photoperiod onset (LDO). This hypothesis is tested by varying the timing of LDO with respect to the molt. The hypothesis that short-day photoperiod of a certain duration is sufficient for LDO to elicit a vitellogenic response is also tested. The role of temperature in modifying the relationships between photoperiod, molting, and extrusion is examined, along with whether or not the occurrence of extrusion is influenced by the `organismic' independent variables of previous molting and reproductive history and individual variation, as well as by the environmental independent variables of photoperiod and temperature."
