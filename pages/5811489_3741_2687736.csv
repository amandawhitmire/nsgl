11,Abstract:,"""Bugula neritina"", an arborescent bryozoan and the source of the bryostatins, harbors bacteria in the funicular cords and larvae. This study focused on the symbionts found in ""B. neritina"" larvae, and whether they influence production of bryostatins. Some of the objectives were to obtain a small subunit rRNA gene sequence from the larval symbiont, to analyze the phylogenetic affiliations of the symbiont and to explore whether the symbiont can be eliminated from colonies. Results showed the larval symbionts of ""B. neritina"" to be a novel type of gamma proteobacteria, and not readily isolated."
