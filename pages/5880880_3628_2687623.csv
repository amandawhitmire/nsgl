12,Abstract:,"""Mytilus californianus"" is a filter feeder that removes seaweed particulates, phytoplankton, and their byproducts from the water. The gills of this mussel express high multixenobiotic resistance and transport activity that is related to the mammalian p-glycoprotein (p-gp). The high p- gp observed in mussel gills may provide the mussel protection from natural toxins in the diet. To test this hypothesis, extracts of various seaweeds and phytoplankton found in and around the mussel habitat were examined for presence of p-gp substrates by competition assays with a fluorescent dye substrate."
