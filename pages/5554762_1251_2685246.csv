11,Abstract:,"This report can be considered a summary of the state of San Diego Bay with respect to its environmental and management issues. The San Diego Interagency Water Quality Panel is charged by the California Legislature with improving communication among organizations responsible for San Diego Bay; to accomplish this, the agency sponsored a symposium in 1990 to examine the water quality issues facing the bay. This document contains a summary of the symposium, and the agency's conclusions and recommendations to the California Legislature (the result of analysis of the symposium's findings). Appendices provide a list of the agency's membership and symposium participants."
