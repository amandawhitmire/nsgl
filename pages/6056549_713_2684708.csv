13,Abstract:,"The Salton Sea is a highly saline lake that has long supported sportfishery and large populations of fish-eating birds. A study was initiated in 1999 to assess the status of orangemouth corvina, bairdiella and tilapia. Tilapia was the most abundant of the four species. Harsh conditions at the Salton Sea have led to erratic reproduction and survival rates and unstable age structures for its resident fishes. The boom-and-bust dynamics of tilapia and other fish populations in the Sea have major consequences for fish-eating bird populations, for other components of the ecosystem, and for the recreational value of the lake."
