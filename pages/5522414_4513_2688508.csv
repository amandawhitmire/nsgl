9,Abstract:,"Every source of risk can be reduced, and safety increased, by reducing the likelihood of a hazardous event, or by reducing the potential consequences associated with the hazardous event. In the context of offshore platforms, one should be prepared to choose what risks will be tolerated or accepted, and how much resources one is willing to invest. This paper outlines several complementary engineering approaches as background for judging reliability targets for offshore platforms. These approaches are illustrated with development of reliability targets for design of new and requalification of existing platforms."
