10,Abstract:,"It has been known for more than ten years that the phenomenon known as Bragg scattering in solid-state physics has an analog in the propagation of water waves over a ripple bottom. Earlier treatments of the underlying theory start with the assumption of irrotational flow of an inviscid fluid and then by various schemes approximate the boundary conditions. This paper approaches the problem differently, exploiting the fluid-sheet theory (GN theory) of A. E. Green and P. M. Naghdi (1986). The GN Level II theory used in this paper yields satisfactory predictions for shallow-water waves with steepness almost up to breaking. As a consequence, the GN equations seem particularly appropriate for examining the effect of these ratios on Bragg scattering. In addition, by taking small values of these ratios, the GN theory yields results compatible with those obtained by perturbation methods."
