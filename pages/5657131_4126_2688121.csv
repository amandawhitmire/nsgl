12,Abstract:,"The red abalone, ""Haliotis rufescens"" (a gastropod mollusc), is a resource of major commercial importance, the focus of recent technological developments for improvements in intensive cultivation, and a uniquely tractable model for dissection of the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling early development, larval morphogenesis, metamorphosis, and growth. ""Haliotis"" larvae, like the planktonic larvae from many marine invertebrates, recognize specific environmental cues that induce settlement and initiate metamorphosis. To help resolve details of these regulatory processes not readily accessible in the intact multicellular larva, a procedure was developed to cultivate cells from the ""Haliotis"" larva."
