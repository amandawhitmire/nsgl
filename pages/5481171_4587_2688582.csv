8,Abstract:,"Bathymetric sidescan systems use an estimate of the phase difference between spatially separated receiver elements to infer depth. In the hybrid sonar scenario, each receiver is an array that can be used to generate a number of narrow beams. Assuming that a pair of spatially separated beams insonifies largely the same seafloor area, the phase measurement can be made within this beam pair. A simple version of this design was implemented using the simulation capabilities of REVGEN (REVerberation GENerator), a high-fidelity sonar simulation program. The computer simulations indicate that the hybrid system offers more robust bathymetric performance, compared to the sidescan design, in the presence of volume reverberation, ambient noise and multipath interference."
