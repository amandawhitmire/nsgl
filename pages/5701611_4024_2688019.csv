11,Abstract:,"Soft corals, along with hydroids and starfish, have proven over the years to be some of the most prolific sources for a number of interesting steroidal structures. As a part of a program to isolate new biologically-â€‹active compounds from marine octocorals, researchers turned their attention to organisms abundant in predator-rich habitats. ""Ctenocella pectinata"" is a large sea whip very common along the coast of Western Australia. The structures of the three major chemical constituents isolated from the extract of this organism are reported here."
