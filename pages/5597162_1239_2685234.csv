10,Abstract:,"The smoltification-​associated thyroid hormone (thyroxine) rise is considered a reliable indicator of readiness for seaward migration in coho salmon ""Oncorhynchus kisutch"". Timing of this thyroxine rise is lunar-phased; the major thyroxine peak is associated with the new moon nearest the vernal equinox in northern California. Preliminary results indicate that nocturnal illumination of hatchery raceways can interfere with the magnitude of thyroxine rise in the developing smolt."
