12,Abstract:,"The Marine Life Management Act (MLMA) requires ""external peer review of the scientific basis of marine living resources management documents"". The MLMA goes on to say that ""at a minimum, these documents include fishery research protocols [7704], fishery research plans [7062.1], and fishery management plans"" (FMP) [7075(a)]. To accomplish the review, ""the department (the California Department of Fish and Game-DFG) may enter into an agreement with one or more outside entities that are significantly involved with researching and understanding marine fisheries and are not advocacy organizations."" DFG contracted with the California Sea Grant Extension Program (SGEP) at the University of California, Davis to set up and administer the peer reviews. No precedent existed for the review process within DFG, and DFG gave SGEP a free hand in deciding what to do and how to do it. During 2001 and 2002, peer reviews were conducted of four fishery management plans: Nearshore, White Seabass, Market Squid, and the Abalone Recovery and Management Plan. In this paper the SGEP team involved with the peer reviews presents an overview of the peer review process and analyzes those elements of the process that have worked and those that need to be revised in the future."
