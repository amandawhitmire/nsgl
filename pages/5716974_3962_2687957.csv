11,Abstract:,"Fire and Life Safety Assessment and Indexing Methodology II (FLAIM II) incorporates information concerning human organizational factors into the evaluation of offshore platform and terminal safety. The methodology is based on assigning values for both likelihood and consequence in order to determine relative risk for each category of hazard. Highest risk categories can then be targeted for risk reduction. Training of risk assessors is divided into informational sessions, followed by hands-on use of the FLAIM II methodology."
