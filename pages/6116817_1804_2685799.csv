9,Abstract:,"Seasonal water limitation exerts a strong ecological filter on stream communities in semi-arid regions. A major population limitation for riparian willow and poplar trees is desiccation in the first year from declining river flows following germination. We investigated survivorship of first-year riparian seedlings to simulated river stage declines, focusing on the three dominant species in California's San Joaquin Basin: Fremont cottonwood, Goodding's black willow, and narrow-leaved willow. Seedlings grown in mesocosms were subjected to water table decline rates typical in spring on unregulated and regulated rivers. We compared the species' differences in survival time and fit the empirical data to accelerated failure time (AFT) models that predicted time until death as a function of drawdown rate, initial seedling size and maternal line. We used AIC to select the most parsimonious model for each species. Water table decline rates ≥6 cm/day were fully lethal to all species, whereas ≤1 cm/day had no effect compared to a stable water table (>63% survival). At an intermediate rate (3 cm/day) survival varied most among species (12- 38%) and was lowest for cottonwood. For all species the time to peak mortality was negatively correlated with drawdown rate, indicating a cumulative effect of water stress on survival. The best failure time models included drawdown rate as the single parameter for willows, and rate and initial size for cottonwood. Across the range of survivable drawdown rates (≤4 cm/day), Goodding's black willow sustain >20% higher survivorship over the other species after 30-40 days of stage decline. Current river management practices in the San Joaquin Basin have a disproportionat​ely-​large impact on spring runoff, and stage declines in most years are greater than can be sustained by seedlings. Using AFT model results we simulated non-lethal flow scenarios for the Tuolumne River in wet years that did not increase the overall discharge volume."
