10,Abstract:,"Global Climate Change (GCC) is projected have significant negative effects on biological ecosystems. Coastal (polar and temperate) and estuarine ecosystems in particular will experience alterations in numerous environmental conditions including increased temperature, decreased dissolved oxygen (DO), modified salinity regimes, and decreased pH from changes in carbon chemistry, some of which will occur concomitantly. Early-life stages of fishes living in these ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to the described environmental changes projected by GCC due to potential reduction in stress responses and acclimation capacity (e.g. fishes evolved to extreme environments), as well as developmental and activity energy requirements. Since predation pressure is high on early-life stages (relative to adults) the energy needed for predator avoidance strategies may be compromised if GCC alterations require additional energy for physiological responses.All fishes have a set of optimal physiological set points in which energetic processes are most efficient with adequate energy allocation for basic maintenance mechanisms such as growth, reproduction, and activity. However, depending on evolutionary history (i.e. stable or fluctuating habitats) and plasticity, fish may have wide or narrow ranges for physiological performance. Fishes with the narrowest windows for physiological performance are predicted to be most sensitive to GCC. As environment conditions change due to GCC, physiological performance of fishes may shift to sub-optimal conditions in which energetically costly mechanisms are upregulated to maintain homeostasis. Certain physiological and biochemical processes are highly dependent on temperature, pH, and oxygen availability (e.g. blood and tissue pH, osmolality, cellular metabolism) and hence, maintaining homeostasis of these processes are important for optimal performance. Sub-optimal performance, if not physiologic​ally compensated for, can become a chronic stressor, and lead to activation of energetically costly response mechanisms. Early-life stages may be most affected by sub-optimal environmental conditions having to balance energy between physiology and avoiding the heightened predation pressure. For example, juvenile fish energetic demands are driven by development and growth such that multiple environmental stressors may create trade-offs, both physiological (e.g. energy allocation for stress response mechanisms and growth and metabolism) and behavioral (e.g. foraging activity and avoiding predation). In this dissertation, I examined the effects of multiple GCC factors on fish performance from diverse habitats including polar coasts (McMurdo Sound, Antarctica), temperate coasts (Bodega-Bay, CA), and temperate estuaries (San Francisco-​Sacramento Bay-Delta, CA). I used an integrative approach assessing fish responses across biological scales including individual physiology and behavior, social and group behavior, as well as predator-prey interactions to better understand how individual physiological and behavioral responses to GCC conditions may influence populations through community interactions."
