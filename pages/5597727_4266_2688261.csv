10,Abstract:,"This paper presents a computer model of a novel device for distilling freshwater from seawater, which operates without a direct heat source. The device is powered by a salinity difference in an open cycle absorption heat pump. The basic device consists of two evacuated chambers and two heat exchanger plates. In the evacuated heat pump chamber the temperature rises in a falling film of saturated bittern as this absorbs vapor produced by an adjacent film of seawater. This elevated temperature then drives a single seawater distillation stage producing freshwater. Advantages and disadvantages of this novel desalination approach are contrasted with conventional fossil- fueled and solar-powered distillation."
