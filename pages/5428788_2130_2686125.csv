8,Abstract:,"As offshore oil and gas exploration and production increase along our coastal waters, the benefits of economic activity come into conflict with environmental issues. For seaport enterprises, offshore oil and gas development represents not only a business opportunity for facility development and service delivery but also an opportunity to help manage environmental impacts in that part of the coastal zone for which it has jurisdiction. A research framework for understanding offshore connections to the shoreline is presented along with the brief case studies of experience in Santa Barbara County, California, and offshore Louisiana."
