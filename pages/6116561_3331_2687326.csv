9,Abstract:,"Males recognize (suddenly attempt to grasp and to mate) newly molted (postmolt) parturial females upon contact of their chemotactile antennal flagella with any part of the female cuticle. Our objective was to determine if male sexual attraction to postmolt, prespawning parturial females is due to visual, chemical or textural cues."
