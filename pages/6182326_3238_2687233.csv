9,Abstract:,"For reasons that elude marine biologists, a handful of fish species in all the world's oceans tend to congregate beneath floating objects-be they mats of algae, logs, bobbing coconuts or plastic debris. Fishermen utilize this tendency by deploying special buoys known as fish aggregation devices, or FADs. By attracting fish to set areas, FADs greatly increase the efficiency of fishing operations. FADs are especially popular with the international tuna purse seine fleet in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, one of the world's major centers of tuna fishing. A downside of FAD-assisted fishing is that it leads to the harvest of many juvenile tunas that have not yet reproduced. This phenomenon has contributed to the depletion of bigeye tuna and could have implications for the spawning biomass of other tunas as well. FADassisted fishing has also increased incidental takes of sharks and endangered sea turtles."
