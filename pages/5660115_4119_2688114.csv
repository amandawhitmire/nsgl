11,Abstract:,"The bottom trawl fishery off the U.S. west coast is mixed-species fishery that harvests numerous species of flatfishes, rockfishes (""Sebastes"" spp.), and roundfishes. It is generally known that chinook salmon ""Oncorhynchus tshawytscha"" are incidentally captured by bottom trawls operating off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California. This paper describes the magnitude and distribution of chinook salmon catches by commercial bottom trawl vessels using data collected during the years 1985-1990."
