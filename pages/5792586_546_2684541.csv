11,Abstract:,"Reflecting the increasing concern worldwide about impacts of nonindigenous species, this year's conference expanded beyond the traditional focus on zebra mussels to include contributions in research and management of other aquatic nuisance species. California provided an ideal location for the first conference held west of the Rocky Mountains with many landscapes dominated by nonindigenous species. Most conspicuous among all the nonindigenous species in California are the 32 million people that are largely responsible for the dramatic alteration of native species and ecosystems, initially by intentional introductions of plants and animals for agriculture and landscaping, but more recently via unintentional introductions through a variety of vectors. This conference provided a good opportunity for resource managers, researchers, industry members and the public to exchange information and enhance our ability to effectively manage the resources and habitats we all utilize. Almost 140 papers or abstracts are grouped in major sections that cover nuisance species distributions, control products, ballast water as a vector, nuisance plant management, zebra mussels, ecosystem impacts, biological control, West Coast issues, strategic management coordination, public education, and other subjects."
