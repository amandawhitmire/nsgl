12,Abstract:,"Some spongivorous nudibranchs are able to concentrate nitrogenous metabolites from their prey. This investigation explored aminoimidazoles from the nudibranch, ""Notodoris gardineri"", and the sponge ""Leucetta"" sp. Five compounds were isolated and include known metabolites, clathridine and its corresponding Zn complex accompanied by new compounds, preclathridine A clathridine B , and Zn-​isonaamidine. The first four compounds were isolated from the nudibranch and the last was obtained from the sponge. The organometallic complex provides the second example of such a chemotype isolated from a sponge and this study reports the first instance of an organometallic compound isolated from a nudibranch."
