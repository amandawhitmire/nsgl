10,Abstract:,"The oceanographic survey problem is complicated by the fact that the ocean usually evolves on a time scale comparable to (or faster than) the survey time. The ideal survey would be accomplished instantaneously and with infinite resolution. However, as platform limitations preclude such synoptic surveys, compromises between resolution, total survey time, and vechicle speed must be made. This paper prosents a framework for optimizing uniform surveys of temporally evolving scalar fields under platform introduced constraints. Combining these constraints, a tool is developed which can be used to maximize survey efficiency and to assess relative efficiencies of various adaptive sampling techniques."
