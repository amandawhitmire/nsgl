10,Abstract:,"The Scott and Shasta rivers, Klamath River tributaries, experience spatialdisparit​y in habitat quality in spring and summer as a result of historical and current landuse.Juvenil​e Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) born in the upper tributary reachesoften rear in natal streams before migrating to sea. However, those born in the lowerreaches often encounter unsuitable habitat and emigrate during their first spring to seeknon-natal rearing habitats. It is assumed that these early outmigrants are populationlosse​s. This study evaluated first-summer survival, and contribution to the adultpopulation​, of non-natal rearing juveniles in the Klamath River Basin. In the spring of2014 and 2015 juveniles were tagged using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags asthey were leaving the lower Scott and Shasta Rivers. Movement and survival wassubsequently tracked using recapture and detection efforts in potential mainstem summerrearing locations. Strontium microchemistry from otolith samples of returning adultCoho Salmon throughout the basin was analyzed to estimate the contribution of non-​natalrearing juveniles to adult returns. Few tagged individuals were detected in non-​natalrearing habitats, but those detected in these habitats had survival rates comparable tonatal-rearing individuals. Otolith analysis indicated that the proportion of juvenile Coho Salmon rearing in non-natal habitats varied by spawning site. In total, 53% of the 116adults sampled reared in a natal location as juveniles, while 47% reared in a non-​natallocation. These results suggest that non-natal rearing can contribute to adult returns andcould be a significant population segment with increased restoration."
