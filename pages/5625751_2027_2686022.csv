12,Abstract:,"Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins and domoic acid are naturally occurring marine toxins. Single-called marine plants (phytoplankton) produce these toxins. Marine animals such as bivalves that filter their food from seawater may accumulate these toxins. The toxins do not appear to directly harm the animals, but people eating toxic seafoods may become poisoned. PSP toxins and domoic acid are powerful nerve poisons with no taste or odor. Cleaning seafoods in many cases will not remove the toxins, nor will cooking destroy them. This pamphlet lists precautions to be taken when gathering shellfish."
