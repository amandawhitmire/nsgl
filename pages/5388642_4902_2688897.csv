8,Abstract:,"Settlement and metamorphosis of marine invertebrate larvae are triggered, in many cases, by larval recognition of strictly required, substratum-​specific biochemical signals from the environment. In several species, these inducers are protein or peptide associated neurotransmitte​r-​mimetic molecules derived from amino acids. In the case of ""Haliotis"" (gastropod) larvae, GABA-mimetic inducers uniquely available at the surfaces of crustose red algae are detected by contact-​dependent chemosensory recognition, mediated by stereochemicall​y specific epithelial receptors. Larvae of oysters and certain other species are induced to settle and metamorphose in response to larval recognition of DOPA-mimetic inducers associated with their recruiting substrata. The properties of the inducing signal molecules, the larval chemosensory receptors, transducers and regulators that mediate and control larval settlement are discussed. The ecological and evolutionary significance of these findings is considered."
