11,Abstract:,"Exercise conditioning at 1.2-2.4 body lengths-s-1 for 60 d significantly improved final weights, specific growth rates (SGR), 2-min critical swimming velocities, red muscle cross- sectional areas at 80% standard length (SL), and red:white muscle ratio at 80% SL in both cultured and wild young-​of-​the-​year striped bass (""Morone saxatilis""). Wild fish had final weights and SGR greater than cultured fish in both exercised and unexercised groups. Exercise conditioning also increased white muscle cross-sectional areas at all sections (50, 65, and 80% SL) in the cultured but not in the wild fish, although white muscle areas of exercised wild fish were significantly greater than in the unexercised cultured fish. It is suggested that exercise- conditioned striped bass used for stocking purposes might show increased survival rates in the wild."
