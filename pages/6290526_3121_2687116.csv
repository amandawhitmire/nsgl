9,Abstract:,"The goal of this project was to address walnut growers' concerns that the restoration plan might exacerbate orchard pests in the riparian corridor. In particular, the Delta Science Fellow examined whether the return of native plants and animals increases farmers' problems with weeds, pest insects and pest birds. Based on the project's results, the answer is, no."
