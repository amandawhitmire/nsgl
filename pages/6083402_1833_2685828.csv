9,Abstract:,"Red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) live deep in the cracks and crevices in rocky reefs, and have probably retreated there because of predation pressure from sea otters, who like how they taste almost as much as humans do. Abalone are external fertilizers, releasing eggs and sperm into the water, which flows at speeds 2?3 times slower than the exposed sea above. But how do the sperm find eggs? Because the gametes are so small, they live in a microscopic world of viscous forces, dominated by laminar shear flow. This is where layers of fluid slide past each other and don't mix, and looks like 'stirring honey in a pot', says Jeff Riffell. With his colleague Richard Zimmer, Riffell investigated how shear, the linear change in water velocity with distance, affects sperm-egg interactions, and hence fertilization success"
