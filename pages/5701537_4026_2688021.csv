9,Abstract:,"Pathology is the consequence of prolonged stress. Stress can result in the development of a diverse number of pathologies that include not only disease, but the loss of reproduction, the failure to grow normally, and even the development of abnormal, deleterious behaviors. Fish in culture are especially at risk to the adverse effects of stress. Practical considerations have dictated most culture conditions with emphasis on such factors as the ease of cleaning, maximizing the number of fish, or using any holding facility that is readily available. Little concern is given to the fish, at least until stress becomes so severe that pathology occurs. Certainly this is an area of aquaculture that needs to be addressed, especially as increasingly intensified culture conditions are adopted."
