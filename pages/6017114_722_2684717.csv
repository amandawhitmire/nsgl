11,Abstract:,"The National Sea Grant College Program, a network of 30 university-​based programs, is dedicated to enhancing the understanding, conservation, and sustainable use of the nation’s coastal and marine resources. It has facilities and staff in every coastal and Great Lakes state, with activities funded principally by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Matching funds come from the individual states, and additional support from a variety of private sources. This Program Directory provides summaries of the projects being funded in 2006 by California Sea Grant."
