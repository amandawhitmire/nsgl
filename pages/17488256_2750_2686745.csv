7,Abstract:,"Rip currents are strong, jet-like, offshore-​directed flows that arise in the surf zone from complex interactions between waves, currents, water levels and bathymetry. While there has been some success in explaining rip currents that occur due to bathymetric variations, the cause of rip current formation and evolution in alongshore homogeneous bathymetric settings remains a mystery. Recent research, in areas such as Australia and California, has found a significant amount of horizontal eddy circulation within the rip current system. It is not clear how prevalent these eddy features are in surf zones along the east coast of the United States. The goal of this study is to gain insight on the controlling factors of rip current circulation on sandy beaches with limited alongshore bathymetric variation by fabricating and deploying rip current drifters. A linear regression of wave conditions on percent of drifters in circulation for each deployment showed that circulation increased when significant wave height increased, directional spread increased, and when the wave angle approached shore normal. Data from eight deployments using novel, low cost drifters will be compared to lifeguard observations of rip intensity to determine the efficacy of using drifter experiments as a proxy for lifeguard rip current intensity ratings. Overall, drifter data correlated well with what lifeguards were observing during the eight deployments providing confidence that lifeguard observational data is a useful tool when creating a rip current prediction algorithm later in Chapter II."
