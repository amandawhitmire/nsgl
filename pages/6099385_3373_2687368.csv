11,Abstract:,"Oregon is renowned not only for the natural beauty of its coastline but also for its enlightened tradition of publicly owned and protected beaches. Now revised and updated, the ""Oregon Coastal Access Guide"" offers a north-to-south tour of Oregon's Pacific edge, with extensive mile-by-mile coverage of scenic U.S. Highway 101. It provides a convenient and reliable reference on where to go, how to get there, and what to expect. The ""Access Guide"" is essential for anyone exploring the nearly four hundred miles of coastline that lie between the Columbia river and the California border. Kenn Oberrecht's detailed knowledge of the Oregon coast--he has driven thousands of miles on coastal roads and hiked hundreds of miles on beaches and trails--informs every page of this indispensable guide. ""A thorough and eminently useful guide...In fact, this book is closer to the ideal than any other on the subject."" -- The Statesman Journal"
