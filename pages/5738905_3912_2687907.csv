10,Abstract:,"The National Sea Grant College Program has taken its leadership, expertise, and infrastructure over the past several years to develop several national programs to combat scientific illiteracy, to encourage minority participation in the sciences, and to expand the pool of educated, scientifically trained individuals from which future leaders in research, government, business, and industry will be drawn. These two programs, the Global Environmental Change Training the Trainer Programs, and Operation Pathfinder: Oceanography and Coastal Processes for Middle School Teachers, are described within the context of the general educational challenge."
