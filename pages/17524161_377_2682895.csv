24,Abstract:,"Current climate trends resulting in rapid declines in sea ice and increasing water temperatures are likelyto expand the northern geographic range and duration of favorable conditions for harmful algal blooms(HABs), making algal toxins a growing concern in Alaskan marine food webs. Two of the most commonHAB toxins along the west coast of North America are the neurotoxins domoic acid (DA) and saxitoxin(STX). Over the last 20 years, DA toxicosis has caused significant illness and mortality in marinemammals along the west coast of the USA, but has not been reported to impact marine mammalsforaging in Alaskan waters. Saxitoxin, the most potent of the paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins, hasbeen well-documented in shellfish in the Aleutians and Gulf of Alaska for decades and associated withhuman illnesses and deaths due to consumption of toxic clams. There is little information regardingexposu​re of Alaskan marine mammals. Here, the spatial patterns and prevalence of DA and STX exposurein Alaskan marine mammals are documented in order to assess health risks to northern populationsincl​uding those species that are important to the nutritional, cultural, and economic well-being ofAlaskan coastal communities. In this study, 905 marine mammals from 13 species were sampledincludin​g; humpback whales, bowhead whales, beluga whales, harbor porpoises, northern fur seals,Steller sea lions, harbor seals, ringed seals, bearded seals, spotted seals, ribbon seals, Pacific walruses, and northern sea otters. Domoic acid was detected in all 13 species examined and had the greatestprevale​nce in bowhead whales (68%) and harbor seals (67%). Saxitoxin was detected in 10 of the13 species, with the highest prevalence in humpback whales (50%) and bowhead whales (32%). Pacificwalruses contained the highest concentrations of both STX and DA, with DA concentrations similar tothose detected in California sea lions exhibiting clinical signs of DA toxicosis (seizures) off the coast ofCentral California, USA. Forty-six individual marine mammals contained detectable concentrations ofboth toxins emphasizing the potential for combined exposure risks. Additionally, fetuses from a belugawhale, a harbor porpoise and a Steller sea lion contained detectable concentrations of DA documentingmate​rnal toxin transfer in these species. These results provide evidence that HAB toxins are presentthrougho​ut Alaska waters at levels high enough to be detected in marine mammals and have thepotential to impact marine mammal health in the Arctic marine environment."
