11,Abstract:,"Regional AdaptLA: Coastal Impacts Planning in the Los Angeles Region is a multi-year project to provide information on the potential impacts of sea level rise to local coastal jurisdictions. In the process, a community of practice on coastal planning is developing in the Los Angeles (L.A.) coastal region. Two science-based projects, developed by the TerraCosta Consulting Group (TCG) and Environmental Science Associates (ESA), modeled shoreline change, coastal erosion and coastal retreat under projected future climate scenarios for the Los Angeles County coast. The University of Southern California (USC) Sea Grant Program has developed this synthesis of the two Regional AdaptLA modeling projects for the benefit of the Regional AdaptLA coalition and stakeholder community. This Executive Summary provides background on the overall project, overviews of the methodologies used to conduct the scientific studies, a summary of major findings, and recommendations for how information provided in these studies can help inform local coastal adaptation planning efforts. This document provides a “bridge” between the technical work by ESA and TCG and the AdaptLA coalition. USC Sea Grant provides capacity building and technical assistance for local jurisdictions as well as coordination among stakeholders and critical government agencies."
