14,Abstract:,"Chemical investigation of the marine red alga ""Ceratodictyon spongiosum"" containing the symbiotic sponge ""Sigmadocia symbiotica"" collected from Biaro Island, Indonesia, yielded two isomers of a new and bioactive thiazole-​containing cyclic heptapeptide, ""cis,cis-"" and ""trans,trans""-​ceratospongamid​e. The peptides are stable conformational isomers of the two proline amide bonds. The ""trans,trans"" isomer exhibits potent inhibition of sPLA2 expression in a cell-based model for antiinflammatio​n, whereas the ""cis,cis"" isomer is inactive; ""trans,trans""- ceratospongamid​e was also shown to inhibit the expression of a human-sPLA2 promoter-based reporter by 90%."
