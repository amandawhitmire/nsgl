10,Abstract:,"Within the classes of vertebrates, dietary habits range from the omnivorous to the highly specialized. The authors explore how the nutrient absorptive characteristics of the vertebrate small intestine have adapted to these varied diets. The pattern of variation in intestinal transport rates among different vertebrates, and the mechanistic bases for variation, are considered; the effects of metabolic rate and dietary nutrient makeup on intestinal nutrient uptake, in particular, are examined. Basic parameters of sugar and amino acid uptake are compared in 19 species of vertebrates from every class."
