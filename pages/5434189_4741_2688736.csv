9,Abstract:,"The policy implementation literature has begun to focus on the question of how the perceptions and behavior of multiple implementation actors, located in different organizations and at different levels of government, mold the process and outcome of implementation. This article is concerned with questions of how different organizational levels communicate with each other, how much they know about each other's operations, how they perceive and interpret actions emanating from the other level, and the criteria or standards used by each level in making implementation decisions. These questions are explored in the context of the implementation of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976."
