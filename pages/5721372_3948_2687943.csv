15,Abstract:,"Thermodynamic stability constants have been estimated for the complexation of iron(III) with catecholate-â€‹type siderophores isolated from the marine bacterium ""Alteromonas luteoviolacea"" and from the marine cyanobacterium ""Synechococcus"" sp. Stability constants were determined utilizing the 'chelate scale' of Taylor et al. (1994). The scale is based upon a linear relationship between the reduction potentials and the pH-independent thermodynamic stability constants for known iron(III) complexes. The binding strengths of the iron(III) complexes examined in this study are quite high, suggesting that catecholate siderophores may play a role in the solubilization and biological uptake of iron in the marine environment."
