10,Abstract:,"Gill Na+,K+-ATPase is the branchial enzyme currently believed to be the driving force for salt extrusion in seawater adapted salmonids. The effect of ovine GH (oGH) ""in vivo"" and recombinant bovine insulin-like growth factor-I (rbIGF-I) ""in vitro"" on gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity was investigated in two seasonal experiments conducted during the parr-smolt transformation period of coho salmon. Both studies showed that rbIGF-I stimulates gill Na+,K+-ATPase directly; an ability that may depend on priming by endogenous or exogenous GH. This supports the role of IGF-I as an endocrine mediator for GH action during parr-smolt transformation."
