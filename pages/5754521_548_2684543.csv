8,Abstract:,"Zebra mussels were accidentally transported to Michigan in the ballast of a trans-Atlantic ship in the late 1980's. Since 1988, this invasive species has rapidly expanded its range throughout the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River and its tributaries, and some inland lakes. They can easily be spread further by trailoring of boats. This flyer explains how to guard against their spread."
