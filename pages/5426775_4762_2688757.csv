8,Abstract:,"Existence value is defined as the maximum willingness of society or its individuals to pay for environmental or species preservation or enhancement unattached to any anticipated use, even that of passive observation in person or through the media. It has been argued that there is no such value, or that such value is implicit in use-related valuations, and thus should not be counted twice. In this study, survey results of a random California population on their valuation of four marine mammal species clearly indicate the reality of existence value, and, in fact, show such value to dramatically exceed use valuations."
