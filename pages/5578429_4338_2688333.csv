11,Abstract:,"White sturgeon larvae fed artificial diets grow at a slower rate than do larvae fed live natural food. Providing live natural food, however, is impractical for reasons such as availability, cost, and storage, for even moderate-scale production. The primary objective of this study was to identify an adequate purified diet for white sturgeon larvae. This would allow us to examine specific aspects of larval nutrition, including nutrient requirements and palatability of feed, and would thereby lead to the formulation of an artificial diet producing optimal growth and survival. A second objective was to determine the effect of lower water temperature on survival of white sturgeon larvae."
