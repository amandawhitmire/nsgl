12,Abstract:,"This symposium brought together participants from private organizations, government, academia, and citizen groups to exchange information and ideas on the future of ferry transportation in the San Francisco area. The meeting was designed to explore future prospects for increased Bay Area ferry transportation and identify any impediments to ferries achieving their full service potential. The symposium agenda dealt with ferries for both passengers and freight, and with the role of ferries in providing mobility during emergencies. A meeting objective was to provide as much information as possible to participants so that the future debate on ferry transportation would be driven by physical, economic, and market realities."
