10,Abstract:,"Vanadium bromoperoxidase (V-BrPO) has been isolated and purified from the marine brown algae ""Fucus distichus"" and ""Macrocystis pyrifera."" V-BrPO catalyzes the oxidation of bromide by hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the bromination of certain organic acceptors or the formation of dioxygen. V-BrPO also catalyzes the oxidation of bromide using peracetic acid. In contrast to hydrogen peroxide, V-BrPO does not catalyze formation of dioxygen from peracetic acid in either the presence or absence of bromide. V-BrPO also uses phenylperacetic acid, ""m""-​chloroperoxyben​zoic acid, and ""p""-​nitroperoxybenz​oic acid to catalyze the oxidation of bromide; dioxygen is not formed. V-BrPO does not catalyze bromide oxidation or dioxygen formation with the alkyl peroxides ethyl hydroperoxide, ""tert""-butyl hydroperoxide, and cuminyl hydroperoxide."
