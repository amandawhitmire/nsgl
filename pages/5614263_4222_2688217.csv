10,Abstract:,"Recently, the sesquiterpenoid hormone, methyl farnesoate (MF), has been implicated in crustacean reproduction and development. MF is synthesized by the mandibular organ (MO) and secreted into the hemolymph. This study demonstrates that MOs of the crab, ""Cancer magister"", secrete MF in-vitro, and presents evidence for a regulatory role of MF on ecdysteroid secretion by the Y-organ."
