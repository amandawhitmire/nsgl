12,Abstract:,"Collagen is the main protein of connective tissues. Muscle from bony fishes contains a relatively low concentration of collagen; however, change in collagen has been implicated in quality deterioration and loss of yield in a number of seafood processing operations. This study employed an immunological Western blotting method for detecting collagen and peptides derived from collagen in muscle tissue. Application of this technique to rockfish muscle stored at 0 deg.rees C did not reveal degradation products of collagen. However, short term storage of sterile rockfish fillets at 30 deg. C revealed that endogenous collagenolytic activity results in rapid and complete disappearance of muscle collagen."
