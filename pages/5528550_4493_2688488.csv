13,Abstract:,"Active management of the Alaskan red king crab fishery requires regular surveys yielding information on productivity and recruitment. Inclusion of egg mortality information can be readily accomplished and will enhance interpretation of reduced percent clutch observations. Specific and simple sampling procedures are proposed here to estimate egg mortality, intensity of nemertean infestations and other infectious diseases of the eggs. Such samples would enhance retrospective studies of crab fecundity, brooding seasonality, and the systematics and abundance of clutch symbionts; a routine pleopod sampling program would provide a basis to assess the frequency and causes of future reproductive events. Nemertean infestation can be widespread and intense, at times consuming nearly all crab eggs."
