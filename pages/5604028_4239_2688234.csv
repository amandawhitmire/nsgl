13,Abstract:,"""Scirpus californicus"" (giant bulrush) wetland mesocosms were subjected to four hydroperiods (pulsed-​discharge regimes). The most frequently pulsed treatment (twice per day) was the most efficient at removing metals from synthetic wastewater, attributed to the formation of iron oxyhydroxide-​metal complexes. The continuously flooded treatment had slightly lower removal rates. After a year of metal additions, mean removal efficiencies were 75-78% for cadmium, chromium, and zinc, 84% for lead, and 55% for nickel. Most of the metals were retained in the soil. Indications are that wetland treatment, especially with hydroperiod manipulations, can reduce metal concentrations in wastewater and, therefore, in downstream ecosystems."
