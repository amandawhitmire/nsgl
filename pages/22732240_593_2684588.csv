12,Abstract:,"The Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, is the focus of many restoration projects along estuaries in the North American Pacific coast, whereas the non-indigenous Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, makes up the vast majority of oyster aquaculture in the region. Both O. lurida habitat and C. gigas aquaculture provide filtration functions as filter feeders, my project investigated the contributions of both in three California bays using a whole- habitat, in situ approach. I collected upstream-‚Äãdownstream measurements of chlorophyll ùõº, temperature, salinity, and turbidity to estimate habitat clearance rates (HCR, L hr-1m-2). In parallel, I estimated seston total particulate matter (TPM), and organic content (OC), and examined existing data on bivalve density and biomass. Twenty-two experimental trials and four control mudflat trials were conducted from February 2018 to June 2019. Mean HCR at O. lurida restoration sites were 166 L hr-1 m-2 (SD = 255) at San Rafael, -464 L hr-1 m-2 (SD = 1420) at Shellmaker, and 105 L hr-1 m-2 (SD = 251) at Deanza, while the C. gigas aquaculture site at Morro Bay was 10.3 L hr-1 m-2 (SD = 257). HCRs were highly variable within and among sites, and not significantly different. Using random forest regression analysis, I found that temperature (30.6%) was relatively most important to HCR, followed by turbidity (27.9%), TPM (12%), OC (10.8%), site (10.6%), and salinity (8.1%). The contributions of all bivalve filter feeders and natural hydrodynamics are inherently included in whole-habitat in situ measurements in this study. My research indicates that the field filtration performance of O. lurida habitat and C. gigas aquaculture are similar in California bays."
