13,Abstract:,"To understand the transport and uptake of watershed-​derived anthropogenic lead (Pb) by the reef community and bay water, Pb isotopes were measured on juvenile reef fish otoliths, reef coral, and bay water samples in a transect across Kaneohe Bay, Oahu. Nearly identical Pb isotopic trends, defined by high and low 206Pb/204Pb end-members, were observed in otoliths and in filtered, acidified water samples. Pb isotopic compositions of particulate matter discharged from an urban stream has a low 206Pb/204Pb signature reflecting the anthropogenic signature of the watershed. Ocean water has a high 206Pb/204Pb isotopic composition, probably reflecting Pb derived from long-range anthropogenic aerosols and to some extent, natural eolian dusts. Pb concentrations in H2O2 treated P. lobata aragonite closely predicted dissolved bay water concentrations according to Shen and Boyle's (1987) Kd. However, the coral samples had a very small range in isotopic composition very similar to urban watershed Pb and distinct from that measured on water samples collected nearby. While the Pb in fish otoliths appears to be in isotopic equilibrium with the dissolved load, Pb in the coral may be incorporated directly from watershed particulate matter flushed into the bay. The relationship between dissolved and particle-bound metal concentrations and those in coral aragonite may be complex in nearshore conditions where the transport of even minor amounts of sedimentary material into the coastal zone takes place."
