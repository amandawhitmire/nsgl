9,Abstract:,"The ""Fisheries in a Changing Climate Symposium"" was held at the American Fisheries Society 2001 Annual Meeting. This symposium proceedings volume represents the culmination of a multi-agency effort, organized by AFS, Sea Grant, and others, to bring together scientists from U.S. and Canadian governmental agencies and universities to discuss fisheries and climate change. These scientists, faced with the release of the third global climate change assessment by the Intergovernment​al Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the continued debate over the Kyoto Protocol, presented useful reviews and exciting new research on the past, present, and future impacts of climate change and variability on commercial, recreational, marine, and freshwater fisheries. The papers in the proceedings cover a wide geographical area from oceanic fisheries in the northwest Atlantic and northeast Pacific to inland fisheries in the Great Lakes and western U.S. rivers and streams. In addition to fisheries science research, some chapters detail the impacts of climate change on aquatic ecosystems and fisheries policy and management. This comprehensive volume will be a valuable resource for anyone with an interest in the topic and will serve as a guide to those continuing to research the future of fisheries in a changing climate."
