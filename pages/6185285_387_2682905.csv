8,Abstract:,"Small craft are implicated in transporting aquatic invasive species (AIS) from ports to smaller harbors along the coast. For example, AIS from San Francisco Bay are found in Elkhorn Slough, which drains into Monterey Bay. Small craft, such as commercial fishing and pleasure boats, are likely to have brought them from San Francisco Bay where commercial ships dock (Wasson et al. 2001). Recreational boating is characterized by races, fishing tournaments and coastal cruising that convene boats from many areas at locations far from home ports. Approximately 80% of boats in Baja California marinas are from the United States, primarily California and Arizona according to Fonatur (Mexico's Federal Tourism Promotion Fund). Mexico's streamlined customs clearance policy (Puerto de Ensenada 2005) and planned expansion of Baja California marina capacity (Escalera Nautica 2005) will increase binational boat traffic and AIS transport risks. Our literature review found that cruising, races and fishing draw many California boaters along the coast and across the border (Conlon 2002). This increases risks that boats will exchange and carry AIS to new locations."
