10,Abstract:,"In aquatic arthropods, shedding of the exuvium at ecdysis is accompanied by a sudden increase in wet weight due to rapid water uptake. Urinary rates were studied in cannulated juvenile lobsters. At ecdysis, urinary flow ceased when drinking rate increased, suggesting that the intermolt mechanism regulating body volume may have been altered. In 100% SW, drinking was necessary for lobsters to gain sufficient water to withdraw their claws at ecdysis. While in 75% SW, osmotic entry of water across the body surface alone was sufficient to permit a successful molt. These results indicate that water influx across the body surface may contribute to much of the water intake at ecdysis if the osmotic gradient is substantial and that the cessation of urinary flow contributes to the overall water balance at ecdysis."
