10,Abstract:,"Commercial use of modified atmospheres (MA) to extend the shelflife of fishery products has been limited by the potential of ""Clostridium botulinum"" growth and toxin production in refrigerated, MA-packed fish, without overt sensory evidence of spoilage. Qualitative studies to assess the risk from ""C. botulinum"" toxigenesis in a variety of MA-packaged fish stored at low and abusive temperatures have been conducted and studies to quantify the safe storage limits have been reported. The statistical analyses and conclusions of all previously reported data are discussed here. While probability was determined in many experiments, only lag time is considered here, since it is the most conservative quantitative estimate of the risk of ""C. botulinum"" growth and toxigenesis. A mathematical model for lag time prediction agrees well with toxicity data reported and allows comparison of results presented in the reported studies."
