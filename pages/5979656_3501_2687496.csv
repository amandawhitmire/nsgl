13,Abstract:,"The objectives of this study were (1) to estimate age from otolith growth zone counts, (2) to describe growth, and (3) to validate the annual periodicity of growth zones used to estimate longevity for the blackgill rockfish ""Sebastes melanostomus"" with the radiometric aging technique. An ancillary objective was to create a reliable predictive relationship between average otolith weight and estimated age for use as a timesaving tool in the management of this species. Growth zones quantified in sectioned otoliths were used to estimate age, and growth was described by using the von Bertalanffy growth function. Final age estimates were directly compared to radiometric ages to evaluate agreement between the two methods and ultimately were used to validate age estimation procedures, age-​at-​maturity, and longevity for this species."
