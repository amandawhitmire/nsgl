10,,"Population expansion, more disposable income, and increases in leisure time and personal mobility have fueled phenomenal growth in the demand for coastal recreation. Recreation is not only a large and rapidly expanding national industry, but also one of the fastest growing uses of California's coastline; the California coast is the state's most important recreational resource. Businesses and services catering to the recreational leisure-time activities that typify the California lifestyle are important to the state's economy; recreation is a multibillion dollar industry. Despite its central role, however, recreation must also compete with other important claims on the coast, e.g., maritime uses, energy development, environmental protection, and urbanization. This book describes the recreational uses and users of California's coast, and reviews the range of interest conflicts and other problems involved in administering this superb but vulnerable resource. Principal public- and private-sector activities affecting the coast are discussed, along with the various views and interpretations of coastal issues and ways of resolving them."
