9,Abstract:,"California's boating industry contributes $16 billion per year to the state's economy (CSU, Sacramento Foundation 2002). Impacts from invasive species introductions and from toxic antifouling bottom paints continue to affect California's ecosystem. The University of California Cooperative Extension- Sea Grant Extension Program in San Diego has been working on cost-effective programs for boaters to prevent hull transport of aquatic invasive species (AIS) and to protect water quality by reducing the use of toxic antifoulants."
