10,Abstract:,"This book chapter begins with a comparison of the problems associated with the eradication of introduced marine versus terrestrial and freshwater pests. The author then describes two recent apparently successful efforts to eradicate well- established marine pests--the sabellid worm pest of abalone in California and the brackish water black-striped mussel in Cullen Bay, Northern Territory, Australia. The two histories are analyzed for factors that promoted successful eradication."
