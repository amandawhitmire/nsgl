11,Abstract:,"""Spartina"" (cordgrass) salt marshes are widespread throughout the Americas and northern Europe. On the pacific coast of the USA, ""Spartina foliosa"" marshes are less extensive, and anthropogenic influence has led to substantial reduction in ""S. foliosa"" salt marsh area. While these marshes support juveniles of several commercially important species, they are valued primarily as habitat for rare and endangered plant and animal species."
