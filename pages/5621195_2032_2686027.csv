10,Abstract:,"In order to gain a more comprehensive knowledge of the metabolic capabilities of zooplankton, other than crustaceans, from the deep sea, studies were undertaken on two abundant deep-sea pelagic worms, ""Nectonemertes mirabilis"" and ""Poeobius meseres"". Metabolic potentials of these worms were estimated by measuring the activities of several key enzymes involved in aerobic and anaerobic metabolism and investigating the correlation of these activities with oxygen consumption rates. Analyses of water, protein, lipid, carbohydrate, carbon and nitrogen, followed by calculations of energy contents, were also undertaken. Studies on the biochemistry and physiology of these animals will help us to understand how their energy is stored and utilized, and possibly shed light on their ecological relationships."
