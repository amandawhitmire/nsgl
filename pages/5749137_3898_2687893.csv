11,Abstract:,"The privatization idea-​-​especially with regard to introduction of the Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) as a form of property ownership--has spread rapidly as an alternative to free access in the fisheries policy of many countries. In light of this intensified interest the authors review the 'pre-history' of the current-day debate and inquire how today's debates of theory and policy have taken form in light of earlier experience. The many dimensions of the history make it a complex one, thus the focus of the present analysis is confined to the history of the debate of theory and policy in the United States and Canada."
