14,Abstract:,"These CD-ROMs contain the final report on the Marine Ecological Reserves Research Program, a synthesis of all research results for the period 1996 through 2001. The goal of this peer-reviewed research program was to steer the development of grant proposals into a cohesive program addressing the concept of marine reserves and providing solid baseline studies of four new reserves in California. The studies address such topics as quantitative inventory; marine reserves as a management tool; population genetics; and a variety of case studies at the reserves."
