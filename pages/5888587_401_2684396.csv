10,Abstract:,"The 12 essays in this volume provide analysis of a broad range of important issues relating to legal principle, substantive policy, procedural mandates, and institutional innovation that have been prominent in ocean affairs since the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention. Each of the authors takes into account, in framing analysis of specific questions, the perspective of the historic principles of the ocean law tradition; and seeks, as relevant, to indicate how political movements, institutional changes, and new formal agreements, such as the Convention on Biodiversity, the marine pollution conventions, or the Fishery Stocks Agreement, have interacted with efforts to implement the Law of the Sea Convention and its mandates."
