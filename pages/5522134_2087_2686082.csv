13,Abstract:,"Studies of protein and morphological variation were made in the Pacific sardine to determine the role that population structure played in the collapse of the fishery and its recent resurgence. Pacific sardines from five widely separated localities are found to have little genetic variation both within and between populations. These results contrast with the substantial genetic variation detected within and between northern anchovy populations, and imply that rapid differentiation of growth rates among geographic populations and differentiation of correlated life history traits are largely environmentallyâ€‹, rather than genetically, determined. It appears that biological data from historical populations can safely be used for area-specific fisheries models of the recovering sardine stocks in California."
