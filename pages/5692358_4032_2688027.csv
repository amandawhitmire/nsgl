12,Abstract:,"Although transport and nearshore oceanographic conditions have been a focus of settlement investigations since the early days of larval ecology, many questions remain regarding physical oceanographic influences on the transport and settlement of marine invertebrate larvae in the coastal ocean. The specific transport mechanisms underlying successful settlement have been identified for only a few species. This study relates observed intra-annual patterns of settlement of sea urchin and crab larvae to coastal circulation inferred from local oceanographic observations."
