8,Abstract:,"With the development of offshore engineering in recent years, the need for an improved understanding of the effects of hydrodynamic forces on offshore structures becomes increasingly evident. The problem of a single vertical cylinder subjected to the hydrodynamic forces produced by surface waves, earthquake motions and currents is reasonably well understood; however, the hydrodynamic interaction of multiple flexible structures under these conditions is not so well understood. Since most often offshore platforms have three or four cylindrical legs and frequently support clusters of parallel riser pipes, this interaction was selected as the topic of investigation. Hydrodynamic interaction is shown to be relevant if the structures are in close proximity. This phenomenon depends on the characteristics of structures, water depth, distance between structures, excitation frequency, amplitude of ground motion, and the direction of excitation."
