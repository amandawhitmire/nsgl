13,Abstract:,"Phytoplankton blooms, including toxic species such as the diatom genus Pseudo-​nitzschia or the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum, are a characteristic phenomenon in coastal and upwelling regions of the world's oceans. Blooms of harmful algal species have deleterious effects on marine ecosystems, and their impact on public health and local economies can be large and has been increasing globally.1 This increasing incidence has sparked interest in species of bacteria closely associated (or symbiotic) with toxic dinoflagellates​. Thus, axenic (bacteria-free) dinoflagellate cultures often cannot be established, and even when they can, they require the addition of vitamins and artificial metal complexes for satisfactory viability.2 It can be inferred that under natural conditions, these heterotrophic bacteria contribute some critical factor(s) to the nutrition of the relevant marine algae. A broad hypothesis that links these bacterial ""symbionts"" to the growth of toxic dinoflagellates is in their control of the supply of iron since this element, while the fourth most abundant in the Earth's crust, is present under aerobic conditions at neutral pH only in the form of extremely insoluble minerals that severely restrict its bioavailability​. The iron level in open ocean waters is even lower than in most terrestrial environments.3,​4 While the iron uptake systems of phytoplankton are largely unknown, bacteria on the other hand have evolved sophisticated systems based on high-affinity iron specific binding compounds called siderophores to acquire, transport, and process this essential metal ion. Several hundred siderophores, whose biosyntheses are repressed by high iron levels, are known, and extensive studies of their isolation, structure, transport, and molecular genetics have been undertaken in the last two decades.5 The structural variety of siderophores, both terrestrial and marine, has been comprehensively reviewed.6 Considered essential to their role as iron transporters is the fact that siderophores have both high affinity and high specificity for Fe(III) over other biologically significant cations."
