10,Abstract:,"Scientists tracked sooty shearwaters (Puffinus griseus) within the California Current ecosystem during their summertime feeding period and used the data to locate aggregations of prey species such as anchovy, sardine, krill and squid. Findings are assisting in identifying critical at-sea habitats for the shearwaters and are of direct relevance to developing ecosystem-based management plans of forage species, upon which seabirds and other marine species rely"
