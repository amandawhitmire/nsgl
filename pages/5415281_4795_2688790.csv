11,Abstract:,"Studies on thyroid ultrastructure of salmon whose growth is stunted following premature entry into seawater suggest that thyroid hypoactivity may be a principal cause of this developmental defect. In general, these observations suggest a close association of thyroid function with normal and abnormal development in young salmon. Blood and tissue containing thyroid follicles were collected from control and TSH-injected fish in January (presmolts) and March (smolts) for T4 radioimmunoassa​y and for the evaluation of changes in throid gland morphology; results are discussed."
