13,Abstract:,"The status of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mRNA in the liver and gill of coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") during the parr-smolt transformation (smoltificationâ€‹) was examined in relation to changes in plasma levels of thyroxine, cortisol, growth hormone and somatolactin. The results suggest specific roles for IGF-I expression in liver and gill during salmonid smoltification, and the possible involvement of signals other than GH in regulation of IGF-I gene expression."
