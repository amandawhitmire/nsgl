9,Abstract:,"Ships in the vicinity of offshore or coastal structures present a hazard; collision may have dire consequences in terms of human life, environmental impact and costs due to repair and downtime. Design to minimize accidental damage due to collision should accommodate extreme situations in a variety of scenarios including ship berthing, collision with offshore platforms, or the flooding of dry docks with an enclosed hull. This research has been in part motivated by the recent breakthroughs in the numerical simulation of free-surface flows. Building on the first-order approach, results accounting for some of the nonlinearities in the definition of the physical problem may be obtained. The emphasis is placed on being able to model, within the framework of nonlinear potential theory, the sideways transient motion which is characteristic of a berthing ship or a supply vessel drifting into a platform."
