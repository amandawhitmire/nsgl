10,Abstract:,"Current methods to estimate fish stock size from pelagic fish egg abundance by using ships to take point samples of fish eggs have large margins of error due to spatial and temporal undersampling. The real-time flow imaging and classification (REFLICS) enhances fish egg sampling by obtaining continuous, accurate information on fish egg abundance as the ship cruises along in the area of interest. REFLICS images the dynamic flow with a progressive-â€‹scan area camera (60 frames/s) and a synchronized strobe in backlighting configuration. REFLICS uses a segmentation algorithm to locate fish-egg-like objects in the image and then a classifier to determine fish egg, species, and age. The authors of this paper present an integrated system design of REFLICS and performance results."
