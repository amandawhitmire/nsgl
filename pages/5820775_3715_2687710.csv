10,Abstract:,"In many southern California salt marshes, increased freshwater inflows have promoted the establishment of exotic plant species. A comparative study showed that a native, perennial, high marsh dominant, and an invasive, exotic annual grass, responded differently to soil salinity and saturation. A field experiment verified that salt application was sufficient to control the exotic, while not noticeably affecting the native. Thus, salt applications may be a practical method for controlling invasions in areas receiving urban runoff or other unwanted freshwater inflows."
