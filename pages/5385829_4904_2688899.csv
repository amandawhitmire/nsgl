10,Abstract:,"A procedure for the long-term storage of lobster (""Homarus"") sperm involves collection by electrically stimulating the area around the gonopore; spermatophores are transferred to a plastic test tube containing paraffin oil and stored at 4-7 deg C. Sperm stored up to 289 days appear morphologically normal; after longer periods of storage, degenerative changes begin to develop. Sperm stored better in spermatophores that had thick walls than in those with thin walls. This technique provides a means for saving lobster sperm for subsequent use in experiments or for artificial insemination of female lobsters. It may be adaptable to other invertebrate species that produce spermatophores."
