8,Abstract:,"Juvenile hormones (JH) are unique sesquiterpene derivatives that regulate a number of developmental functions in insects. JH may modulate differential gene expression in a manner similar to that proposed for steroid hormones; namely, that the hormone passively diffuses into cells and then is complexed with a cellular JH binding protein (CJHBP). Data indicative of a cytosolic location of a CJHBP have been obtained from ""Drosophila hydei"" epidermis. This laboratory concentrated on the Kc cell line of ""Drosophila melanogaster""; this cell line offers several advantages to the use of tissues obtained from whole insects. Research on the mode of action of JH is reported here."
