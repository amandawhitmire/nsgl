18,Notes:,"California Coastal Commission Regional Cumulative Assessment Project September, 1995"
19,Abstract:,"Because of growing concern over the ability of state coastal management programs to address the impacts of cumulative growth and development, the U.S. Congress identified cumulative impacts as a priority area for improving coastal management programs nation-wide. Section 309 of the 1990 Amendments to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) provides funding and oversight to guide this effort. In response to the 1990 Amendments, the Coastal Commission completed an Assessment of the California Coastal Management Program and in March, 1992, adopted a multi-year strategy to implement program improvements in several issue areas: Cumulative and Secondary Impacts, Wetlands, Coastal Hazards, and Public Access. The Coastal Commission's Regional Cumulat Assessment Project (ReCAP), undertaken as a pilot project in the Monterey Bay region, comprises the core of this strategy. Under ReCAP, the Commission staff assessed the cumulative impacts of development on wetlands, coastal hazards, and public access in the pilot region and developed program and policy recommendations to improve management of such impacts. The ReCAP pilot region is defined as the coastal zone extending from the Santa Cruz/San Mateo county line through Point Lobos State Park in Monterey County. Cumulative impacts are addressed and coastal resources managed primarily through three major processes under the California Coastal Management Program (CCMP): coastal development permitting and appeals, planning and implementation of local coastal plans (LCP and federal consistency review. However, the existing management framework makes effective management of cumulative impacts difficult. In the pilot region, seven local jurisdictions have certified LCPs and therefore issue most coastal permits, with the Commission retaining only limited permit and appeal authority. These jurisdictions are: Santa Cruz County, Santa Cruz City, Capitola, Watsonville, Monterey County, the City of Marina, and Sand City. The Commission approved amendments to these LCPs at least 58 times, many of which were project related. Four jurisdictions have yet to be certified and the Commission retains jurisdiction in these areas (the Cities of Pacific Grove, Seaside, Carmel-​by-​the-​Sea, and Monterey). In addition to the CCMP, other state and federal agencies have regulatory authority affecting coastal resources under separate laws. Therefore, under the existing framework, multiple jurisdictions have varying policies and standards in different geographic areas."
