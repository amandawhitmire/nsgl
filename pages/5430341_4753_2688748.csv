10,Abstract:,"To separate the contributions of phenotypic responses and genetically fixed adaptations, the authors compared intestinal absorption of D-glucose and the amino acid L-proline in eight fish species, of which three are herbivores (carp, grass carp, tilapia), two are omnivores (channel catfish, white sturgeon), two are carnivores (striped bass, rainbow trout), and one switches from carnivory to herbivory as it grows (""Cebidichthys violaceus"", the monkeyface prickleback). All eight species were maintained in the laboratory on the same manufactured diet, thereby eliminating a possible contribution of phenotypic responses to observed species differences."
