10,Abstract:,"Alkaloids based on a 2-​amino-​3-​hydroxyoctadeca​ne moiety, sometimes referred to as lysine-derived metabolites, have been found in several genera of ascidians. Here researchers describe the isolation from ""Aplidium uouo"" and structural elucidation of two monocyclic piperidine alkaloids, uoamines A and B."
