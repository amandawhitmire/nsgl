9,Abstract:,"The 1992 Paul Hall Lecture, presented by Andrew E. Gibson, Professor, Emory S. Land Chair of Maritime Affairs, U.S. Naval War College, in Washington D. C., concerns the future of the American merchant marine in the aftermath of the war in the Persian Gulf. He discusses the role of the merchant marine fleet during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and its potential contribution to U.S. forces in the future. Fearing a demise of the merchant marine fleet if support by the U.S. government is not forthcoming, Professor Gibson offers suggestions for legislative reform of shipping subsidies and taxes and echoes Paul Hall's challenge to the government to support a meaningful maritime program."
