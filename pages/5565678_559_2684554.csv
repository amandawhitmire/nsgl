9,Abstract:,"This article deals with an aspect of adaptation to climate change: the effect of a rising sea level on the law of baselines. This aspect of the law of the sea rests upon the assumption that there will not be a significant rise in sea level. In particular, the international legal order provides that the outer boundary of maritime zones, such as the 12-mile territorial sea or the 200- mile exclusive economic zone, is measured from a baseline, normally the low water mark. Moreover, these boundaries are to advance or recede in step with the baselines from which they are drawn. States confronted with possible recession will respond in inefficient ways; the rule will lead to uncertainty in the position of maritime boundaries and, hence, increase the likelihood of interstate and private transnational conflict. The author proposes that that aspect of the law of baselines which provides for the adjustment of boundaries to match shifts in baselines should be replaced by a system in which the boundaries of all maritime zones, in particular the exclusive economic zone, are fixed on the basis of presently accepted baselines. The arguments for and against such a proposal are discussed, along with the difficulties involved in implementing it and the possible consequences of inaction."
