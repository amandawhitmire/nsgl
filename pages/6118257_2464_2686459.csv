11,Abstract:,"A single individual of a new goby species in the genus Vanderhorstia was collected from a fine sand bottom at Vanua Balavu Island, Bay of Islands, in the Northern Lau Group of Fiji. The species differs from all other described species in the genus except V. mertensi by having 17 dorsal and 18 anal-fin rays. It differs from V. mertensi by having about 77 versus 52-62 longitudinal scales and lacking a row of black spots the length of its midside. Vanderhorstia bella has much lavender coloration on the head and body and many bright yellow spots. While conducting a survey of the fishes of Fiji, we collected a single individual of a spectacularly colored new goby in the genus Vanderhorstia. The specimen was collected using rotenone from a fine, silty, sand bottom at a depth of 8.3 m at Vanua Balavu Island, Bay of Islands, in the Northern Lau Group of Fiji. The genus Vanderhorstia is represented by 12 described species, which are considered to be valid (Winterbottom et al. 2005)."
