7,Abstract:,"The author visited Japan for five weeks in March and April, 1987, under the auspices of the Scientist Exchange Program of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Program in Natural Resources. The purposes of this trip were to learn about Japan's (1) aquaculture, with an emphasis on salmonid and cold-water molluscan species; (2) coastal fisheries, organization of fishermen's cooperatives, and methods of marketing seafood products; (3) fisheries and aquaculture extension activities; and (4) fisheries education and training programs. Three reports grew out of this opportunity and are organized under the following titles: Report of Study Trip to Japan, March-April, 1987: I. Molluscan Aquaculture and Fisheries (CUIMR-​T-​87-​002); II. Salmonid Aquaculture and Fisheries (CUIMR-​T-​87-​003); and III. Fisheries Education and Extension Activities (CUIMR-​T-​87-​004). Following the text of each section, a list of relevant publications collected in Japan are listed. Copies of these are available at cost from the author."
