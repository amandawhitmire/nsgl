9,Abstract:,"The Paul Hall Memorial Endowment promotes marine transportation programs; the Memorial Lecture Program was developed in 1987 to honor distinguished contributors to marine transportation and maritime industries. This 1991 lecture was delivered by Clinton H. Whitehurst, Jr., Professor Emeritus and Senior Fellow at the Strom Thurmond Institute of Government and Public Affairs, Clemson Unviersity, at a symposium on Coastal Ocean Space Utilization in Long Beach, California. He discusses the present day-to-day conditions under which the maritime industry operates, its history, and the problems the maritime transportation industry faces in the U.S. The benefits to the country of a privately owned and operated U.S. flag merchant marine are described, as are ways for strengthening its operation for the future."
