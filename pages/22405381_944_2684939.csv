15,Abstract:,"The 2012–2015 drought in north-central coastal California ranks among the three most prolonged periods of below-median annual rainfall in the past 65 years. In three critical coho salmon streams, summer base flow was less each additional dry year; streams with summer flow early in the drought had no flow for more than two months in latter years. By the third dry year, summer discharge was 1–5% of recent wet-type years, and 10–20% of the first dry year. Multiannual drought also caused increased dry channel conditions: the percentage of flowing channel reduced from 28 to 55% from the first to the third dry years among three study streams. In the first year following drought, dry-season streamflow resembled early to-mid-drought conditions, while in the second, it approached pre-drought discharge. This multiannual drought foreshadows how multi-annual drought predicted under future climate scenarios may affect critical salmonid streams later this century."
