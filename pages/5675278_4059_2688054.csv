10,Abstract:,"The population of striped bass (""Morone saxatilis"") in the Sacramento--San Joaquin estuary has declined rapidly since 1974, resulting in mitigative stocking of young-​of-​the-​year (YOY) fish. The fact that the stocked fish were not conditioned is probably one of the reasons why the striped bass population continues to decline at an alarming rate. The main objective of this study was to ascertain the optimum exercise conditioning velocity for growth, muscular development, swimming performance and persistence of these effects in YOY striped bass."
