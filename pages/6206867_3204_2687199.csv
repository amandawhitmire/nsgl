15,Abstract:,"Marine microalgae support world fisheries production and influence climate through a variety of mechanisms. They are also responsible for harmful blooms that adversely impact coastal ecosystems and economies. Optimal growth and survival of many bloom-forming microalgae, including climatically important dinoflagellates and coccolithophore​s, requires the close association of specific bacterial species, but the reasons for these associations are unknown. Here we report that several clades of Marinobacter ubiquitously found in close association with dinoflagellates and coccolithophore​s produce an unusual, lower affinity dicitrate siderophore, vibrioferrin (VF). Fe-VF chelates undergo photolysis at rates that are 10-20 times higher than siderophores produced by free living marine bacteria, and unlike the latter, the VF photoproduct has no measurable affinity for iron. While both an algal-​associated bacterium and a representative dinoflagellate partner, Scrippsiella trochoidea, utilized iron from Fe-VF chelates in the dark, in situ photolysis of the chelates in the presence of attenuated sunlight increased bacterial iron uptake by 70% and algal uptake by over 20-fold. These results suggest that the bacteria promote algal assimilation of iron by facilitating photochemical redox cycling of this critical nutrient. In addition, binary culture experiments and genomic evidence suggests that the algal cells release organic molecules that are utilized by the bacteria for growth. Such mutualistic sharing of iron and fixed carbon has important implications toward our understanding of the close beneficial interactions between marine bacteria and phytoplankton, and the effect of these interactions on algal blooms and climate."
