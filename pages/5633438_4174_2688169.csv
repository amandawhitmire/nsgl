10,Abstract:,"Chaetognaths are invertebrate predators which usually comprise the second largest fraction of zooplankton biomass in the oceans following copepods. At greater depths they sometimes constitute the dominant fraction of zooplankton biomass. Although these animals are important members of pelagic communities, very little is known of their metabolic capabilities. In this study, metabolic potentials of chaetognaths were estimated by measuring the activities of two key enzymes involved in aerobic and anaerobic metabolism (citrate synthase and pyruvate kinase) and correlating these activities with oxygen consumption rates measured on the same individuals. Metabolic rates and potentials were examined with regard to body size and minimum depths of occurrence of the species investigated."
