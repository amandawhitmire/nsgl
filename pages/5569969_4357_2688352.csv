11,Abstract:,"Peptide hormones in vertebrates have been covalently linked to their receptor proteins at target sites using heterobifunctio​nal crosslinkers and by photoaffinity labeling; however, no analogous experiments appear to have been performed in invertebrates. As reported here, two photoaffinity analogs of the crustacean erythrophore (red pigment) concentrating hormone (RPCH) have been synthesized and shown to cause pigment concentration in the shrimp ""Sicyonia ingentis"". This is the first report of peptide hormone-binding proteins in an invertebrate and provides further evidence of a role for RPCH as a neurotransmitte​r in the central nervous system."
