9,Abstract:,"An examination of a chronic mortality among cultured striped bass (""Morone saxatilis"") underyearlings showed signs typical of mycobacteriosis​. Diseased fish showed few to no outward signs of infection; internal signs included granulomas in the liver, kidney and spleen. Numerous acid fast bacteria were associated with these lesions and were easily observed in stained smears from affected organs. The isolate is presumed to be ""Mycobacterium marinum"" and further characterizatio​n is underway. As with mycobacteriosis in aquarium fish, the isolate from striped bass can produce substantial losses."
