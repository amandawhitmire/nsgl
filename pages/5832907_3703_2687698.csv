12,Abstract:,"Researchers collected samples of ""Anadyomene stellata"" from three geographically distinct populations off the coast of Greece and analyzed their chloroplast fatty acid compositions. Their objectives were to determine the natural substrates present for the fatty acid oxidative enzyme system present and to compare chloroplast fatty acid composition from various populations of the algae during the same season. Significant differences were observed among the three populations in the percent of total fatty acids for 12 of the 19 fatty acids present. High levels of C20 PUFAs, an atypical observation in Chlorophytes, were observed in all three populations and a 14:2 PUFA, apparently rare in marine macrophytic Chlorophytes, was identified in significant quantities. None of the conjugated tetraene containing fatty acids previously identified in other ""A. stellata"" populations were found."
