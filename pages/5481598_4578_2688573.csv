13,Abstract:,"Marine sponges of the order Halichondrida have provided an unprecedented array of sesquiterpene isonitriles, isothiocyanates​, and formamides. These metabolites are thought to inhibit feeding by omnivorous browsers, but they do not deter nudibranchs that are specific predators on the sponges. Reported here are the isolation and structural elucidation of 5-​isothiocyanatop​upukeanane from a sponge of the genus ""Axinyssa""."
