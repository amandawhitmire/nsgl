11,Abstract:,"Males and females of cultured white sturgeon, ""Acipenser transmontanus,"" mature at an average age of 4 and 8 years, respectively. However, the onset of ovarian vitellogenesis and puberty are highly asynchronous in the female stock. Gonadal cycles are annual in males and biennial in females, and gametogenesis is influenced by season. Neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction appears to involve a dual gonadotropin system controlling gonadal development and spawning. Labile puberty and sex-specific duration of the gonadal cycle are distinct characteristics of cultured and wild sturgeon. Photoperiod and temperature play a significant role in environmental regulation of the reproductive cycle, but further studies are necessary to elucidate the roles of endogenous and environmental factors in sturgeon reproduction, critically important for both aquaculture and conservation of endangered wild stocks."
