12,Abstract:,"On river floodplains in arid regions, establishment of riparian trees is often constrained by both abiotic and biotic factors. From 2004 to 2006, we conducted a field experiment along the Merced River in California's Central Valley to test the influence of distance to groundwater and direct irrigation (two abiotic factors) versus initial plant size and weed competition (two biotic factors) on seedling survival of four native tree species planted in floodplain dredge spoils. Treatment effects on survival were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model. Plant mortality was influenced most strongly by initial planting size in the first year, by irrigation treatment in the second year, and by elevation above groundwater in the third year. Weed competition did not affect survival of any species. In the first year, Box elder and Fremont cottonwood seedling mortality decreased 78 and 19 percent respectively with every 1-mm increase in basal diameter at planting. Similarly, Oregon ash mortality decreased 12 percent per extra centimeter in height. In the second year, irrigated plants survived better than unirrigated ones by 16 to 31 percent across species, and there was no residual effect of initial plant size. In the third year, planting elevation emerged as the most important influence; mortality was 67 to 124 percent higher per meter above the water table. These results are critical for effectively revegetating large areas of floodplain dredge spoils throughout the Central Valley. Furthermore, the methods used are applicable to other ecosystem restoration efforts where multiple ecological constraints on survival exist and teasing apart experimental and environmental influences is necessary."
