13,Abstract:,"Marine red algae (Rhodophyta) are a rich source of bioactive halogenated natural products, including cyclic terpenes. A while back scientists discovered that marine algal haloperoxidase enzymes provide an attractive basis from which to begin to elucidate the biosynthesis of halogenated marine natural products. Vanadium bromoperoxidase (V-BrPO) is particularly prevalent, having been found in all classes of marine algae. In this report researchers present for the first time evidence that V-BrPO isolated and cloned from marine red algae can catalyze the bromination and cyclization of terpenes and terpene analogues, producing cyclic structures similar to laurencin, a brominated C15 acetogenin, and alpha and beta snyderols, brominated sesquiterpenes from ""Laurencia"" spp."
