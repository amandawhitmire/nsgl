12,Abstract:,"This study is the first to use hypophysectomy to investigate the possible hypophyseal control of plasma calcitonin, thyroxine, and triiodothyronin​e levels in coho salmon. Another objective is to investigate the effects of environmental salinity and of three hormones, thyroxine, growth hormone, and cortisol, and osmotic regulation, calcium regulation, gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity, and plasma levels of calcitonin, thyroxine, triidothyronine​, and cortisol."
