9,Abstract:,"Physical ocean climate indicators illustrated strong upwelling in the region for the early months of 2013, while a relaxation event was observed mid-year. Sea surface temperatures were cold during most of the year, with warmer surface waters in summer and early fall. Sea surface salinities were high through April, followed by declining salinities for the remaining months. Sea surface heights were anomalously low through July then appeared to rise for the rest of the year. Strong alongshore winds and positive upwelling indices during the first half of the year also confirm the strong upwelling in the region, which has translated to an early spring transition date for 2013. Climate variables showed mixed results for 2013. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) showed mostly warm water conditions for the year, with a period (March-July) of cold water; these results likely reflect the ENSO-neutral conditions observed at the broader basin scale. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) values indicated cold water conditions for the North Pacific Ocean, while the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation also showed cold, productive waters (although less productive than in recent years). Biological ocean climate indicators echo results from the physical indicators. Starting at the base of the marine food web, we found phytoplankton abundance (as indicated by chlorophyll a concentrations) appeared highest during the early and latter parts of the year, coinciding with upwelling. The phytoplankton community consisted almost entirely of diatoms, which is a good indicator of productive ocean conditions. Zooplankton community composition results are not yet available for 2013. Results from the last two years (which had relatively similar ocean conditions to 2013) illustrate the effects of productive ocean conditions on overall zooplankton abundance, with increased zooplankton abundance compared to warm, poor productivity years (e.g. 2004-06), particularly for euphausiids and copepods. Analyses of zooplankton samples show two main clusters: the first three years (2004-06), and the next five years (2007-11). Results on various mid-trophic level species are not available for 2013. Copepod community composition results to date indicate large increases in the abundance of boreal copepods (i.e., species from northern latitudes which are generally considered better prey based on their larger size and greater lipid content) during cold, productive ocean conditions. Copepod species common to mid-latitudes also became more abundant in cold water years, although not as dramatically. Equatorial copepods (i.e., copepods from southern latitudes which are smaller and have less lipid content) increased in abundance in the September cruises some years. Pteropod abundance has remained relatively low throughout our time series, with significant increases in 2011. Euphausiid biomass results (as measured by acoustics) indicate a peak in krill densities in July 2013; over time, there appears to be declining krill abundances since 2009. Adult krill, which are larger and higher in lipid content than their younger counterparts, dominate the zooplankton samples during cold water years, including 2013; however, the percentage of adult stages appears to be declining since mid- 2010. The top-level predators in our region are represented by three resident breeding seabirds and two migrant whales. Cassin’s auklet, a zooplanktivorou​s seabird, was observed foraging on the shelf and near the shelf break in 2013; this species began breeding slightly early this year on SEFI and experienced high productivity. An omnivorous seabird species, the common murre, foraged more in nearshore waters and on shelf waters near SEFI in 2013, had an early start to breeding, experienced average breeding success, and fed mostly on rockfish. Brandt’s cormorants are piscivorous and were observed in low numbers near SEFI and in nearshore waters in 2013. This species had a slightly early start to breeding, experienced very high productivity (contrary to recent years of low breeding success), and consumed mostly rockfish species in 2013. For marine mammals in 2013, humpback whales were observed in higher numbers in the July and September cruises, and they were spotted on the shelf and near the shelf break. Blue whales peaked in abundance in September 2013 and were observed mostly on the shelf break, with a few sightings on the shelf."
