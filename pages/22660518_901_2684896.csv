13,Abstract:,"This study explored how nonnative bass affected both hatchery and wild juvenile salmon behavior on the Lower Mokelumne River California. The researchers combined experimental methods with modeling techniques to examine how habitat and salmon origin (hatchery vs. wild) influenced salmon antipredator behavior, and how these context-​dependent decisions scaled up to affect salmon populations."
