9,Abstract:,"Previous geological studies of the Oregon coastal region have identified several areas where strategic and economic heavy minerals (chromium-​bearing chromite, titanium-​bearing ilmenite, and zircon) and metal (gold) placer deposits occur in substantial quantites in modern beach and ancient uplifted marine terrace deposits. Previous investigations off southern Oregon strongly suggest that placer deposits occur on the shelf and that they may contain the same minerals and metals found in the adjacent coastal region. This study was conducted to determine if economic mineral phases occur within the surficial shelf sediments off Oregon and northern California."
