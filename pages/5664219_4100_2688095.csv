11,Abstract:,"The vast majority of sperm-egg interaction studies have been conducted using a limited number of species which possess gametes typified as representing the norm. The immediate image one has in regard to fertilization is that of a very aggressive cell, the motile sperm, and a recipient or passive cell, the egg, which requires direction from the sperm for activation. This image, however, in the case of at least one group, penaeoidean shrimp, is very misleading. First, penaeoid sperm are nonmotile and thus must be assisted in contacting an oocyte. Second, the penaeoid oocyte, when exposed to the outside world self-activates (parthenogenetiâ€‹cally activates) and appears to be completely ambivalent to the presence of a sperm until the time of cleavage; normal cleavage and subsequent development do not occur unless an activated sperm has fertilized an egg. This article reviews the process."
