9,Abstract:,"The excess momentum fluxes due to the presence of surface gravity waves, radiation stresses, are the principle driving forces for important coastal phenomena such as wave setup and longshore currents. Measurements of these stresses have practical value to coastal engineers and are routinely collected at various coastal sites. These data are often obtained with a `slope array', a small square array of four bottom-mounted pressure sensors."
