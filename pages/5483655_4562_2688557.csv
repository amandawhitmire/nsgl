12,Abstract:,"In many prior studies, particularly those on the halichondrid sponge ""Axinella cannabina"", investigators described isonitrile-​isothiocyanate-​formamide trios based on sesquiterpene skeletons that could be interrelated by the type of carbonium ion rearrangements commonly proposed in sesquiterpene biosynthesis. Although the biosynthetic origin of the isonitrile group remains an area of active research, earlier biosynthetic studies indicated that the isothiocyanates and formamides are derived from isonitriles. Recently, however, certain sesquiterpene isothiocyanates were found in marine sponges that did not contain the corresponding isonitriles and vice versa. In this paper the isolation of a unique sesquiterpene thiocyanate, three sesquiterpene isothiocyanates​, and a sesquiterpene formamide from a marine sponge ""Trachyopsis aplysinoides"", is described."
