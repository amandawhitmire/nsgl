13,Abstract:,"This study examined the movements of the shortfin mako shark ""Isurus oxyrinchus"" in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Makos occurring within the SCB are of special concern because this region is one of the few documented nursery habitats in the North Pacific. Although commercially fished, there is little information about the population dynamics, migratory patterns, or fine-scale movements of makos within the SCB. This investigation used a noninvasive tag attachment technique whereby sharks volitionally ingested transmitters. The study addresses the following questions. How do physical conditions within the track area (e.g., submarine topography, sea surface temperature, time of day) and factors such as body size and stomach temperature relate to mako swimming depth and habitat utilization? Are there differences in habitat utilization among the different mako year classes (years 0, 1, 2) most frequently found in the SCB?"
