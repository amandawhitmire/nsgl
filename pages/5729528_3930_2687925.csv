9,Abstract:,"Previous research has shown that one species of flatfish displays several functional asymmetries of the head and jaws during prey capture. In order to determine whether functional asymmetry is present in other flatfish taxa, prey-capture behavior was examined in a species of flatfish with little cephalic morphological asymmetry, ""Xystreurys liolepis,"" and in which both typical (sinistral) and reversed (dextral) individuals are commonly found. Five individuals (two dextral and three sinistral) were video taped feeding in order to quantify prey-capture kinematics. Results suggest that certain morphological asymmetries of the jaws of flatfishes are modifications for specialized prey-capture behaviors."
