11,Abstract:,"In December of 1995 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published their final rule, 'Procedures for the Safe and Sanitary Processing and Importing of Fish and Fishery Products', with an implementation date of December 18, 1997. The regulations mandate the application of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles to the processing of seafood because a system of preventive controls is the most effective and efficient way to ensure that these products are safe. This publication is intended to provide mussel processors with information on the HACCP concept and on developing HACCP plans for mussel processing. The information should be used only as a guide. Written HACCP plans must be species, plant, and process specific, and must reflect the actual processing and handling conditions found in each seafood plant."
