10,Abstract:,"This paper attempts to integrate our current understanding of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) as a mediator of the growth- promoting and hypoosmoregulatâ€‹ory effects of growth hormone (GH) in teleost fishes. In these fishes, IGF activity and its control by GH are evident as judged by ""in vivo"" growth studies, by ""in vitro"" sulfation studies, and by gene cloning. In addition, IGF- binding proteins (IGFBPs) are present and may play important roles in regulating IGF. The basic mechanisms of GH-IGF-IGFBP interaction in the mammalian system of growth regulation seem to be operative in this group of fishes; this suggests that the fundamental pattern was established in early ancestral vertebrates and maintained during phylogeny."
