12,Abstract:,"This proceedings contains 24 papers presented at a scientific diving symposium held in September, 1992. The American Academy of Underwater Sciences sponsors these symposia to disseminate information and to stimulate discussion on the advancement of undersea science and technology. Diving safety is also an important research and operational focus of the Academy. Topics range from underwater archeology in a blackwater environment to observations of nocturnal and crepuscular activity of reef fish. The following papers are included in this proceedings: 1. Underwater archaeology by Braille: survey methodology and site characterizatio​n modeling in a blackwater environment--a study of a scuttled confederate ironclad, C.S.S. Georgia. R. J. Anuskiewiz and E. Garrison pp. 1-12. 2. Visual census as a means to estimate standing biomass, length, and growth in fishes. S. A. Bortone, et al. pp. 13-21. 3. Environmental sampling tools designed for use on a low cost remotely operated vehicles (LCROV). R. M. Brown, et al. pp. 23- 30. 4. Preliminary investigation: platform removal and associated biota. A. Scarborough-​Bull and J. J. Kendall pp. 31-38. 5. Oxygen safety in the production of enriched air nitrox breathing mixtures. G. J. Butler, et al. 39-50. 6. Sampling small invertebrates at the sediment-water interface. L. B. Cahoon, et al. pp. 51-59. 7. Characteristics of benthic microalgae from the North Carolina outer shelf and slope: preliminary results. L. B. Cahoon, et al. pp. 61-68. 8. Emergency breathing system for helium-oxygen diving to 300 feet of seawater. J.M. Chimiak pp. 69-72. 9. Quantifying pelagic spawning rushes in labroid fishes: preliminary comparison of video and direct diver visual techniques. L. E. Clavijo and D.G. Lindquist pp. 73-76. 10. Subtidal observations of the prickly shark, ""Echinorhinus cookei"" in the Monterey Submarine Canyon, California. N. L. Crane and J. N. Heine pp. 77-81. 11. Seasonal and annual variations in the underwater light environment of an Arctic kelp community. K. H. Dunton, et al. pp. 83-92. 12. Aquarius habitat site at conch reef: possibilities for research on foraminifera with algal symbionts. P. Hallock, et al. pp. 93-98. 13. Nocturnal and crepuscular activity of reef fishes in Onslow Bay, North Carolina: results from scuba, video, and remotely operated vehicle operations. D. G. Lindquist and I. E. Clavijo pp. 99-107. 14.
