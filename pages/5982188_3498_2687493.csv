10,Abstract:,"Synthetic musk compounds, widely used as fragrances in consumer products, have been detected in human tissue and in aquatic organisms such as fish and mollusks. Here, researchers show that nitromusks and polycyclic musks inhibit the activity of multidrug efflux transporters responsible for multixenobiotic resistance in gills of the marine mussel ""Mytilus californianus"". The immediate consequence of inhibition of efflux transporters is that normally excluded xenobiotics will now be able to enter the cell. Remarkably, the inhibitory effects of a 2-hr exposure to musks were only partially reversed after a 24- to 48-hr recovery period in clean seawater. This unexpected consequence of synthetic musks -- a long-term loss of efflux transport activity -- will result in continued accumulation of normally excluded toxicants even after direct exposure to the musk has ended."
