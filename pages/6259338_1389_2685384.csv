20,Abstract:,"Dormitator latifrons, an eleotridae fish, is widely distributed along the Pacific Coast of the Americas from Southern California to Northern Peru. Variously known as chame, popoyote or puyeque in Ecuador, Central America and Mexico, its pattern of consumption varies considerably over its range. In some areas such as the province of Manabi, Ecuador, it is a prized fish species. It is a valuable fisheries resource in southern Mexico, with 350 MT fished in 2005. Most commonly, it is considered a fish of last resort, consumed during hard times when other foods are scarce. Its flesh is firm, white and has a mild flavor. D. latifrons reproduces naturally in earthen ponds, and fingerlings are captured coastal wetland areas; hence fingerlings have been traditionally obtained in this way in Ecuador for extensive culture. This fish is extremely hardy, being euryhaline (0-42 ppt tolerance range), is omnivorous with detrivore habits, and can survive several days out of the water. D. latifrons is closely associated with freshwater and brackish water wetlands. Given these characteristics​, this species appeared to be a natural candidate for aquaculture development in Ecuador, as part of an integrated coastal management program sponsored by the Sustainable Coastal Communities and Ecosystems (SUCCESS) and related efforts supported by the Aquaculture and Fisheries Collaborative Research Support Program (AquaFish CRSP), both funded by USAID. In 2005, work began in Cojimies, Ecuador with culture trials conducted with small-scale farmers. Culture of D. latifrons was chosen as an alternative livelihood for the coastal management effort due to its linkage with threatened wetlands, the possibility of polyculture with shrimp, and to provide a monoculture species for poorer stakeholders without resources for shrimp culture. Considerable success was encountered in both monoculture and polyculture of this fish. Fish up to 220 g have been obtained in six months using extensive methods; up to 450 g can be obtained using formulated feeds. In the case of extensive culture, fish were stocked at a rate of 1-2/m2. Feeding was variable, ranging from locally available sources such as ground corn and green plaintains, supplemented in the case of polyculture with commercial shrimp feed. Fertilization was also practiced. In 2008, the AquaFish CRSP supported a study of the potential for further regional development of D. latifrons for aquaculture. Potential was found to be high, if the problem of hatchery production of juveniles can be overcome. Protection of coastal wetlands is also key to maintaining this species as a viable fisheries resource."
