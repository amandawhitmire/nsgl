9,Abstract:,"Mercury is a naturally occurring metallic substance. Minute quantities of mercury are in air, water, soil, and all living matter. Mercury exists as both inorganic and organic forms, and the organic methyl mercury is the most toxic to humans. Mercury vaporizes into the air from natural soil deposits. Rain washes mercury out of the air and returns it to rivers, lakes, oceans, and the soil. This cycle of vaporization and washing-out has probably taken place since the earth formed. Because plants and animals evolved in the earth's environment, all contain trace quantities of mercury."
