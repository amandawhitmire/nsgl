11,Abstract:,"Isonitriles are rare in nature, yet they are frequently found in sponges of the order Halichondrida and in the dorsal mantle of nudibranchs that eat halichondrid sponges. The Palauan sponge ""Halichondria"" sp. has now been found to contain four diterpene isonitriles, one which had physical and spectral properties identical with a compound previously reported by Kazlauskas et al. (1980). Their structures are reported here."
