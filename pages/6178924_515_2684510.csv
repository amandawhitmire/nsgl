11,Abstract:,"California Grunion are marine silversides that appear on sandy beaches in the middle of the night for spawning runs. Their populations are difficult to assess because they rarely come up in trawls, they do not take a hook, and they are almost never seen except during their spectacular midnight runs. Recently we developed a method for training citizen scientists to assess grunion runs in widely dispersed areas and to report them instantly to a central database via an internet-based interface. A series of workshops were held in spring of 2004 to train over 350 volunteer Grunion Greeters from four coastal counties. Runs were monitored on 30 specific beaches from San Diego to Monterey Bay over the course of closed season (April and May), and early June, for a total of 10 nights. Runs were assessed according to the Walker Scale for strength and duration. Runs were highly variable in space and time. We show data for grunion populations across the spawning season and along the coast to examine possible patterns. Although these data are only one year's effort, the number of dates and beaches represented make this the most ambitious assessment of the California grunion spawning population ever attempted."
