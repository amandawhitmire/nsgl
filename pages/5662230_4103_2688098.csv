11,Abstract:,"The Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") supports an important commercial and sport fishery on the Pacific coast of North America. Dungeness crabs from coastal Washington, Oregon and California have been found to be infected by a microsporidian parasite with unusual needle-like spores. The structure of the parasite does not conform to that of any microsporidian described in the key to microsporidian genera by Larsson. It replicates in the musculature of the crab host causing a whitish, opaque gross external appearance typical of other crustacean muscle-​infecting microsporidians​. In this study, ""Nadelspora canceri"", a new genus and species of microsporidian parasite is described based upon light and electron microscopic observations of infected Dungeness crab tissue."
