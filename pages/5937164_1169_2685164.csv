13,Abstract:,"Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") was among the three most valuable commercial fisheries in California in seven of the last ten years. The ""sex-​size-​season"" regulatory system in California induces an annual derby fishery that results in a temporally compressed pulse of landings. The fishery relies on a few large receiver/proces​sors capable of freezing and storing large quantities of crab. Research on former derby fisheries indicates that improved economic conditions (more valuable fresh product forms and more competitive processing) can be obtained if landings are temporally distributed. Should the derby fishery for Dungeness crab be eliminated? This article addresses part of the question by providing baseline economic information for this industry, including the mix of product forms and prices, value added, capital stock, and employment."
