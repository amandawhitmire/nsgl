8,Abstract:,"he New Zealand mudsnail is an introduced aquatic species that has invaded estuaries, lakes, rivers, and streams in Washington, Oregon, California, and many other states in the western U.S. Its small size (<5 mm), cryptic coloration, and ability to survive out of water for weeks make it an ideal hitchhiker. This brochure informs anglers, hunters, and field personnel how to identify the New Zealand mudsnail and how to treat waders, boots, nets, buckets, and other field gear to prevent the spread of the snails from one body of water to another. he brochure is free of charge (one copy to a customer). A high-resolution pdf of the brochure can also be downloaded from http://seagrant​. oregonstate.edu​/sgpubs/onlinep​ubs.html."
