11,Abstract:,"In salmonids, growth hormone (GH) effectively promotes adaptation of freshwater fish to seawater (SW), but it has been unclear whether GH has osmoregulatory actions apart from those consequent to an increase in body size. Objectives here were to examine the minimum time and dose required for GH to enhance SW adaptation, and to optimize the conditions for the acute GH response in developing a convenient GH bioassay based on its plasma ion lowering effect. Results showed that GH exerts acute osmoregulatory actions that promote SW adaptation in the absence of changes in body size. Compared with growth GH bioassays, the osmoregulatory assay is superior in economy of time, animal costs, and hormone quantity required, and potentially in specificity."
