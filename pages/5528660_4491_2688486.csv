10,Abstract:,"Gorgonian corals are soft-bodied marine invertebrates which are conspicuous inhabitants of predator-rich tropical marine habitats. As part of ongoing studies of the chemical defensive adaptations of these organisms, four new trisnorditerpen​oids, norasperenals A-D, and two previously reported cyclic ketals have been isolated from an undescribed species of the Caribbean gorgonian ""Eunicea."" The structures of the new compounds, determined by combined spectral methods, illustrate a unique loss of a C3 fragment from a regular diterpenoid precursor."
