11,Abstract:,"Biological control, as used in terrestrial systems, may hold promise for use against exotic marine species. This paper reviews some marine pests, displaying their diversity, the damage they cause, and possible controls. Approaches for marine and terrestrial pest control are contrasted providing guidelines for adapting terrestrial controls to the marine environment. Although several of the same principles apply, marine systems differ with respect to the types of control agents available, the degree of pest-population reduction needed, the spatial scale over which biological control must operate effectively, the practicality of implementation, and the nature and degree of concern over safety. The paper concludes that biological control may be possible for some marine pests, but that existing strategies and expectations will require modification."
