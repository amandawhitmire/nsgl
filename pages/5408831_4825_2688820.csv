9,Abstract:,"The importance of prolactin for freshwater adaptation has become increasingly well recognized for several euryhaline teleosts including ""Gillichthys""; prolactin maintains plasma Na and Cl levels in a hypoosmotic environment. In the present experiments, the feasibility of assessing the osmoregulatory ability of ""G. mirabilis"" in different concentrations of seawater by measuring the transepithelial potential (TEP) ""in vivo"" is examined. The effect of prolactin by comparison of TEP of hypophysectomizâ€‹ed fish with and without a rostral pars distalis autotransplant during adaptation to a hypotonic environment is also examined."
