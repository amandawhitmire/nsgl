10,Abstract:,"This investigation provides the first evidence for oriented cell division during gastrulation in a simple invertebrate system. Embryos of the penaeoidean shrimp ""Sicyonia ingentis"" were examined at intervals during cleavage and gastrulation. Oriented cell division has previously been discounted as a potential morphogenetic force, and may be a common mechanism of invagination in embryos that begin gastrulation with a relatively small number of cells."
