10,Abstract:,"Aplidiamine (1), a unique zwitterionic benzyl substituted hydroxyadenine, has been isolated from the marine ascisian ""Aplidiopsis"" sp. collected in Western Australia. The structure of aplidiamine was determined by spectral analysis of the natural product and of several derivatives produced by diazomethane methylation."
