10,Abstract:,"Although acoustic surveys of fish populations offers a non-invasive way to assess populations they typically suffer from a lack of specificity. As one option to increase the accuracy of bioacoustic methods we have been exploring the potential advantages of recording backscattered sound from a multiplicity of view points. Potential benefits are shape estimations, in-situ orientation, as well as perhaps some degree of species differentiationâ€‹. In order to investigate this idea, we have conducted a series of laboratory experiments to collect multi-view measurements on a range of fish species and to experiment with algorithms. Preliminary results, presented here, indicate that both length and orientation can be estimated using a small set of measurements viewed over a limited set of views. Initial results also indicate that it is possible to discriminate among a limited number of taxa via analysis of recordings from individuals. We conclude that multi view methods can increase bioacoustic system performance and that the accuracy of inferences increases as additional views are made available."
