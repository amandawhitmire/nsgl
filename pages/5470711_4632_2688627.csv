8,Abstract:,"The initiation of the molting process (the entrance into pre-molt) in crustaceans is mediated by the steroid hormone 20-​hydroxyecdysone​. The mechanism of action of 20-​hydroxyecdysone is of particular interest to invertebrate endocrinology, since so many tissues of the crustacean are involved in the molting process and because of the multiple effects of this hormone at the molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. This review briefly summarizes a few historical aspects and then examines in greater detail recent advances in the understanding of the metabolism of the molting hormone, its mechanism of action upon target tissues, and the regulation of the circulating concentration of the hormone by a neuropeptide."
