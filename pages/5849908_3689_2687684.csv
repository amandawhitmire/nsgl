10,Abstract:,"The sabellid polychaete ""Terebrasabella heterouncinata"" arrived as an epizoic contaminant on South African abalone imported to California for commercial aquaculture research. Fears concerning environmental contamination were realized in 1996, when researchers discovered a substantial population of these sabellids below the water discharge outflow of a heavily infested abalone mariculture facility. They implemented an eradication strategy based on the epidemiological theorem of the threshold host density for transmission. By removing as many susceptible hosts as was feasible from the contaminated area, they intended to raise the threshold of transmission so high that the sabellid population could not attain replacement levels of recruitment. Here they report the effectiveness of this approach and the success of the sabellid eradication program."
