13,Abstract:,"White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is currently the most important viral pathogen infecting penaeid shrimp worldwide. Although considerable progress has been made in characterizing the WSSV genome, information pertaining to host genes is limited. In order to gain further insight into viral immunity and WSSV pathogenesis in shrimp, scientists used cDNA microassay analysis to compare the gene expression patterns in the hepatopancreas tissues of healthy and WSSV-infected shrimp. The hepatopancreas is involved in initiating the humoral defense response in shrimp. Therefore, identification of cellular genes whose expression is altered upon WSSV infection in this tissue may help to elucidate the pathways that are critical to WSSV pathogenesis. Accumulation of gene expression data may also provide clues for identifying novel therapeutic targets."
