13,Abstract:,"An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) designed for survey and exploration operations to depths of 6000 m is described. The vehicle is designed for full autonomy but will also be capable of remote operation via an acoustic link in a supervisory control mode. At abyssal depths, elimination of the tether required for towed platform and remotely operated vehicle operations results in a comparatively high-speed, maneuverable platform for near-bottom surveys. The light weight (under 200 kg) and minimal surface support requirements allow the vehicle to operate from virtually any ship of opportunity. The vehicle's low cost, under $50,000, opens the door to multiple vehicle operations for greatly increased survey rates."
