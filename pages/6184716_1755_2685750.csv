11,Abstract:,"Experiments were carried out to assess the fortnightly effects of mixed semi-diurnal tides and tidally-induced aquifer overheight on the timing, magnitude, and quality of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) from an unconfined beach aquifer impacted by septic tank effluent at Stinson Beach, California. Groundwater- and ocean elevations, salinity, and nutrient concentrations were monitored throughout a 14-day neap/spring cycle. A freshening of the surf zone coupled with an increase in nutrient concentrations was observed at neap tide and attributed to discharge of fresh, nutrient-rich groundwater during that part of the fortnight. Nutrient concentrations in the surf zone returned to near-offshore levels during the spring tide. Estimates of SGD were made with chemically- and physically-â€‹based methods. Fresh SGD was maximal during the neap tide although total SGD was maximal during the spring tide. An overheight of time-averaged piezometric head was observed in the aquifer near the beach face throughout the 14-day experiment. This overheight varied significantly with tidal range, thereby controlling the seaward hydraulic gradient across the fresh part of the aquifer and, thus, the flow of nutrient-rich fresh groundwater to the coastal ocean. We discuss the role of aquifer overheight in controlling submarine discharge of fresh groundwater and related nonpoint source pollution from unconfined aquifers in similar environments."
