10,Abstract:,"The secondary metabolites from Indo-Pacific sponges have included a rich array of anthelminthic nitrogen derivatives. Two different species of ""Xestospongia,"" easily distinguished by a dissimilarity in their compressibilityâ€‹, were collected from a variety of habitats in Fiji. They have yielded new amino alcohols, xestoaminols A-C. One species, in shipboard tests of its aqueous and nonaqueous exudates, showed strong activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Similarly, the other species yielded an organic extract that showed broad-spectrum activity against a parasite, microbes, and reverse transcriptase."
