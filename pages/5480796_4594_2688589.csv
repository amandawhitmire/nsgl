9,Abstract:,"Despite the importance of the spermatophore in decapod reproduction, little is known about its formation and packaging at the ultrastructural level. Here, light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to examine the structure of the vas deferens and its role in the formation of the spermatophore wall in the crayfish ""Cherax albidus"". ""Cherax"" provides a particularly good system for this type of analysis, since its vas deferens is relatively simple and does not appear to have the complex functional subdivisions found in some decapods such as ""Homarus americanus"" and ""Penaeus setiferus""."
