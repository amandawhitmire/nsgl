10,Abstract:,"The briaranes are a group of highly oxidized diterpenes that have been obtained from gorgonians, soft corals and sea pens. Several species of the gorgonian ""Junceella"" from the South China Sea, the Red Sea, and the Great Barrier Reef have been studied and all contained diterpenes of the briarane class. This paper reports the structures of six new chlorinated diterpenes, gemmacolides A- F, from a Pohnpei collection of ""Junceella gemmacea""."
