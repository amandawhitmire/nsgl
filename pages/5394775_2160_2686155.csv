8,Abstract:,"The work described arose from research to determine the cause of cyclic fluctuations in catches of Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") on the west coast of the United States. Briefly, several density-​dependent recruitment mechanisms (e.g. cannibalism, predation by an egg-predator worm, density-​dependent fecundity or larval survival) have been investigated and some of them remain as possible causes. Statistical analyses of similarities between the catch record and several environmental variables (e.g. upwelling, temperature, number of sunspots, and wind stress) have led to proposals that they cause the cycles. How differences in life history, form of the density-​dependent recruitment relationship, and harvest rate affect the ways in which recruitment, catch, and abundance are influenced by environmental forcing variables are examined."
