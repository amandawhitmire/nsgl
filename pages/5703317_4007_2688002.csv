12,Abstract:,"As with other world fisheries, commercial abalone landings have declined at an exponential rate for the past two decades. In an attempt to meet consumer demand in the face of a diminishing resource supply, abalone aquaculture has been expanding; however, efforts to meet the gap between supply and demand have been hampered by the slow and highly variable growth rates of abalone. In order to develop abalone and other shellfish species with advantageous characteristics in a shorter time frame, efforts have turned toward the use of modern molecular genetics and gene transfer technologies. This preliminary study demonstrates that electroporation is an efficient means of transferring foreign DNA into abalone embryos."
