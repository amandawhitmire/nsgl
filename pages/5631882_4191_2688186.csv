10,Abstract:,"Molecular signals, receptors and signal transducers that regulate reproduction, development and growth can be used as control points to overcome limitations to production at these stages, and thus increase the economic efficiency and yield of molluscan aquaculture. The cloned genes and cDNAs also provide useful tools both for analysis of the regulatory mechanisms controlling reproduction, development and growth, and for the manipulation of these processes. Examples from research with abalone (""Haliotis""), and needs for future research in molluscan and other animal systems, are discussed."
