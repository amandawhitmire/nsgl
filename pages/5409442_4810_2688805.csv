8,Abstract:,"In this paper, a number of extensions of a recent theory for the estimation of stock abundance by encounter rates are presented. These extensions include non-Bayesian confidence intervals, multiple and unknown detection rates, learning by the fisherman, and clumping of the stock. In some cases, the extended theory is illustrated by application to a data set."
