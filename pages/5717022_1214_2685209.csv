12,Abstract:,"Experience with Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs) in recent hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico has indicated the need to reassess where and how these units are sited. There are fundamental issues that need to be resolved regarding policies and guidelines for manning, positioning and mooring semi-​submersible drilling units in the Gulf during the hurricane season. Developing frameworks for modeling operation and evacuation plans for various weather conditions can assist in creating decision criteria. This work addresses the development of such a framework and evaluates various MODU securing alternatives using probabilistic risk analysis (PRA)."
