9,Abstract:,"The abundance of chitin in both the marine and terrestrial environments has led to an interest in developing processes to modify chitin structure and to develop it as a utilizable carbohydrate. Current processes use severe chemical reactions that generate unwanted by-products, eliminate potentially important polymers, and reduce chain length. We describe here a biological approach, namely the construction and isolation of recombinant plasmids that contain the ""Vibrio harveyi"" structural genes for chitinase, chitobiase, and possibly a permease for chitobiose."
