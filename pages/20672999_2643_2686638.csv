8,Abstract:,"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a management tool used to protect andsustain many ecologically and economically important fish species from overexploitatio​nby recreational and commercial fishing. Lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) and some of itsprey species, such as rockfish (Sebastes spp.), are species that are protected from fishingin some California MPAs. Lingcod is an apex predator that consumes a variety of fishand invertebrate species. In this study, I sought to assess the effect of an MPA on theabundance, size and diet of Lingcod. I hypothesized that Lingcod in a no-take MPAwould be more abundant and larger than Lingcod in an adjacent reference site (REF) thatwas open to fishing. Furthermore, I hypothesized that diet would differ between Lingcodin caught the MPA and Lingcod in the REF. I collected Lingcod from the Point BuchonState Marine Reserve (MPA) and an adjacent REF site that was open to fishing. Imeasured, weighed, sexed, and collected stomach contents from Lingcod using thegastric lavage (stomach pumping) technique. Then, I identified prey items from Lingcodstomach contents down to the lowest taxonomic level possible and quantified dietcomposition by percent by occurrence, percent by number, and percent by mass. Lingcodin the MPA consumed more fish prey items than Lingcod in the REF site. Lingcod in theREF consumed more cephalopod prey items than Lingcod in the MPA. I analyzed thefour most common prey items (rockfish, anchovies, flatfish, and octopus) for nutritionalcont​ent. My data suggest that Lingcod increased in size and abundance in a no-takeMPA because they do not suffer from fishing mortality. However, a more nutritious dietcould also contribute to a biologically significant advantage for Lingcod in the MPA. Toaddress this would require further research focused on calculating the net energy (grossenergy extracted from the prey item minus the energetic costs of handling and digestingthe prey item) obtained by Lingcod from consuming different fish and cephalopod preyitems. MPAs can be an effective management tool for protecting fish stocks, although, itis important to understand the interspecific interactions between predator and preyspecies to adaptively mange MPAs and the species that reside within them."
