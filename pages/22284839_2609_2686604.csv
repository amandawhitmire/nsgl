26,Abstract:,"Seafood is an essential source of protein formore than 3 billion peopleworldwide​, yet bycatch of threatened species in capture fisheries remains a major impediment to fisheries sustainability. Management measures designed to reduce bycatch often result in significant economic losses and even fisheries closures. Static spatial management approaches can also be rendered ineffective by environmental variability and climate change, as productive habitats shift and introduce new interactions between human activities and protected species. We introduce a new multispecies and dynamic approach that uses daily satellite data to track ocean features and aligns scales of management, species movement, and fisheries. To accomplish this, we create species distribution models for one target species and three bycatch-​sensitive species using both satellite telemetry and fisheries observer data. We then integrate species-​specific probabilities of occurrence into a single predictive surface,weighin​g the contribution of each species by management concern. We find that dynamic closures could be 2 to 10 times smaller than existing static closures while still providing adequate protection of endangered nontarget species. Our results highlight the opportunity to implement near realtime management strategies that would both support economically viable fisheries andmeet mandated conservation objectives in the face of changing ocean conditions. With recent advances in eco-​informatics, dynamic management provides a new climate-ready approach to support sustainable fisheries."
