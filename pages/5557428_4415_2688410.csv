11,Abstract:,"The study of the anthelmintic terpenoid components from the Fiji sponge ""Axinyssa fenestratus"" (senior synonym of ""Leucophloeus fenestratus"") and two Thailand sponges, ""Acanthella cavernosa"" and ""Topsentia"" sp., has yielded several new nitrogen-​containing sesqui- and diterpenes of known carbon skeletons. The new compounds are described along with their anti-parasitic properties."
