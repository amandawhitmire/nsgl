9,Abstract:,"During its nine years of participation in the national Sea Grant Institutional Program, USC has continued its commitment to solving regional problems and adapting to changing needs. The 1978-79 program was no exception. The goals of USC's marine research program have historically paralleled those of the National Sea Grant College and Program Act of 1966. As that program has changed, so has the USC program. The National m Sea Grant Program has increasingly sought to stress the involvement of the scientific community as well as the needs of the user community in its selection of projects. USC's commitment to applied marine research dates back to the early 1900s, and through the years university faculty and staff have worked with representatives of the public and local industry to solve marine and coastal problems of importance to the region. This is a report of the University of Southern California's ninth year of participation in the Sea Grant program. Subsequent sections contain summaries of the results of projects in marine resource development, socio-â€‹economics, environmental quality, coastal engineering, marine advisory services, and marine education and training."
