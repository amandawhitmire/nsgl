8,Abstract:,"The profitability of aquaculture has been constrained by the difficulty of managing phytoplankton biomass and growth. This review examines problems caused by uncontrolled phytoplankton dynamics, considers causes of these problems, and assesses the effectiveness of methods used to manage phytoplankton in aquacultural ponds. Most algae-related problems can be attributed to excessive algal biomass (off-flavor, inefficient fish production, poor quality of discharge water) or to non-optimal growth conditions (insufficient dissolved oxygen, propensity to die off). Although conclusive evidence is lacking, evaluation suggests that most algal die-offs result from severe nutrient depletion. The data on off-flavor are similarly limited, but suggest that many taxa, in addition to blue-greens, may cause off-flavor in fish. Most attempts to manage algal dynamics (i.e., herbicides, dyes, nutrient competition, biological control with fish, manipulation of nutrient ratios, and pathogenic control) are ineffective, and many may exacerbate problems associated with algal growth. Biological control appears the most favorable control mechanism, but remains an elusive goal."
