12,Abstract:,"In high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regimes, iron additions consistently result in primary productivity increases, and the phytoplankton community shifts from small species toward large diatoms. Heterotrophic bacterial production and abundance also increase in HNLC Fe addition experiments, but whether changes in bacterioplankto​n community composition also occur when Fe is added is unknown. Here researchers used trace metal clean shipboard incubation experiments and molecular biological methods to examine this question in three Fe-limited environments: the sub arctic Pacific, the subantarctic Southern Ocean and the California coastal upwelling region. In general, iron- mediated changes in bacterial communities in all three environments were surprisingly minor compared to the changes in phytoplankton community composition on this time scale (4-5 days)."
