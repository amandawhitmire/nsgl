10,Abstract:,"Recent evidence suggests that PKX, the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease (PKD), is a myxozoan parasite of salmonid fishes. Because the PKX parasite seemingly fails to complete sporulation and invokes such an intense immune response, salmonids may be aberrant hosts for the pathogen. An abundant native cyprinid, the tui chub, proved to be parasitized by a myxosporean with similar sporogonic stages to those detected in fish recovering from PKD. The early sporogonic stages were later seen to develop in the chub into a mature ""Sphaerospora"" sp. PKX and ""Sphaerospora"" have similar developmental stages. At present one can only speculate whether the parasites in the chub and salmonids are identical, but cross-infection studies in progress should provide some insight."
