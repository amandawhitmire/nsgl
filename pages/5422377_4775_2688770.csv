9,Abstract:,"Omnivores are able to alter the structure and functions of their digestive system in response to changes in dietary carbohydrate content. Studies here demonstrate that the rainbow trout, a carnivore, is unable to adaptively regulate digestive system structure and function to increase glucose availability in response to increasing levels of dietary carbohydrates. Paradoxically, a reduction in the concentrations of carbohydrate enzymes in response to elevated carbohydrates suggests that carnivores may actually try to repress carbohydrate digestion when glucose is available in high quantities. Thus the lower levels of carbohydrate in the diet of trout throughout their evolution has resulted in a reduced ability to phenotypically regulate the digestion of carbohydrates."
