12,Abstract:,"This study addresses mechanisms of hybridization between a rare invader, smooth cordgrass and the common native California cordgrass in the salt marshes of San Francisco Bay. These species are wind-pollinated and flower in summer. The invader produced 21-fold the viable pollen of the native, and 28% of invader pollen germinated on native stigmas. This pollen swamping and superior siring ability by the invader could lead to serial genetic assimilation of a very large native population. This will lead to habitat loss for shore birds and marine life as well to genetic pollution of native California cordgrass."
