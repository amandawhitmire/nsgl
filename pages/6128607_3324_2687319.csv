6,Abstract:,"A basic physiological explanation of why rockfish are prone to pressure-​induced injuries. Every rockfish has a gas-filled organ called a swim bladder that expands and contracts to control its buoyancy. When a fish is caught and reeled in, this mechanism for moving vertically in the water column is thrown out of whack. The brochure discusses the pros and cons of different methods for returning fish to depth quickly and shows pictures of these devices."
