8,Abstract:,"The use of vacuum packaging, hypobaric conditions, and atmospheres based on gas blends, as well as the possible food safety implications of the application of such technologies, are reviewed in this paper. Oxygen depletion or CO2 addition are effective in retarding the growth of the typical aerobic spoilage bacteria in muscle foods. Yet there is a possibility that when such foods are temperature-â€‹abused they may become unsafe, especially with respect to ""Clostridium botulinum"". The question of whether or not spoilage may precede toxigenesis and thus alarm the processor or the consumer has not been fully clarified. Lack of such knowledge has remained the limiting factor to greater commercial expansion, especially by the fish industry."
