15,Abstract:,"Replication of human immunodeficienc​y virus (HIV) entails expression of several viral polyproteins which require the presence of a virus-specific protease for their maturation. Inhibition of this enzyme results in immature viral particles and inhibition of viral replication in vitro. HIV-1 protease is therefore an exciting target for mechanism-based natural product screening in order to identify candidates for development of chemotherapeuti​cs for AIDS. The magenta ascidian ""Didemnum"" sp. was collected by hand (-1 m) at Auluptagel Island, Palau. The sample was stored at -20 deg. C for several years until the HIV-1 protease inhibition assay revealed bioactivity in a crude extract. Inhibition of HIV-1 protease by didemnaketals A and B was measured by using a peptidolysis assay."
