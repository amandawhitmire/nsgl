9,Abstract:,"California's experience with ocean management since the 1960s is analyzed in comparison to a set of factors or conditions which appear to facilitate the initiation and sustenance of ocean management efforts in other states. The application of these factors to the California context highlights the challenges which California's newly-created Ocean Resources Task Force will confront as it attempts to develop and implement an ocean management agenda. These factors include the state's maritime tradition, the existing organization of marine affairs in the state, the many conflicts that occur among diverse ocean users, and the changing political climate, among both political elites and the public."
