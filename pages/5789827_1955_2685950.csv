13,Abstract:,"The authors report the discovery and spread of a distinctly dwarf ecotype of introduced smooth cordgrass in San Francisco Bay. This dwarf ecotype has evolved since the introduction of ""S. alterniflora"" to San Francisco Bay from Maryland in the 1970s. The new ecotype differs ecologically from typical or 'wild-type' ""S. alterniflora"" and also differs significantly from the previously reported 'short- form' ""S. alterniflora""."
