12,Abstract:,"Members of the marine actinomycete genus Salinispora constitutively produce a characteristic ​ orange pigment during vegetative growth. Contrary to the understanding of widespread carotenoid biosynthesis pathways in bacteria, Salinispora carotenoid biosynthesis genes are not confined to a single cluster. Instead, bioinformatic and genetic investigations ​ confirm that four regions of the Salinispora tropica CNB-440 genome, consisting of two gene clusters and two independent genes, contribute to the in vivo production of a single carotenoid. This compound, namely (2′S)-​1′-​(β-​D-​glucopyranosylo​xy)-​3′,4′-​ didehydro-​1′,2′-​dihydro-​φ,ψ-​caroten-​2′-​ol, is novel and has been given the trivial name ‘sioxanthin’. Sioxanthin is a C40-carotenoid, glycosylated on one end of the molecule and containing an aryl moiety on the opposite end. Glycosylation is unusual among actinomycete carotenoids, and sioxanthin joins a rare group of carotenoids with polar and non-polar head groups. Gene sequence homology predicts that the sioxanthin biosynthetic pathway is present in all of the Salinispora as well as other members of the family Micromonosporac​eae. Additionally, this study’s investigations of clustering of carotenoid biosynthetic genes in heterotrophic bacteria show that a non-clustered genome arrangement is more common than previously suggested, with nearly half of the investigated genomes showing a non-​clustered architecture."
