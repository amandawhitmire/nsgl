11,Abstract:,"Previous studies indicate that cold filaments off northern California have sharp southern and diffuse northern thermal boundaries. In this study, 44 satellite images taken from three coastal regions in the California Current system over a period of 10 years were used to examine the regional variation in surface frontal structure associated with cold filaments. The recurrent, ubiquitous patterns found in the satellite-â€‹determined frontal structure are discussed in terms of their potential effects on acoustic propagation and regional implications on ecological community structure in the California Current system."
