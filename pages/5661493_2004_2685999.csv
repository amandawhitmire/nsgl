9,Abstract:,"The goal of this project was the determination of feasibility of single point mooring systems (SPMS) for use as deepwater ports for the import of hazardous liquid cargoes offshore southern California. The use of deepwater ports is advocated because they represent the least risky form of crude oil import, lessening the likelihood of occurrence and environmental impact severity of accidents. Two SPMS configurations were examined: catenary anchor leg mooring and single anchor leg mooring. Results indicate that SPMS for offshore southern California conditions are feasible and do not require major technological developments to allow such systems to be designed, constructed, and operated."
