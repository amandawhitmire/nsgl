12,Abstract:,"Compensatory growth (CG) in fish and other vertebrates is a period of accelerated growth that occurs upon the alleviation of stunting conditions, such as fasting or overwintering, which may occur seasonally. We have shown that CG in hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops X M. saxtilis) is characterized by hyperphagia and increased feed conversion efficiency, which collectively results in higher growth rates than individuals not subjected to adverse conditions. The response, triggered by a threshold level of catabolism, involves a host of endocrine interactions, which ultimately affect appetite, metabolism and growth. Our research in hybrid striped bass (HSB) implicates the growth regulatory hormones insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and GH along with the metabolic and appetite-​regulatory hormones leptin and ghrelin in these processes. In HSB subjected to feed restriction and/or prolonged cold-banking followed by a return to optimal rearing conditions, levels of plasma IGF-I correlated positively to growth, decreasing during catabolism and increasing dramatically during the subsequent CG response. Further, we have recently cloned the leptin coding sequence in Morone and found its expression is limited to the liver. Like plasma IGF-I, hepatic leptin mRNA declined during catabolism and recovered during the CG response. In contrast, plasma GH and ghrelin showed discordant trends to that of IGF-I and leptin, significantly increasing during catabolism and rapidly declining to control values upon CG. Furthermore, we have shown ghrelin to be a potent GH secretagogue during periods of both normal growth and catabolism, but not during periods of CG. This suggests that the ghrelin receptor may be down-regulated during periods of extreme anabolism which, when combined with declines in the ghrelin ligand itself, would promote rapid reductions in GH secretion observed during CG. Taken together, catabolic conditions prime an organism for energy intake as endogenous energy reserves are tapped, while a return to anabolic conditions directs the incoming resources toward growth. Our research suggests that these hormones orchestrate appetite modulation and activation of the growth axis that results in CG in HSB."
