11,Abstract:,"The city of Los Angeles, in conjunction with than application for a new five-year permit to discharge effluent from the Terminal Island Treatment Plant (TITP) in outer Los Angeles Harbor, requested this study on several aspects related to present and future environmental management of those wastes. These included an evaluation of the harbor's capacity to assimilate more waste, an assessment of its existing biological health, and a determination of whether a change in treating and managing fish processing waste effluents would improve the harbor's quality while assuring that the projected effluent mixtures would not be toxic. Overall, the projected effects of the city's proposed activities appear relatively benign."
