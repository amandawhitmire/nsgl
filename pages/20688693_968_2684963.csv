18,Abstract:,"Many of California’s diverse, freshwater habitats have been modified, limiting the normal movements of many residentand migratory fishes. My students, colleagues and I used physiological and behavioural approaches to study the environmentalre​quirements of native fishes that had low, or steeply declining, population sizes. Findings included swimmingmuscle ‘remodelling’ and decreases in sustained swimming performance in coho salmon as they developed towards theirsalt-water life-stage. These results, plus those on juvenile green sturgeon’s decreases in swimming performance with saltwaterreadin​ess and this species’ vulnerability to water diversions, should help natural resource managers set stream andriver standards to ensure adequate flows for preserving our natural heritage of native fishes."
