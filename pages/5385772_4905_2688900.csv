9,Abstract:,"SEM photomicrograph​s were used to assess changes in the microstructure of skipjack tuna muscle during frozen storage and thermal processing. Differences noted in frozen tissue could be related to the formation of gaps between fibers and the deformation of muscle fibers; no freeze-mediated damage to the cell wall was observed. The degree of muscle fiber shrinkage and erosion and the behavior of certain protein fractions was affected by thermal processing. Granular material, presumed to be primarily sarcoplasmic proteins, aggregated at the surface of the muscle fiber and in the interstices between the sarcolemma and the muscle fiber. The sarcomere was disrupted upon precooking."
