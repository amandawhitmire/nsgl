10,Abstract:,"In this study, the efficacy of uncloned cDNA screening was demonstrated by high resolution alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis of cDNAs of ""Haliotis rufescens"" (red abalone) intestine and gill. After further characterizatio​n, an intestine- specific cDNA identified by this procedure was shown to encode a chymotrypsin-​like preproprotease, homologous to the pancreatic serine proteases of vertebrates. Additional analyses of 11 uniform length products synthesized from anglerfish (""Lophius americanus"") pancreas and rat pancreas demonstrate that, in each case, the cDNAs are authentic, full-length transcripts complementary to tissue-specific mRNAs. Substitution of a uniform length 5'-oligo(dT) terminus in the cDNA for the heterogeneous 3'-poly(A) termini originally present in the mRNA template population imparts a band-sharpening effect on the prominent cDNA products in comparison with the diffuse bands of mRNA species, which are often undetectable within the background fluorescence of the total population of ethidium bromide-stained poly(A)+ RNA."
