8,Abstract:,"This paper describes the preliminary results of a research program on the dynamic behavior of saturated sand with fabric and fiber inclusions. Most of the existing man-made coastal and offshore fills have been constructed by dumping sand under water without compaction; such fills are usually loose and prone to liquefaction. Inclusion of geotextiles in the form of fabric in the fill can improve its resistance. The liquefaction susceptibility as a function of soil density, type and amount of geotextile inclusions, method of compaction, and confining pressure was investigated."
