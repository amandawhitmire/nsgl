16,Abstract:,"During 2016−2018, unprecedented aggregations of the colonial pelagic tunicate Pyrosoma atlanticum were observed in the Northern California Current (NCC). Pyrosomes arecommon in tropical and sub-tropical ocean waters, but little is known about their abundance, distribution,an​d trophic ecology in mid-latitude systems. To assess these factors, pyrosomes werecollected during cruises in the NCC in May and August 2017. A generalized additive model(GAM) was used to identify relationships between in situ environmental variables (temperature,sa​linity, fluorescence) and distribution and abundance patterns of pyrosomes in May 2017. Fattyacid (FA) profiles were then characterized as diet indicators, and bulk stable isotope analysis ofcarbon and nitrogen was used to examine spatial variations in potential food sources and trophiclevel. The GAM identified sea surface temperature and surface salinity as significant variablesrelate​d to pyrosome densities. The most abundant FA in the pyrosomes was docosahexanoic acid(22:6ω3), which serves in pelagic systems as a biomarker for dinoflagellates​. Common FA biomarkersfor bacteria, carnivory, and dinoflagellates differed by latitude, suggesting that pyrosomeshave different diets over a broad latitudinal range. The δ15N values of P. atlanticum indicatethat pyrosomes may be feeding at a relatively low trophic level compared to other zooplanktongrou​ps in this region. Offshore pyrosomes had lower δ13C values than those collected on the shelf,suggestin​g incorporation of nearshore carbon in pyrosome tissues. Previously documented rapidreproducti​on and growth of pyrosomes coupled with efficient feeding behavior for common NCCplankters may support their continued presence in this mid-latitude region."
