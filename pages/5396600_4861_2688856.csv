8,Abstract:,Historical literature presenting quantitative information on the interaction between nemertean brood parasites of crustaceans and their hosts is reviewed and compared with recent studies on epizootics of these parasites. Observations over the last century demonstrate that nemertean infestations on most host species are of low intensity and result in relatively low levels of host brood mortality. Epizootics discovered in the last decade on certain host species have resulted in extensive egg loss in many important commercial crustacean stocks. The data at hand suggest that epizootics are primarily restricted to commercially exploited species of decapods. One implication of this is that human exploitation affects natural host-parasite balance.
