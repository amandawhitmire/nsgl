10,Abstract:,"Despite their high visibility and lack of physical defenses against fish, crabs, and other predators, reports of predation on nudibranchs are virtually non-existent. Nudibranchs appear to employ secretions containing defensive chemicals to discourage predation. Although most nudibranchs obtain their defensive chemicals from sponges and other invertebrates on which they feed, a small group of nudibranchs synthesize their own. Among these are ""Archidoris montereyensis"" and ""A. odhneri"", both of which synthesize glyceryl esters of diterpene and sesquiterpene acids. This paper reports the isolation and identification of five diterpene glycerides from a specimen of ""Austrodoris kerguelensis"" collected in Antarctica."
