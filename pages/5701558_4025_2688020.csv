14,Abstract:,"Soft corals of the genus ""Sinularia"" are a rich source of novel terpenoids and steroids. The soft coral ""Sinularia ovispiculata"" collected on the coasts of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of the Indian Ocean was examined, and yielded two new metabolites, a diene and a triene, in addition to a handful of other known compounds."
