11,Abstract:,"Previous work has shown that the distribution of plant species in a salt marsh near Petaluma, California, is strongly influenced by the location and size of tidal channels. In this work, researchers developed and tested a simple mathematical model to measure the 'channel influence' at each point as a cumulative function based on inverse squared distance to channel, length of potentially influential channel, and channel order (a surrogate for channel cross-sectional area.) Simulations indicate that the distribution of vegetation can be described by a single, empirical factor: cumulative distance from tidal channels of different size."
