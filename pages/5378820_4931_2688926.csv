8,Abstract:,"In 1983 the National Marine Fisheries Service provided rock crab pots for experimental fishing in Humboldt Bay to cooperating fishermen in exchange for help with a bi-monthly structured survey conducted by the U.C. Cooperative Extension Sea Grant Program. This continuing 2-year survey is to determine the following: molt cycle, molt increments, size at maturity for females, `baseline' catch composition and catch rates, patterns of movement for rock crabs, and the effects of claw removal on crab survival. The purpose of this interim report is to summarize the data collected during the first year."
