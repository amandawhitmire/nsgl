10,Abstract:,"This paper examines the spatial and temporal variability of two optical properties (percent transmissivity and Secchi disk depth) measured near three areas in the Southern California Bight in which strong human influence, in the form of sewage discharge, is present. Fifteen years of data collected monthly at test and control stations were examined by time-series and other statistical analyses. By comparing the variability of these properties between the three areas (50-200 km apart) and within areas with the local discharges, researchers attempted to distinguish anthropogenicalâ€‹ly induced variability (variations associated with the local discharges) from natural variability (bightwide fluctuations). Although the results do not provide a totally unambiguous picture, they do indicate that most of the variability of these water-column properties is driven by bightwide natural phenomena."
