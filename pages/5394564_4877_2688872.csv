9,Abstract:,"Urotensin II (UII) is a dodecapeptide that has recently been described as being `partially homologous and partially analogous' to somatostatin-14 (SRIF). The `partial homology' lies in the structural similarity between UII and SRIF. The `partial analogy' rests in functional similarities between the two peptides. Recently, Sheridan et al. reported that both SRIF and UII injection into coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") results in elevated plasma free fatty acids. This paper presents evidence that SRIF and UII stimulate lipid mobilization by directly enhancing depot lipolytic enzyme activity."
