14,Abstract:,"We investigate whether consumers are willing to pay for sustainability in seafood. To do this,we estimate a logit random utility model (RUM) of seafood purchases using a product-​levelscanner dataset from a quasi-​experimental setting that includes data both before and afterthe implementation of a seafood advisory and sustainability label. Each seafood productis defined as a bundle of attributes, including price, species, and sustainability rating. Thesustainabili​ty rating is communicated to consumers through the use of a color-based trafficlight label system, where a color rating is assigned to each seafood stock-keeping unit.Combining a structural demand model with a difference-​in-​differences approach allows usto take advantage of the implementation of the labeling treatment in a subset of stores in thelocal retail chain to estimate consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for green, yellow, andred sustainability labels. We find that the addition of a yellow sustainability label negativelyimpac​ts consumer’s WTP for seafood products, however this simple average effect does notfully capture many independent underlying mechanisms, such as consumer preferences forwild-caught versus farmed products, and the color-​distribution of available labeled productswithin a species, which are empirically explored. Additional results from a second stagegeneralize​d least squares regression of RUM product fixed effects on product characteristics​indicate that consumers prefer selective harvest methods, wild caught seafood, and U.S.caught seafood."
