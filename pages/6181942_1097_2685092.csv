9,Abstract:,"By tagging and tracking fish, biologists have evaluated the site fidelities and home ranges of four of the most heavily fished, reef-associated sport fish in Southern California - California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher), kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus), barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer) and ocean whitefish (Caulolatilus princeps). The scientists' findings make it possible to predict the home ranges and habitat preferences of these species from detailed maps of benthic topography and substrate. The research also provides insights into the sizes of marine reserves needed to protect reproductively important adults and whether a given reserve's boundaries will be leaky or tight for a given species. As the Marine Life Protection Act is implemented in Southern California, the information from this project will allow managers to identify areas and sizes of marine reserves that can truly protect these target sport fish."
