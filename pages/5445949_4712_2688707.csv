8,Abstract:,"A method for predicting spatial sediment transport and yield based upon water and sediment routing was applied to simulate flood processes for a small coastal stream that drains a semi-arid watershed. The objective of the study has been to determine if the significant spatial variations in sediment transport that have been observed through field measurements could similarly be observed through the use of a mathematical model. The working hypothesis of this research is that bed-sediment transport in a small semi-arid stream during flood flows is spatially (streamwise) variable, and is subsequently manifested as stream channel storage."
