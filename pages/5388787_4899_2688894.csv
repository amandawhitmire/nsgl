12,Abstract:,"Water-soluble substances can be trapped in the aqueous interior of phospholipid vesicles (liposomes), and it has often been suggested that such structures could be used for delivery of water-soluble drugs to cells in whole organisms, including humans, as well as for lipid-based assay systems. Because of its potential applications, this is an area of intense research activity, but one of the remaining difficulties with this proposed use of liposomes is that they are not stable for long periods. It is demonstrated that when liposomes are freeze-dried in the presence of trehalose, intact liposomes are obtained following rehydration which retain most of their original contents. This leads to the possibility that liposomes may be stored for extended periods in the dehydrated state."
