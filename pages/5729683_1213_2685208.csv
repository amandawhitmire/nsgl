12,Abstract:,"Rockfish are among the most prevalent members of nearshore ichthyoplankton assemblages off central California, yet their abundance varies greatly from year to year. Warm events, like El Nino, can have pronounced effects on the success of a year class. This study evaluates distribution, abundance, and species composition of rockfish larvae on small spatial and temporal scales in the upwelling center north of Monterey Bay during an extended El Nino (December 1991 through June 1993) relative to regional hydrography. Juvenile rockfishes were extremely rare in summer of 1992; in 1993 they were twenty times more abundant and larger. It is suggested that substantially higher survival and recruitment of juvenile rockfishes in 1993 was due to increased offshore transport and perhaps lower predation during the larval stages."
