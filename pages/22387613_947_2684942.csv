23,Abstract:,"This paper is the second of two that describes the Coastal Storm Modeling System(CoSMoS) approach for quantifying physical hazards and socio-economic hazard exposure incoastal zones affected by sea-level rise and changing coastal storms. The modelling approach,presen​ted in Part 1, downscales atmospheric global-scale projections to local scale coastal floodimpacts by deterministical​ly computing the combined hazards of sea-level rise, waves, storm surges,astronom​ic tides, fluvial discharges, and changes in shoreline positions. The method is demonstratedthr​ough an application to Southern California, United States, where the shoreline is a mix ofbluffs, beaches, highly managed coastal communities, and infrastructure of high economic value.Results show that inclusion of 100-year projected coastal storms will increase flooding by 9–350%(an additional average 53.0 +/- 16.0 km2) in addition to a 25–500 cm sea-level rise. The greaterflooding extents translate to a 55–110% increase in residential impact and a 40–90% increase inbuilding replacement costs. To communicate hazards and ranges in socio-economic exposures tothese hazards, a set of tools were collaboratively designed and tested with stakeholders and policymakers; these tools consist of two web-based mapping and analytic applications as well as virtualreality visualizations. To reach a larger audience and enhance usability of the data, outreach andengagement included workshop-style trainings for targeted end-users and innovative applications ofthe virtual reality visualizations."
