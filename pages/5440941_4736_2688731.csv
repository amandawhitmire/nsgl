9,Abstract:,"Nemertean egg predators cause high egg mortality for several commercially important crustacean species. Variation in space and time as well as the interaction between these symbionts and the fishery are reviewed. A method to separate egg mortality caused by nemertean worms from other mortality sources is presented. The impact of these egg predators is discussed with respect to both individual host and population perspectives. Potential effects of nemertean egg predators are hypothesized with respect to host aggregation, molting, copulation, oviposition, breeding seasonality, burial of females during brooding, and grooming behavior."
