10,Abstract:,"The term king tide is generally used to describe the highest tides of the year. Tides are caused by the gravitational forces of the moon and the sun. Even though both the sun and moon influence our tides, the moon’s gravitational pull is about twice as strong than that of the sun. Just as we experience seasons because of our elliptical orbit around the sun, we experience different tidal forces as a result of how far away the sun, moon, and earth respectively are from each other. When the earth, moon, and sun are near alignment we get a new moon (moon between the sun and earth) and full moon (earth between the moon and sun). This alignment causes an increase in the gravitational pull roughly twice a month called ‘spring tides’. The moon’s closest position to the earth is called a ‘perigee.’ When a full or new moon coincides with perigee we get perigean spring tides. These are slightly larger tidal events that happen about three or four times a year. To broaden public awareness in an effort to bolster more stakeholder input on coastal hazards the California King Tides Project is a community science program managed by the California Coastal Commission that is focused on highlighting this coastal phenomenon. This statewide effort partners with many organizations to promote a variety of events and a unified platform for collecting photos of king tides from around California. Photos uploaded to the California King Tides Project platform can be viewed on a story map to help share how tides play out across California."
