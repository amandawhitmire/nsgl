11,Abstract:,"Golgi membranes in ""Drosophila"" embryos and tissue culture cells are found as discrete units dispersed in the cytoplasm. The author of this investigation present evidence that Golgi membranes do not undergo any dramatic change in their organization during the rapid mitotic divisions of the nuclei in the syncitial embryo or during cell division postcellularizaâ€‹tion. By contrast, in ""Drosophila"" tissue culture cells, the Golgi membranes undergo complete fragmentation during mitosis. This study shows that the mechanism of Golgi partitioning during cell division is cell type-specific."
