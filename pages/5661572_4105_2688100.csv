10,Abstract:,"There is great public demand for safe are reliable organizational performance in the maritime oil shipping industry. Researchers have identified a set of organizations and industries that operate at extremely high levels of reliability, and have labelled them High Reliability Organizations (HRO). Following the ""Exxon Valdez"" oil spill disaster of 1989, public demands for HRO-level operations were placed on the oil industry. However, despite enormous improvements in safety and reliability, maritime shipping is not operating as an HRO industry. An analysis of the organizational, environmental, and cultural history of the oil industry provides some explanation. The shortfalls maritime shipping experiences with regard to maximizing reliability are noted, and possible solutions for the achievement of HRO status are offered."
