12,Abstract:,"The authors describe a model, based on proximate considerations, for salmonid life histories, focused on Atlantic salmon. The model involves identification of the times at which developmental conversions are initiated or inhibited and the connection between physiological state and the thresholds for such conversions. The states of the fish and rate of change of state are determined by environmental opportunity, but the threshold is genetic. This approach immediately generates a genotype-â€‹environment interaction. The theory generates fitness surfaces for different life histories, so that variation is inherent in this approach."
