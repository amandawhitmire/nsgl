11,Abstract:,"Here toxicologists investigate withering syndrome in red abalone ""Haliotis rufescens"", an important wild and farmed shellfish species, using a metabolomic approach that combines the metabolic profiling capabilities of NMR spectroscopy with pattern recognition methods. Foot muscle, digestive gland, and hemolymph samples were collected from healthy, stunted, and diseased abalone, and the extracts were analyzed by NMR. Results confirm that NMR-based metabolomics can successfully distinguish the biochemical profiles of the three groups of animals, in every type of tissue or biofluid studied. Furthermore, this approach successfully identified novel metabolic biomarker profiles associated with withering syndrome. The application of these methods for investigating other environmental stressors is discussed, as are the advantages of NMR-based metabolomics for biomonitoring, particularly in conjunction with gene and protein expression profiling."
