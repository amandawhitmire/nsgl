10,Abstract:,"The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, taken together, comprise the largest port complex in the nation, handling fully fifty percent more containerized cargo in 1987 than their nearest competitor, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Even as they set new records for U.S. cargo handling, they are preparing for a massive new round of port expansion. The two ports intend to spend almost $4.8 billion to expand and upgrade their facilities by the year 2020, following a long-range effort called the `2020 Plan'. This article offers background information and an analysis of the problems and issues that are likely to arise from the plans to expand the two ports. It describes the alternative expansion plans, the planned `consolidated transportation corridor,' and the other concerns and questions confronting the port authorities as they contemplate expansion plans."
