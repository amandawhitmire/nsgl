10,Abstract:,"This experimental study focused on examining the performance of an electro-​magneto-​hydrodynamic (EMHD) actuator in separation control in a weakly conductive fluid. An actuator comprising of an array of alternately arranged electrodes and magnets was flush mounted on the surface of a 2-D hydrofoil model with a trailing flap inclined at 20 degrees to the freestream flow in a water tunnel. The actuator was powered with a unipolar square wave at different values of frequency and amplitude, generating time-periodic, spanwise Lorentz forces in an attempt to suppress separation of the boundary layer on the model at the flap. Velocity fields measured using ""Particle Image Velocimetry"" indicated complete flow reattachment due to application of Lorentz forces above a certain forcing amplitude. The performance of the actuator was seen to be weakly dependent on actuation frequency, with improved performance recorded at a non-dimensional frequency of unity."
