10,Abstract:,"Because of precipitous declines in California abalone populations (largely as a result of fishing pressure and disease), farmed seed abalone have been planted in an attempt to research and restore dwindling populations. Withering syndrome (WS) is a chronic disease responsible for mass mortalities of wild abalone in southern and central California and is caused by the bacterium '""Candidatus"" Xenohaliotis californiensis.â€‹' This bacterium has been observed in farmed red abalone throughout the state. In an effort to elucidate the distribution and source of the bacterium in northern California, the presence or absence of the disease and bacterium was verified at 15 locations north of Carmel. This research revealed that both the bacterium and WS are present in abalone populations south of San Francisco. In addition, the bacterium (but not WS) is present at two locations in northern California, both associated with outplants of hatchery-reared abalone, suggesting a link between restoration efforts and the present distribution of this pathogen. These data highlight the need for careful assessment of animal health before restocking depleted populations."
