9,Abstract:,"Spoilage begins as soon as seafood species die. Their normal defense mechanisms stop working and a series of changes begin that cause spoilage. These changes are caused by bacteria, enzymes and chemical action. If food poisoning bacteria are present, they can multiply and cause illness when the seafood is eaten. This brochure delivers a number of unsavory details of concern to both supplier and consumer."
