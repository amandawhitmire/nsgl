9,Abstract:,"Along the southern California coast there are few opportunities to create new wetlands; hence, mitigators often propose to remodel existing wetlands to achieve greater 'value' rather than offering to create new habitat. Restoration and/or mitigation plans have been proposed for about half the region's 29 coastal wetland systems, with debate over which objectives can be met and little ability to predict the cumulative result. Knowledge of the dilemma in southern California may help other regions avoid similar problems by developing realistic approaches to habitat protection and restructuring before too much of the resource is lost."
