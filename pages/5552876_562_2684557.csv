11,Abstract:,"California has a large and diverse marine recreational fishery; anglers on commercial passenger-​carrying fishing vessels harvest about 40% and 16% of total recreational catch in southern and northern California, respectively. Traditionally targeted species in central and northern California include Pacific salmon, striped bass, rockfishes, lingcod and white sturgeon. The subtropical waters off southern California are fished for albacore, bonito, yellowtail, barracuda, and chub mackerel. Fleet declines in recent years have been attributed to reduced fish abundance and availability, high costs, and competition with other activities. This project gathered data on vessel owners' and anglers' demographics, information sources, decisionmaking behavior, and perceptions; strategies for improvement based on survey results are recommended."
