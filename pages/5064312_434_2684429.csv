10,Abstract:,"New and evolving industries like marine aquaculture must compete for coastal locations along with the myriad of traditional coastal zone uses. Unfortunately, ​ information regarding aquaculture as an industry is not readily available. In addition to just basic information about aquaculture as an industry, little is known about the issues and policy considerations confronting its development. This technical report traces the historical development of marine aquaculture in California. Included is background information on the industry's present and potential contribution to the state as a food source and economic activity. This information is further analyzed within the context of the issues that are facing marine aquaculture as a coastal dependent activity. Consequently, this report should be of interest to coastal planners, managers, and decision makers charged with formulating and implementing coastal policy. Because of the numerous requests received from other jurisdictions and interested groups, the California MAP decided to publish this work as a technical assistance report. It is our belief that materials and information contained within this report are transferable to other jurisdictions that must deal with aquaculture and coastal zone planning."
