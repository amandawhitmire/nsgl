11,Abstract:,"This research is focused on understanding cohesive sediment dynamics and transport in a partially-‚Äãstratified estuary, the San Francisco Bay-Delta (SFBD) estuary.Cohesiv‚Äãe sediments play an essential role in coastal systems because they act as carriers for contaminant transport, affect aquatic organisms through turbidity, and cause build-up in navigation channels. One of the fundamental challenges in the study of this multifaceted chemical, biological, and physical problem is the dynamic process of cohesive sediment flocculation.Wh‚Äãile numerous studies have examined fluid-sediment interactions in coastal systems like the SFBD estuary, relatively few studies have considered flocculation effects. More specifically, the effect of stratified turbulence on flocculation dynamics can be important but their interactions are not well observed and many fundamental questions remain to be addressed. The goal of this dissertation is to address these gaps by 1)improving sediment concentration sensor calibration; 2) characterizing cohesive sediment properties; 3) quantifying the effect of selected water properties on cohesive sediment flocculation; 4) quantifying the influence of the hydrodynamic processes on cohesive sediment flocculation; and 5) investigating the links between flocculation and light penetration. While this investigation is primarily focused on the dynamics in the SFBD estuary, we expect that our approach and analysis are sufficiently general to provide insights into the underlying physical processes.In order to achieve these five aims, three datasets were collected using traditional and state-‚Äãof-‚Äãthe-‚Äãart instruments: 1) USGS transects: seven longitudinal transects collected on the R/V Polaris in collaboration with the USGS SFB monthly water monitoring project; 2) EVP transects: two two-day transects collected on the R/V Questuary spanning from Suisun Bay to the Delta, near Sacramento, CA; and 3) EVP stationary: a48-hr stationary profiling experiment collected on the R/V Questuary at the low-salinity zone in Rio Vista, CA. Altogether, these experiments covered a spatial range ofapproximately 220 km from June 2008 to November 2015. Vertical profiles of particle size distributions, total floc volume concentrations, pressure, salinity, temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, organic content percentage, total suspended solids concentrations (TSS via optical backscatter calibration), and photosynthetica‚Äãlly active radiation were collected in all experiments using a LISST-100X Type B or Type C(Sequoia Scientific) and a SBE 19+ CTD (Sea-Bird Electronics). Background currents were monitored using a downward-‚Äãlooking 600 or 1200 kHz ADCP (Teledyne RDI) on all the EVP datasets, and in-situ dissipation profiles were measured using a free-‚ÄãfallingVMP-‚Äã200 (Rockland Scientific) in all the datasets except for one USGS transect. Discrete in-water and bottom sediment samples were also collected to determine the inorganic particle size and sediment concentration. These different cohesive sediment instruments collectively covered a particle size range from 0.017 Œºm to 2 mm.Using a combination of laboratory, field, and theoretical methods in the data processing, we make the following main observations. First, we compared traditional and novel sediment concentration sensor calibration methods and we showed that both the laser diffraction and optical backscatter method produced comparable and reliable results.Even though the laser diffraction method accounted for the effects of flocculation, its performance was not significantly better than the traditional optical backscatter method since the magnitude of the suspended particulates is a first order effect. Second, we characterized the disaggregated and flocculated cohesive sediment properties in theSFBD estuary and we showed that the expected floc fall velocity is on the ùëÇ(0.01 ‚àí 1)mm/s. This is at least an order of magnitude higher than the expected fall velocity of their primary constituents. Third, we showed that the floc median diameter (ùëë50) is either not significantly or is only weakly affected by changes in salinity, sediment concentration, and biological activity. Since the laser diffraction measurements can be compromised in the presence of strong stratification, assessments using accepted schlieren-based thresholds did not significantly improve these correlations.Fo‚Äãurth, we showed that the physical processes had the strongest influence on ùëë50.Over tidal timescales, the smallest floc sizes are typically observed during slack water, and the largest floc sizes are typically observed at peak current velocities. Like many previous field studies, we confirmed that the turbulent shear rate (ùê∫) is the primary control on floc size changes in time. While smaller in magnitude, we also showed that processes such as differential settling can be important, especially during slack water.Different‚Äãial settling has often been overlooked in previous laboratory and field observations of flocculation, but our high-resolution vertical measurements showed that this process sets up a vertical gradient in floc size distributions. These deviations in the vertical affect the reliability of ùê∫ as the best predictor of ùëë50. In fact, we found that the velocity magnitude, rather than ùê∫ itself, is a better predictor of ùëë50 in some instances.The velocity magnitude was able to capture both the vertical and temporal variations inùëë50. Lastly, the effects of stratification on the turbulence (and hence ùê∫) estimates were also assessed using several advanced field methods, and we showed that the stratified turbulence will only slightly modify the magnitude of ùê∫, but it will not change the overall trends between ùê∫ and ùëë50.Fifth, we show that suspended sediment and light penetration relationships can be improved by accounting for floc size changes under certain conditions. Similar to the sediment concentration sensor calibration analysis, the magnitude of the suspended particulates has a first order effect on light penetration, but we found that floc-based sediment proxies (e.g., total cross-sectional area of the flocs) yielded moderately better predictions than the traditional turbidity-based sediment concentration.O‚Äãverall, we believe that the findings presented in this dissertation can be used inthe context of improving field, analytical, and numerical investigations of cohesive sediment dynamics in the SFBD estuary and beyond. As flocculation remains a key aspect in many natural and engineered systems, this dissertation represents a step towards unraveling the complex balance between the chemical, biological, and physical controls on flocculation dynamics in estuarine environments."
