14,Abstract:,"Originally prepared for the California legislature in 1971, CALIFORNIA'S LIVING MARINE RESOURCES AND THEIR UTILIZATION proved to be one of the most valuable general reference works available on California's economically important marine species. Over the years it has been widely used by fisheries researchers and managers, policymakers, enforcement officers, the fishing industry, and educators. Public concern with the environmental effects of increased pressures on marine resources has grown tremendously. Legislation concerning marine mammals, coastal and offshore development, pollution, and endangered species strongly affects marine resource management today. These changes suggest that this revised book is needed and perhaps overdue. Following each section, there is a short list of general references for further reading. Detailed fish and shellfish landings statistics are found in appendices."
