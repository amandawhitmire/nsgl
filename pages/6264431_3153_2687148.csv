16,Abstract:,"During the main phase of growth, oocytes accumulate vitellogenins (Vtgs), members of a family of lipoprotein yolk precursors. In Acanthomorph teleosts, a pair of paralogous complete Vtgs (VtgAa and VtgAb) contain five linear yolk protein (YP) domains from the NH2-terminus: lipovitellin (Lv) heavy chain (LvH), phosvitin (Pv), Lv light chain (LvL), b'-component (b'-c), and C-terminal component (Ct). The Vtgs are secreted by the liver in response to estrogen (E2) and are taken up by growing oocytes via endocytosis mediated by specific membrane receptors. Following uptake, complete Vtgs are cleaved into different YP classes (Lv, Pv, various Lv-Pv complexes, b'-c and Ct) by cathepsin D and stored as yolk. During oocyte maturation (OM) an additional proteolysis of these Vtg-derived YPs occurs, whereby most YPs including LvH from VtgAa are degraded into free amino acids (FAAs) by one or more other cathepsins; however, the main YP derived from VtgAb (LvHAb) remains largely intact. This second YP proteolysis requires the acidification of the yolk vesicles, which activates the cathepsin zymogens. The disparate processing of YPs derived from the different complete Vtgs is relevant to egg and larval quality because: 1) VtgAa-derived FAAs generate an osmotic gradient that drives oocyte hydration and adjusts egg buoyancy and the FAAs also act as diffusible nutrients for early embryos; 2) the LvH derived from VtgAb remains as a large lipoprotein selectively utilized by late-stage larvae; and 3) the coordinated ratio of VtgAa to VtgAb accumulated during oocyte assembly determines the proportional availability of yolk components required for these processes and may permit adjustment of egg buoyancy to different environmental salinities. We discovered that regulation of the relative amounts of YPs derived from VtgAa versus VtgAb occurs at the level of hepatic secretion and also at the level of oocyte uptake. The VtgAa/VtgAb ratio in the liver does not match that in the bloodstream and the amounts of YPs derived from each form of Vtg that are accumulated in oocytes differs from what would be predicted by the blood VtgAa and VtgAb levels. We also have discovered distinct oocyte receptors (Vtgrs) for these two Vtgs (VtgrAa and VtgrAb), which may direct the different forms of Vtg into discrete populations of endosomes exhibiting different degrees of acidification, cathepsin activation, and YP degradation during OM. No other explanation of the disparate proteolysis of the two types of Vtg, which are structurally very similar, is apparent. A third type of incomplete Vtg, which lacks or has severely reduced Pv, b'-c, and Ct domains (VtgC) is widely present in teleosts and usually makes a minor contribution to the yolk. The VtgC has no specific oocyte receptor and is not usually cleaved into product YPs during oocyte growth or OM. Its synthesis appears to be less dependent on, and less sensitive to, E2 induction and it begins to accumulate in oocytes much earlier than do the complete Vtgs. The VtgC may provide a mechanism for enriching the supply of large lipoprotein nutrients to late-stage larvae without altering the osmotic balance of oocytes or eggs."
