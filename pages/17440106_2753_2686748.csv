9,Abstract:,"Grape farmers worldwide have voluntarily adopted controls on water flow through vineyards and other sustainability ​ practices because they want to conserve water and protect water quality, minimize erosion, reduce pesticide risks, protect worker safety and conserve wildlife habitat. Grape farmers in California, Washington, Oregon, New York, Michigan and New Zealand have been participating in programs that protect the environment and maintain production of high-​quality grapes. Some have been using these practices since the 1990s. And now grape growers in Pennsylvania’s Lake Erie basin can participate in VinES (Vested in Environmental Sustainability)​. “The Pennsylvania program was created to give county, state and federal agencies new opportunities to partner with local grape growers in an effort to increase the profitability of their agricultural operations and reduce non-​point source pollution from entering into Lake Erie and our waterways,” said Tim Bruno, chief of the Office of the Great Lakes for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Interstate Waters Office."
