9,Abstract:,"Native to Japan, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is a major component of the U.S. shellfish industry, hailed asWashington's most valuable bivalve. NOAA estimates that from 1984 to 2005, oyster farming generated approximately $96.2 million annually (not limited to the Pacific oyster). However, a common oyster disease, summer mortality syndrome (SMS), has been known to destroy more than half (52% to 63%) of a farm's expected annual harvest. Though this disease first appeared in Japan in the 1950s, it later spread to North America and Europe, creating serious problems for growers. Combating the disease could save oyster growers, here and abroad, millions of dollars annually. In this project, the biologist sought to investigate the causes of SMS in Pacific oysters. His goal was to identify possible links between SMS and gene expression patterns by collecting fluid samples from oysters in the summer. He also observed how the oysters were affected by higher water temperatures and full vs. partial submersion."
