10,Abstract:,"Toxicity tests with larval marine organisms are widely used as water quality-​monitoring tools. Developmental tests using larvae of red abalone (""Haliotis rufescens"") are currently mandated by the State of California for use by effluent producers. The biochemical actions of these effluents in larvae are generally unknown. It was the goal of this investigation to adopt ""in vivo"" 31P-NMR techniques for use with abalone veligers (a free-swimming early life stage) to describe the sublethal actions of pentacholorophe​nol, an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation​."
