10,Abstract:,"The effects of eyestalk ablation, regeneration, and rearing condition on the size of new cuticles before and after expansion were studied in juvenile ""Homarus americanus"". Both eyestalk- ablated and intact lobster grew larger in large spaces than in small spaces. In contrast, regeneration reducted molt increment. Despite large differences in molt increment among experimental groups, the percentage of postmolt size increase that could be accounted for by unfolding of the new cuticle was large and constant in each group. In addition, transferring freshly molted lobster to dilute seawater did not produce any further size increase but instead caused cuticle breakage in some animals. It is concluded that molt increment in lobster is determined by regulating the size of the cuticle before ecdysis. The size of the postmolt cuticle is primarily a result of unfolding of the new, previously folded cuticle."
