14,Abstract:,"This report presents data from several experiments which suggest possible factors affecting hepatic growth hormones (GH) receptor levels in coho salmon. Effects of GH, thyroxine (T4), cortisol, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and fasting on GH binding were examined. Inasmuch as fasting decreased hepatic GH binding, nutritional state as well as endogenous hormones may contribute to GH responsiveness in this teleost."
