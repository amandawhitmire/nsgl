10,Abstract:,"Early chemical investigations of ""Eunicea"" species, beginning in the early 1960s, showed these animals to be a chemically complex resource for cembrene lactones. More recent studies have shown that this gorgonian genus produces a wider diversity of secondary metabolites. Seven new diterpenoids of the cubitane and cembrane classes have been isolated from the Caribbean sea whip ""Eunicea calyculata"". The first photochemical transformation of a cembrene to a cubitene diterpenoid is reported."
