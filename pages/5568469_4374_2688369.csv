11,Abstract:,"Although the entropically driven association of the hydrocarbons in membrane phospholipids to form bilayers is dominated to a great extent by the hydrocarbons, the phase properties of the lipids are altered in important ways by the presence of water or other molecules in association with the polar head groups. These effects on phase properties have consequences for membrane structure and function. For instance, when water is removed from a biological membrane, irreversible changes in structural and functional integrity result. The loss of biological integrity that accompanies dehydration of a membrane can be ascribed directly to effects of hydration on phase behavior of membrane phospholipids. This review describes what is known about such effects and how they are related to biological properties of membranes."
