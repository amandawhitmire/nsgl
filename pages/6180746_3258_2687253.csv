9,Abstract:,"New Coastal and Marine Institute Lab supports research on compromised marine habitat Tokyo has the Pacific, San Francisco hugs the bay that shares its name and Paris nestles against the banks of the Seine. It's no coincidence that some of the largest and most vibrant urban areas are built along the water. Since the first civilizations, communities have thrived where water provides easy access to trade, an ample source of food and scenic recreation spots. But while water is conducive to urbanization, urbanization is detrimental to marine health. Pollution, overfishing and other human factors threaten the waters supporting these metropolises."
