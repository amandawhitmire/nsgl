14,Abstract:,"This assessment reports the status of the Longnose Skate (Beringraja rhina) resource off the coast of the United States from Southern California to the U.S. - Canadian border using data through 2018. The species is modeled as a single stock, as there is currently no biological and genetic data supporting the presence of multiple stocks within the assessment region. The assessed period begins in 1916, when skate catch started to first appear in fisheries records, with the assumption that previously the stock was in an unfished equilibrium condition. Types of data that inform the model include catch, length and age frequency data from commercial and tribal fishing fleets. Commercial fishery data are divided among three coastwide fleets, which include the current fishery (1995-present), historical landings and historical discard. Fishery-​dependent biological data used in the assessment originated from both port-based and on-board observer sampling programs. Relative biomass indices and information from biological sampling from four bottom trawl surveys were included; these trawl surveys were conducted by the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) and the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Longnose Skate catch in the International Pacific Halibut Commission’s (IPHC’s) long-line survey is also included via an index of relative abundance; IPHC length frequency data are used."
