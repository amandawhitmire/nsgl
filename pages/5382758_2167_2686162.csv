9,Abstract:,"The fertilized sea urchin egg has shown a significant degree of utility both as an experimental model for investigating mechanisms of drug action and as a selective screen that appears relatively insensitive to several classes of antineoplastic agents. This degree of selectivity afforded the opportunity to identify several new classes of cell division inhibitors from marine sources that appear to be exerting their effects by novel mechanisms of action. Described here are details of this assay, as well as an overview of the results one can obtain. References to literature with more detailed descriptions of the results of this experimental model are included."
