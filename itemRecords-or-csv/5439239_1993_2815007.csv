11,Abstract:,"Much of the mortality in salmonid populations is believed to occur in the period when they first enter the sea. Food limitation may affect early ocean survival, either directly through starvation or indirectly through decreased growth rates making slow-growing fish more vulnerable to size-selective predation. The purpose of this study is to describe and quantify the diel cycle of feeding in field-caught specimens and use these consumption rates, together with the rate of gastric evacuation measured in the laboratory, to estimate the daily ration of juvenile coho salmon in the marine environment."
