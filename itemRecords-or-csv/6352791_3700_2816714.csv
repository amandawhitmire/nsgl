15,Abstract:,"Koi Herpes Virus (KHV) has been classified recently as a member of the Alloherpesvirid​ae within the Herpesvirales order (Waltzek et al., 2005). Although one of the unique features of Herpesviridae, the sister family of Herpesvirales, is latent infection, it has not been demonstrated consistently that KHV of Alloherpesvirid​ae can cause latent infection and be reactivated from latency. To investigate if KHV genomic DNA is present in koi exposed to KHV infection, 10 healthy fish were investigated from a koi population with a history of a KHV outbreak. No gross lesions or microscopic changes were observed at necropsy or by histological examination. No infectious virus was isolated from either the blood plasma or tissues. However, KHV DNA was detected in the white blood cells of nine of the ten fish by real-time PCR and PCR-Southern blot. KHV DNA was also detected in the brain, eye, spleen, gills hematopoietic kidney, trunk kidney, and intestine of nine of the ten fish by PCR-Southern blot. Interestingly, KHV DNA was also detected in the intestinal contents from seven of ten koi. Portions of major capsid gene DNA, amplified from two of the ten koi WBCs, were found to be identical to KHV-U. This study demonstrated that KHV genomic DNA can be detected in normal koi exposed previously to KHV and suggests that KHV becomes latent in fish."
