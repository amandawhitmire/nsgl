12,Abstract:,"Two hundred sixty-three razor clams were collected from two beaches in Oregon. Gill tissue was examined for the presence of an unclassified parasite that has been termed nuclear inclusion X, or NIX. All of the Clatsop Beach razor clams were infected, and 91.7% of the Agate Beach clams were; the average intensity of infection (parasites per field) was lower at Agate Beach. The origin of the parasite and the history of its association with razor clams are unknown."
