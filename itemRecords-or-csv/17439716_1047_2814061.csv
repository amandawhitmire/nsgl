13,Abstract:,"This reference guide is intended as a resource for anyone interested in connecting science producers with science users. Engagement facilitators can use this guide to learn about the practice of scientist– stakeholder collaborations across disciplines and gain insights into the lessons learned through collaboration. The guide is also appropriate for agency practitioners and principal investigators researching the broader impacts of collaborative science, for example via grants from the National Science Foundation, NOAA, the national Sea Grant network, or others."
