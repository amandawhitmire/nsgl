12,Abstract:,"Collections of the marine cyanobacterium ""Lyngbya majuscula"" from various Pacific locations have yielded a wide variety of novel lipids, many of which show interesting biological properties. Hence, as part of a survey of seaweed chemistry from Puerto Rico in the Caribbean, the authors examined and contrasted the chemistry of this species of blue-green with that of Pacific collections. From both very shallow water and deeper water collections they have found Caribbean ""L. majuscula"" to contain chlorine-​containing amides of a previosly reported methoxylated fatty acid. Additionally, one of the collections contained substantial amounts of the methoxylated fatty acid in its free acid form as well as elemental sulphur."
