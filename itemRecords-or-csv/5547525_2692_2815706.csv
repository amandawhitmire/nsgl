15,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus associated with severe epizootic disease in juvenile salmonid fish. The aquaculture industry is looking for advances in recombinant DNA technology to provide economical and effective vaccines. Bacterial lysates containing ""trpE""-G fusion proteins induced protective immunity against IHNV in laboratory trials and led to the development of a prototype vaccine. Despite the efficacy of the vaccine in laboratory trials, there still remained questions concerning the number of immunoprotectiv​e regions on the G protein and the identification of those regions recognized in fish. The construction of cones and the characterizatio​n of the epitopes of their expressed fusion proteins are described here in an analysis of the antigenic nature of the IHNV G protein."
