9,Abstract:,"The marine and freshwater fishery resources of West Africa are some of the most productive in the world, and hold vast potential to provide economic prosperity and food security for the developing nations of that region. Nevertheless, the realized social benefits from fishery resources to West African nations have fallen far short of target levels. Many factors contribute to the failed realization of these potential resource benefits. Inadequate management capacity and lack of infrastructure for educating effective fisheries managers have been identified as key challenges to achieving sustainable and profitable fisheries in this region. This project evaluates the potential for expanding the existing Oregon State University Fisheries Management Certificate to universities and fisheries management agencies in Africa as a capacity building initiative. A training needs assessment was conducted by surveying African fisheries management experts. Specific knowledge, skill and ability needs were identified along with existing technological and institutional barriers to the effective delivery of this curriculum through an online distance education program. Preparedness among African fish managers for the specific competencies currently provided through the program was evaluated. This report provides recommendations to OSU's E-campus program for next steps in expanding the Fisheries Management Certificate to Africa, as well as informing future efforts at developing training programs for fisheries management in Africa."
