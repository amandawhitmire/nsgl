11,Abstract:,"Effects of salt concentrations and washing cycles on the extraction of proteins were evaluated. Sarcoplasmic proteins were readily soluble in water and removed in the initial washing steps. Myofibrillar proteins became relatively soluble and were lost during extensive washing. Control of water/meat ratio, washing time, and washing cycles was critical in reducing the loss of myofibrillar proteins. Washing with dilute NaCl sloutions reduced the loss of myofibrillar proteins. However, these solutions were not very effective in removing sarcoplasmic proteins even with increased washing cycles. High salt (2.0% NaCl) washing resulted in low removal of sarcoplasmic proteins and severe loss of myofibrillar proteins."
