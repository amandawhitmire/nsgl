14,Abstract:,"Helping coastal communities prepare for climate change is a vital concern, as they face potentially significant effects of climate variability during this century. While decision makers may want trusted information on the effects of climate change, and Sea Grant may be a vehicle for providing information support, important questions remain regarding the factors that influence the use of climate information. Our project--a NOAA funded partnership of various Sea Grant states including Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, Minnesota, Washington, and Oregon--has sought to develop and facilitate local knowledge-​action networks that assist coastal decision makers with decision-​relevant information about climate variability and change. Our ongoing work incorporates methodology addressing risk and uncertainty, based on the risk communication model developed by Morgan and colleagues (Morgan, M. Granger, Fischhoff et al. 2002). This risk communication model derives from decision research and a ""nonpersuasive"" method of communicating. The process of creating expert models, developing interview protocols, conducting mental model interviews, analyzing and using results will be described. The poster will share the lessons learned in introducing this new procedure to numerous practitioners, the limitations and successes, as well as innovations to the method based on our project's outcomes, which include helpi"
