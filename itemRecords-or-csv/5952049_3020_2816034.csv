11,Abstract:,"This paper is eicosanoids in nonmammals in a chapter in the first volume (""Polyketides and Other Secondary Metabolites Including Fatty Acids and Their Derivates"") of ""Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry"". Although eicosanoids and related compounds are best known for their important roles in mammalian physiology and disease, they occur in such diverse creatures as bacteria, marine algae, and invertebrate animals, as well as in terrestrial higher plants. These eicosaoid-like structures vary in chain length, oxidation pattern, cyclization pattern, and the type of incorporated heteroatoms. Because of the nature of eiconsanoid-â€‹like compounds found in nonmammals, the author uses a somewhat expanded definition of ""eicosanoid."" Specifically, he discusses polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of any chain length that are metabolized to distinct structures. The chapter is organized along strictly taxonomic lines. It begins with the most primitive group, the bacteria, including cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). The bacteria are followed by the primitive eukaryotes, fungi and yeasts, and then algae, predominately the macrophytic marine algae. After that, the author reviews the oxylipins of higher plants, arranged along familial lines; animal oxylipins, arranged sequentially and beginning with fish; and then marine invertebrates, insects, amphibians, arachnids, and worms. Space limitations meant that discussion of newer examples of oxylipins is given precedence over old, oxylipins illustrated trends over those representing exceptions, and structurally complex oxylipins over those of more straightforward structure. When biosynthetic investigation of a particular oxylipin structure class has advanced notably using a particular species, then this species has been chosen as the representative example."
