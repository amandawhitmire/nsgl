10,Abstract:,"The Toledo Edison Company operates two fossil fuel electric power generating stations on the Maumee River in northwestern Ohio. The Bayshore plant is located in the city of Oregon, near the mouth of the river and the Acme plant is located in Toledo approximately 5 miles upstream. Both plants are sited on the east shore of the Maumee River and both draw cooling water from this stream. The cooling water intake at the Bayshore facility consists of a channel 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) long and 250 feet (76 meters) wide, which extends in a southeasterly direction from the river mouth to the plant located on the shore of Maumee Bay. The Bayshore facility uses eight circulating water pumps (approximately 65,020 gpm each) to draw cooling water through this channel to the plant at a maximum rate of 520,138 gpm. this rate of pumping would allow the plant to empty its intake channel every 4.26 hours or 5.64 times a day. The heated cooling water is released directly into Maumee Bay through a narrow discharge channel. The Acme plant is 500 feet (152.4 meters) from the Maumee River and utilizes a narrow concrete intake structure, whic his set perpendicular to the shoreline. The maximum pumping rate at the Acme facility is 275,694 gpm. The thermal discharge from the plant enters the river a short distance downstream. Excessive accumulations of fish in the intake channels have been reported by plant officials. At certain periods of the year these accumulations interfere with the free flow of cooling water into the plants and have an adverse effect on plant operation. Typically these accumulations accur in the late fall and winter with the greatest density in December and January. The purpose of this study was to investigate excessive fish impingement upon the electric power plant intake structures on the lower Maumee River. The species and quantity of fish involved and the physical, chemical and biological parameters of the environment which affect the movement of fish into these structures were also to be determined."
