14,Abstract:,"Pacific whiting can be processed into high quality surimi, having the ability to produce strong and cohesive gels with the use of protease inhibitors. A major drawback for whiting surimi production on the U.S. west coast is the seasonal availability of Pacific whiting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of producting acceptable surimi from frozen stabilized mince (SM) prepared with cryoprotectant mixtures with varying levels of sucrose, ranging from 12 to 6% (w/w). Texture parameters and yield estimates of surimi made from SM were compared with surimi made from freshly minced fillets."
