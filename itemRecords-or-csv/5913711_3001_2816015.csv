13,Abstract:,"Previous work with high-pressure processing (HPP) and oysters has shown that this treatment is effective in reducing the total bacterial load in shucked oysters. In addition, preliminary work has indicated that the treatment could be used for the mechanical shucking of oysters. One objective of this study was to determine the optimum HPP conditions (time/pressure) for the processing of fresh shell oysters to facilitate shucking. The second objective was to determine the effect of pressure on shelf life of refrigerated oyster meats."
