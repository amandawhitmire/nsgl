9,Abstract:,"A new iPhone application gives visitors an inside look at Oregon's newest state park, the Beaver Creek State Natural Area south of Newport. The application, ""Paddle Beaver Creek,"" was developed jointly by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department and Oregon Sea Grant. The core of the application is an interactive map of the Beaver Creek Water Trail -- about three scenic miles of an easy-paddling waterway in a pristine coastal marsh open to kayaks and canoes. With no feasible way to post interpretive signs along a water trail, the application provides iPhone-equipped canoeists and kayakers a way to track their progress via GPS, and interactively highlights points of interest along the way, from nesting ospreys to beaver lodges. The application is available free for downloading from the iPhone store. Free wifi access allows visitors to download the application on the spot."
