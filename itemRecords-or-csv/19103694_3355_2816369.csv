10,Abstract:,"Use the comprehensive species module here for an in-depth understanding of the Chinese mitten crab. Modules include a comprehensive species guide, a species-​at-​a-​glance fact sheet, a related lesson plan, suggested activies, comprehension questions, and videos and related on-line resources.The Chinese mitten crab was first identified in the south San Francisco Bay in 1992 by commercial shrimp trawlers, and quickly spread to the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The Chinese mitten crab threatens ecosystems, earthen structures, and fisheries by preying on and competing with many species, including fish eggs, clams, and mussels; and by eroding riverbanks, wetland edges, and levees."
