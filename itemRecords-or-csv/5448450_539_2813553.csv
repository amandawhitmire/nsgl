12,Abstract:,"This paper responds to a request of the Port of Newport and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for answers to the following questions concerning the proposed South Beach Moorage Project on Yaquina Bay at Newport, Oregon: 1. What is the probable demand for South Beach moorage space at rates required to cover the annual costs of the new facilities? 2. How many years ahead of demand should the Port and Corps build moorage capacity? 3. What size area should the Corps dredge and protect by a breakwater? 4. What size moorage facilities( i.e., docks) should the Port initially construct?"
