13,Abstract:,"This poster describes how Oregon State University staff, with partners in the Oregon Coast Regional STEM Center, received funding from NOAAâ€™s Marine Debris Program to leverage existing partnerships to develop an integrated STEAMSS curriculum that educates 4th through 12th grade students about the causes and impacts of marine debris and empowers them to make a difference in their communities. The curriculum focuses on the connectivity of all watersheds to the ocean, and how the students will gain a greater understanding of the origins and distribution of marine debris as they participate in activities such as designing, launching, and tracking biodegradable drifters, and the collection and analysis of debris from schoolyards to beaches."
