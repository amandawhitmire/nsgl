12,Abstract:,"The objective of this study is to examine in detail the relationship between a sediment grain's threshold condition and its settling velocity. The forces involved in grain threshold are examined by means of a grain-pivoting analysis and how the resulting equations can be interpreted to relate the threshold of a grain to its settling velocity is discussed. Study results provide a better understanding of the forces involved in grain entrainment, and also permit direct evaluations of a grain's threshold from its measured settling velocity."
