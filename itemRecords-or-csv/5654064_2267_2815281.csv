12,Abstract:,"English soles ""Pleuronectes vetulus"" utilize the Yaquina Bay, Oregon, estuary as a nursery ground for their first year of life. During this time, they often have a low-level infection of the monogenetic trematode ""Gyrodactylus stellatus"". In this study, the progress of a trematode infection in English soles was followed to determine if there were factors in the serum and in the mucus that had detrimental effects on live ""G. stellatus"" (i.e., possible resistance factors), and if so, to determine if there was a relationship between the presence of these factors and the level of infection. This was accomplished with bioassays that tested for differences in the length of survival of ""G. stellatus"" exposed to serum and mucous samples collected from English soles throughout a laboratory epizootic."
