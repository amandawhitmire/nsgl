10,Abstract:,"The information about ecosystems worldwide provided at this symposium will aid in multispecies management in Alaska and elsewhere. Forage fishes are of particular concern in Alaska because lack of these prey fishes is most likely the cause of a dramatic decline in Steller sea lions, fur seals, and seabirds in the past 20 years. The symposium was organized around several themes: fish biology, their role as predators and prey, causes of population fluctuations, assessment methods, and management. Fifty-six research contributions are included in the book, plus a workshop report, and a 33- page summary which includes indexes to the book by predator and prey species."
