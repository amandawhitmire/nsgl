13,Abstract:,"This five-lesson high school curriculum seeks to increase student understanding about ocean acidification and help them understand that it is an issue they can address. There are five lessons in the unit and a final Call to  Action project. Lesson 1 begins by exploring a real-life story of the near collapse of the oyster industry that occurred from 2007 to 2009 along the U.S. west coast. The lesson continues with an overview of OA and exploration of how humans have altered the carbon cycle. Lessons 2 and 3 focus on the chemistry of OA. In Lesson 2, students focus on pH and how carbon dioxide “acidifies” water. In Lesson 3, students learn about changes in carbonate ion concentration, something important to calcifying marine organisms that make shells and hard structures out of calcium carbonate (for example, shellfish and corals). Students apply their learning by interpreting water quality data from Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery. In Lesson 4, students research the possible impacts of OA to ecosystems and humans. In Lesson 5, students examine possible solutions to OA by brainstorming ways to reduce CO2 emissions, identifying barriers to taking action, and exploring which household actions have the greatest potential impact. A recommended culminating Call to Action project has students identify a target audience and try to persuade their chosen audience to take action."
