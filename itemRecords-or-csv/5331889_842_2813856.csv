12,Abstract:,"Torrey Canyon, Santa Barbara, Argo Merchant, and Amoco Cadiz are headline markers of the history of oil spill pollution. Each are well-known examples of how oil spill catastrophes can affect the marine and coastal environments and the lives of those who depend on these environments for their living. Each of these incidents, and others in turn, sparked public outcry, scientific studies, and legislative proposals to deal with the problem. The energy crisis, Alaska pipeline oil, deepwater ports, and increased OCS activity are indicators of the present and future scope of the problem. They too have sparked public discussion and legislative proposals. The scope of this paper is an outline and discussion of the various federal and state regulatory programs which have been formulated to deal with the oil spill pollution problem in three contexts: cleanup of spills, liability of spillers, and compensation for damages. The purpose of this analysis is to provide examples of how a state through its laws can deal with the problem of oil spill pollution. the text and footnotes are also designed to serve as a source of background material for legislative, regulatory, or managerial proposals. It should be noted that prevention of oil spills should be the primary goal of any program directed at the oil pollution problem. This aspect is discussed throughout the report in terms of pipelines, tankers, facility siting, and in this section where applicable."
