12,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to ascertain the effects of anomalous oceanographic conditions on early-juvenile Pacific hake ""Merluccius productus"" through an examination of abundance, growth rates, spawn-date distributions, and diet in coastal nursery grounds. The study utilized collections from two consecutive years of El Nino conditions, one year of La Nina conditions, and one non- anomalous year. Ontogenetic differences in diet were considered."
