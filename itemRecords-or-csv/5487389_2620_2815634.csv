10,Abstract:,"Section 8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act mandated sharing of the revenues from tracts that included oil and gas pools underlying the federal-state boundary 3 miles offshore. Revenues were to be split based on agreements negotiated by the Secretary of Interior and the relevant coastal state governor or on `fair and equitable' divisions made by the federal district courts. Only one agreement was concluded. Texas and Louisiana sued to force distribution of their shares of $6.1 billion in 8(g) funds held in escrow. In 1986 Congress divided the escrowed 8(g) revenues approximately 27% to the adjacent states and 73% to the federal government and legislated the same split for all future 8(g) revenues. This article examines the complex issues that section 8(g), as amended, raises for the management of federal and state submerged lands. Section 8(g)'s broader implications as the only federal-state ocean resource revenue-sharing mechanism currently in place also are addressed."
