12,Abstract:,"The Boggs Bill mandates that 5 percent of all bulk commodities traded by the U.S. would be carried in U.S. flag vessels in the first year after enactment of the bill, and this percentage would increase one percent each year until 20 percent of bulk commodities traded is carried on U.S. flag ships. This bill would directly affect Pacific Northwest wheat exports since nearly all grain is shipped in dry bulk vessels. Since charter rates of U.S. flag vessels are 100 to 200 percent higher than those of foreign flag vessels, the larger the percentage of cargo reserved for U.S. flag vessels, the larger the total of shipping costs. Any increases in the ocean freight rate between the U.S. and importing countries could reduce both the volume of wheat traded and its price at U.S. ports. The authors focus on how the proposed changes in existing cargo preference legislation in support of the domestic merchant fleet would affect regional grain shipments and prices."
