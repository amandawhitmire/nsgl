18,Abstract:,"Nitrogen is a key nutrient limiting productivity of many biological systems, including grasses grown for seed in western Oregon. Application of adequate amounts of nitrogen in fertilizer is a vital component in profitable production of nearly all non-​leguminous crops, including cereals, pasture, and grass seed. To better understand the opportunities for more efficient use of nitrogen fertilizer by western Oregon agriculture, we sampled streams draining 40 sub-basins of the Calapooia River basin on a monthly basis from October 2003 through January 2007."
