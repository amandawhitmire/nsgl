12,Abstract:,"Phytoplankton production (P) and community respiration (R) were studied during a summer 2007 cruise west of the mouth of the Mississippi River. The offshore estuarine ecosystem affected by this river is large and extends over most of the Louisiana continental shelf To document offshore spatial patterns of P and R, we collected ambient water samples for oxygen measurements and conducted 24 hour dark respiration experiments. The respiration measurements showed a strong river influence, with highest R inshore and near the river. Experiments and modeling showed considerable complexity in deriving P estimates from oxygen measurements, and a new method is proposed for estimating minimum PIR ratios from oxygen isotope measurements. Combining the PIR and R estimates yielded conservative (minimum) estimates of P across the shelf system, with P showing strong river forcing. Average R in surface and bottom waters was respectively 19 and 9 mmol m-3/day, average P/R was 1.0, and average P in surface waters was 20 mmol m-3/day. Bottom R that is important for hypoxia may reflect mostly inputs from decomposing springtime phytoplankton, because during the summer July cruise, bottom R was not closely coupled to P in overlying waters. Correlations of R and P with salinity and chlorophyll were relatively strong (r values of 0.7 to 0.9). In the future, field P measurements with oxygen isotopes should be useful for calibrating remote sensing techniques to better track how shelfwide productivity varies over time and space in response to river forcing."
