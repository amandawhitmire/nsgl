9,Abstract:,"The goal of the Oregon Coho Salmon Plan is not merely to prevent the extinction of coho salmon in the coastal region, but to restore salmon populations. Efforts to restore salmon must focus on improving the fish's habitat in the watersheds it lives in, along with addressing other factors of its decline, such as harvest and hatchery effects on the species. Coastal residents have a critical role to play in improving fish habitat in watersheds. This publication is designed to help readers understand the fundamentally important how, when, and where coho salmon live in watersheds and what people can do to help."
