13,Abstract:,"This document is intended for policymakers so they can make informed decisions about upgrading or removing tide gates in an effort to improve conditions for Oregon’s native migratory fish andother animals and plants that inhabit estuaries. It has two main sections: The first includes anoverview of the technical aspects of tide gates, including non-traditional ones. The second contains findings from a review of scientific literature about upgrading or removing tide gates as well as conclusions from a review of estuary restoration projects involving tide gates. Based on those findings, we’re also including recommendations to guide future investments in, and monitoring of, restoration projects associated with tide gates. This document summarizes parts of a 140-page publication, Ecological Effects of Tide Gate Upgradeor Removal: A Literature Review and KnowledgeSynthe​sis, that the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board (OWEB) funded through a 2016 grant to a team at Oregon State University. That report aimed to help readers understand how tide gates affect water quality and fish. It also sought to help OWEB understand the effectiveness of its investments in estuary habitat restoration projects involving tide gates so it can target future investments."
