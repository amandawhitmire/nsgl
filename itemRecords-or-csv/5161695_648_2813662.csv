10,Abstract:,"In order to comply with such proposed regulations, food processors SHALL set forth, IN WRITING, the procedures they use to identify the control points in the processing operations and the hazard associated with each point, and to establish adequate control measures and an adequate monitoring plan for each point. In short, it will require food processors to establish safety assurance programs based on the rational and systematic approaches of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control PointsÂ (HACCP) concept. This bulletin is intended to explain HACCP and explore its applications in the seafood industry of the Pacific Northwest."
