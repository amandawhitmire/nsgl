10,Abstract:,"The Model TA-IA air temperature system was developed by Oregon State University for the U, S. Coast Guard so that several of the 13thDistrict stations will have standardized equipment to measure and report local air temperature to National Weather Service forecast centers for their use in making coastal weather forecasts. The Model TA-1A air temperature system is similar to the Model TW-1A sea temperature system, but differs in the temperature range."
