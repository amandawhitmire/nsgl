12,Abstract:,"In a recent article, Chapman et al. (2003) assessed the potential risk of establishment by marine bivalve species that have arrived in the United States through trade in live seafood. Here we draw attention to a poorly documented aspect of their methods and their misuse of base- rate probabilities. Although our criticisms cast doubt on Chapman et al.'s calculations of the risk for establishment of species in trade, the most general message of the paper remains unscathed: trade in live seafood is a significant source of invasive species and should be subject to greater risk management. Our criticisms concern how the risk posed by the species in trade should be estimated. These estimations are central in the ongoing development of quantitative methods to as- sess the risk of establishment of non-indigenous taxa of all kinds in many pathways (National Research Council 2002)."
