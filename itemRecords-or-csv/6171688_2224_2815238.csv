10,Abstract:,"""Much of what we learn, we learn because we want to, because events in our lives intrinsically motivate us to find out more,"" say Lynn Dierking and John Falk, Oregon Sea Grant professors in the College of Science at Oregon State University (OSU). ""Under these conditions, we learn not only what we want, but also where, when, and with whom we want. This is free-choice learning, learning that is guided by the individual learner's own needs and interests."" Learn more about the fascinating concept of free-choice learning in this six-page, full-color reprint from the winter 2009 issue of OSU's Terra magazine."
