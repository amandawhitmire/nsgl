10,Abstract:,"Between 1978 and 1993, six excavations took place at an archaeological site (a native settlement called Nah-so- mah), on the south side of the Coquille River, near its mouth. This site has preserved more from the past than has any other coastal Oregon prehistoric site. Viewing Nah-so- mah's prehistory through its fauna has produced an understanding of the habitat and the way in which people used it over a long occupation. It has helped in the reconstruction of the site geologically as well as culturally. Native use of sea mammal and bird resources throughout this period show that the Coquille offered a wide range of rocky-coast and estuarine resources, including the presence of a number of sea mammals. Bones of birds, notably marsh and bay ducks and cormorants, are common in the site, with rare appearances of ocean and land birds. Consistent use of barnacles and sea mussels is also documented. There is considerable evidence of elk and deer harvesting. Skeletal remains of carnivores occur in low frequencies across the site."
