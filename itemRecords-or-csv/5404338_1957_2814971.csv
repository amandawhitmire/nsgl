10,Abstract:,"Considerable attention has been devoted to the evaluation of grain threshold or initiation of sediment motion by a water current such as a river. However, nearly all of the experiments attempting to derive quantitative relationships for threshold predictions have focused on essentially uniform grain sizes. That approach ignores the potential for selective entrainment of grains having different sizes and densities. Because of the importance of selective entrainment to a number of geological processes, a review of existing measurements has been undertaken involving a number of data sources from both laboratory and field studies."
