12,Abstract:,"This manual is intended to provide guidance in phases which involve artificial seed production by the emerging oyster seed industry. In addition to that rather broad objective, this manual has three more specific purposes. First, it will present the ""state of the art"" in oyster hatchery techniques. The second objective of this manual is to present new techniques that have not been rigorously tested anywhere. Third and finally, the manual will describe a method for evaluating hatchery efficiency."
