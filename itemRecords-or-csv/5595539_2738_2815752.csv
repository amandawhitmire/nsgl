12,Abstract:,"Several recent studies have concluded that there is a negative linear relation between environmental temperature and otolith Sr/Ca ratio. This relationship, coupled with assignment of age to each microprobe sample site, has been used to infer the relative temperature histories of wild-caught fish. However, precision of back-calculated temperature estimates should be examined in greater detail. Researchers here examined the precision associated with measuring Sr/Ca ratios in fish otoliths and demonstrated how this error affects temperature estimates derived from published regressions. Because the level of precision may affect conclusions of studies relating otolith Sr/Ca levels to environmental temperature, it is important to know the analytical conditions under which each study is conducted."
