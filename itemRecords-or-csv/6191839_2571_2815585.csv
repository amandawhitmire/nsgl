11,Abstract:,"Global aquaculture is rapidly expanding to help fill the widening gap between seafood demand and supply from capture fisheries. United States aquaculture production accounts for only about 1.5 percent of total global production, and there has been little expansion over the past decade. The U.S. depends on imports to meet about 80 percent of its seafood demand, at an annual cost of $13 billion. Future availability of seafood for U.S. consumers is an issue worthy of immediate attention by policy makers and society. In response, NOAA is facilitating development of marine aquaculture, including offshore aquaculture. The forum reviewed in this white paper represents a first step in providing information on current scientific, technical, economic, environmental, and social aspects of offshore aquaculture, to better evaluate its potential in the Pacific Northwest."
