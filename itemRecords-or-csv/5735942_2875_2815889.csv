11,Abstract:,"The Endangered Species Act of 1973 reflects a national policy favoring the diversity of life. The federal law seeks to prevent the extinction of species that are endangered or threatened by severely restricting the circumstances under which such species can be intentionally or unintentionally 'taken' (disturbed). Two legal experts explain the Endangered Species Act and discuss issues surrounding it including protections, critical habitat, economic considerations, and recovery plans."
