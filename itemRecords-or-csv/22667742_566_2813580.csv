13,Abstract:,"This webinar features George Waldbusser, a biogeochemist at Oregon State University who studies how carbon dioxide is changing the chemistry of the ocean and affecting shellfish, including oysters and pink shrimp. In this webinar, George talks about how he wasn't sure what he wanted to do after graduating from high school in 1990. He tried mechanical engineering for a semester at the New York Institute of Technology. Then  he took business classes for a semester at a community college. After that he worked for five years in a union job as an operating engineer at  two power plants. A chance encounter with a seafloor ecologist at St. John's University in New York City led him to a career in oceanography. In 2009, he became a professor at OSU, where he is also the director of the earth, ocean and atmospheric sciences graduate program. 	Lindsay Carroll, who coordinates Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program, serves as a moderator on this webinar, which was recorded on December 9, 2020."
