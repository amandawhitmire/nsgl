11,Abstract:,"Both experiments and models were used to determine the effects of conventional (water-bath) vs. ohmic (electrical resistance) cooking of Pacific whiting surimi paste. Ohmic heating under a high voltage gradient (1200 V/m) resulted in a heating rate 11 times higher than that of conventional (90 degrees C water-bath) heating for a cylindrical sample of 19 mm diameter. Results also show the significant effects of the two heating mechanisms upon the time during which the sample center dwells within the critical enzyme activity range. The effects of voltage gradient across the sample, moisture content, heat exchange with the surrounding ambients, and electrode design were also investigated."
