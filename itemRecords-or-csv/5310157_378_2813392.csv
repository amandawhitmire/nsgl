Second, through the inclusion in each issue of ""Fish Law Briefs"" providing a format in which the pubic may be apprised of the numerous on-going developments impacting upon the Columbia's salmon and steelhead. Cover articles include: Securing a fair share: Indian Treaty rights and the ""Comprehensive"" plan for the Columbia River; An evaluation of the Columbia Basin Fish and Wilife Program; Developments in the Law: 1979-1983."
