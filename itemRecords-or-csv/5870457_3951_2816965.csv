11,Abstract:,"A collaborative, multi-year initiative is underway to increase the resiliency of Pacific Northwest ports and harbors to earthquake and tsunami hazards. It is believed that the integration of stakeholder preferences and scientific expertise within a coastal hazard decision support system will create a robust model from which to develop multi-user vulnerability reduction and post-event recovery strategies. This preliminary report describes the objectives of this project and methods of data acquisition and analysis."
