9,Abstract:,"Regardless of their professional titles, those who communicate about science with non-specialists are communicators (among other things). Familiarity with findings of communication science can therefore be an advantage. A model for ""nonpersuasive communication"" will be presented, which is very compatible with the communication that Sea Grant traditionally engages in. Nonpersuasive communication derives from research in decision making and depends on understanding the mental models that decision makers have. The methods of empirical research to discover these mental models include open-ended interviews, focus groups, and surveys. The use of these methods recently by Oregon Sea Grant to assist coastal communities prepare for climate change will be highlighted."
