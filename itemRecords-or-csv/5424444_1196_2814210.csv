12,Abstract:,"The institutional capability of the State of Oregon to manage the territorial sea under its jurisdiction recently was examined with regard to oil and gas development, marine mineral mining, kelp harvesting, oil spills and waste disposal. In addition to resource and legal analyses, the authors identified problems and suggested solutions for user-group conflicts, outmoded laws, gaps or overlaps in responsibility, and state and federal interagency coordination. Major conclusions are presented along with suggestions regarding the usefulness of such studies to other coastal states."
