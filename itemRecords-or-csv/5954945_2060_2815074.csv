12,Abstract:,"Recently, these authors reported that electron beam could effectively inactivate ""Staphylococcus aureus"" in surimi seafood while retaining superior color and texture compared to thermal pasteurization. This work takes a closer look at changes in physicochemical properties of surimi and surimi gels upon varying doses of electron beam in relation to protein-protein interactions."
