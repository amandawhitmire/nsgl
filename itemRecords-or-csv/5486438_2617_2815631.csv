10,Abstract:,"Port administrators in the U.S. and abroad need extensive instruction; unfortunately, traditional instructional methods (workshops, seminars, field trips, etc.) have not satisfied this need. The Improving Port Performance (IPP) program launched by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development is quite effective, but still reaches only a fraction of those people desiring and needing instruction. Researchers have found that computer assisted video instruction can be used effectively in an unstructured environment, thereby eliminating the need for port administrators to leave their offices for instruction. The four instructional modules currently available are described: (1) the port decision-making process, (2) port management information and analysis, (3) ports and the local economy, and (4) project planning implementation."
