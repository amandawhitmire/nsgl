18,Abstract:,"Improper handling of albacore tuna can cause the fish to produce histamines, and this in turn may cause consumers to fall ill with histamine poisoning. Formation of histamines can be controlled by chilling and holding the fish at a low temperature. In 1994 researchers investigated histamine control measures on fishing vessels in order to establish optimal chilling procedures. This paper reviews the findings of that investigation and gives recommendations for both complying with FDA standards and ensuring a high- quality product."
