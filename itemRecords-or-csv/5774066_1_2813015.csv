11,Abstract:,"Biennial report for the Oregon Sea Grant College Program for 1991-1993 dedicated to William Q. Wick (October 24, 1927-December 15, 1991). Words from Robert E. Malouf, Directory, Oregon Sea Grant: I'm relatively new to Oregon Sea Grant, having come here less than two years ago. But what strikes me about this program is its long and, I think, excellent track record. As coastal and marine issues have evolved, Oregon Sea Grant has been in the right places at the right times, pushing issues forward and helping people use coastal resources wisely. Sea Grant has been a catalyst, providing start-up money for worthwhile projects, supporting people who have shaped our understanding of the ocean. Sea Grant hasn't always been visible-by name. It seems to me that Sea Grant people here in Oregon care more about getting the job done than they do about getting credit for it. As a result, it's sometimes difficult to get a handle on just what Sea Grant is. It's not just a program or a network. It is an approach to solving problems and addressing opportunities. Sea Grant is a way of thinking. Most important, it is people. For a quarter of a century, our people have touched every aspect of coastal life, solving problems and addressing needs through research, extension, and communications. Research is something we do very well. Sea Grant's highly competitive research grants program is structured to select and support only the finest science. But if you really want to make things happen, research alone is not enough. What makes Sea Grant different is our institutionaliz​ed and carefully nurtured association with coastal decision makers, resource users and managers, and everyday citizens. Our Extension Sea Grant Program and Communications Office are among our most visible elements, helping ensure that the results of relevant, timely research are broadly disseminated- and, more important, that they are put to work. Sea Grant is uniquely adept at striking a balance between the necessarily deliberate pace of cutting-edge scientific inquiry and the public's need to know answers now, and to act now, to address pressing issues. I'm getting into the swing of Oregon Sea Grant and I must say that it's an exciting place to be. Let me share with you a few highlights of the Oregon program-​scientists, Extension agents, and communicators and the things they have done or helped make happen. Consider this report a snapshot of some of the most pressing challenges facing the Pacific coast, and what Oregon Sea Grant is doing to help address those challenges."
