12,Abstract:,"Your students are about to embark on an exciting adventure in learning at the South Slough Estuarine Sanctuary. Their entire experience, from the preparation materials and on-site experience, to the follow-up parts of the program, has been carefully planned and prepared to assure a quality experience with plenty of solid, good learning. As important as the knowledge your students will gain is the enthusiasm and excitement which accompanies it. At the South Slough, learning is fun and full of adventure, and you are invited to join in. This booklet will briefly explain the program and your suggested roles. Program Goals: ""An estuary is one of the richest places on earth."" Preparation materials, on-site experiences, and follow-up activities are aimed at the following supporting goals: an understanding of what an estuary is; why an estuary is important; and Knowing that estuaries change because of natural processes and man's use."
