11,Abstract:,"Wetlands are parts of landscapes that merge from wet to dry: swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. They lie between the sea and the land, at the mouth of river, at the edge of a lake, or in low-lying fields. They are areas inundated or saturated by surface or ground water frequently enough, and for long enough periods each time, to support vegetation that is mostly adapted to saturated soil conditions. Intertidal salt marshes are a type of wetland that is generally a feature of the earth's temper ate regions. Intertidal salt marshes develop where river or marine sediments are available and where there is shelter from the direct attack of ocean waves: behind sand spits, behind barrier islands, or (as on the Oregon coast) within estuaries of large rivers protected bays. This fact sheet goes on to include how tides play a vital role, how salt marshes develop, and how to protect them."
