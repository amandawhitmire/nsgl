11,Abstract:,"Olympia oyster populations are threatened due to a variety of natural and human-made causes. Olympia oysters live in estuaries, which change over time due to natural and human events such as earthquakes and dredging. Before we can restore native oyster populations, we first must understand the oyster's environment and the estuary conditions needed for survival. This exhibit shows how scientists are figuring out how to do that."
