10,Abstract:,"This study concerns seasonal patterns in the acquisition of dietary protein by a suspension-​feeding bivalve. Protein uptake by mussels ""Mytilus trossulus"" was assessed at different times of the year by measuring in-vivo ingestion, digestion and assimilation of microencapsulat​ed, radiolabeled protein, which was added in small quantities to an otherwise unaltered natural diet. This method allows the mussel's acquisition of a defined nutrient, such as protein, to be determined without altering the biochemical composition of natural foods. The observed pattern of protein utilization was then compared to seasonal changes in a variety of physiological characteristics of the mussels as well as the composition of experimental and natural diets."
