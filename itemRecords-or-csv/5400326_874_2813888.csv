11,Abstract:,This paper presents capital cost estimates for a single and two separate sewerage treatment facilities to serve the City of Tillamook and the Highway 101 North Sanitary District. These estimates demonstrate that the total capital cost of a single treatment facility is less than the total costs of separate City and District facilities; they further show that both the City and District can benefit from a single facility designed to meet their needs jointly.
