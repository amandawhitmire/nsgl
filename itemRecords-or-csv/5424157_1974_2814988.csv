11,Abstract:,"Australia, Canada, the U.S. and New Zealand claim 200-mile exclusive resource zones based on the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf provisions. Constitutional arrangements with respect to federal-state (Australia, U.S.) and federal-â€‹provincial (Canada) roles offshore historically have followed remarkably similar paths that now are diverging in important ways which are the focus of this paper. New Zealand illustrates progressive EEZ management uncomplicated by the difficult federalism questions present in the other three. Australia and Canada illustrate creative approaches to overcoming EEZ federalism issues that have hindered improvements in U.S. EEZ management. From these experiences, suggestions for restructuring U.S. EEZ governance are derived."
