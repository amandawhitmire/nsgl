12,Abstract:,"Pesticides are widely used to control undesirable pests and may be applied directly to water or lands directly adjacent to water. Pesticides are an option for habitat restoration but there can be unintended consequences to native, threatened and endangered species. There is very little information on the impacts of pesticides and best management practices (BMPs) on NOAA Trust Species. The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive report of pesticide best management practices for use in aquatic environments and relate these BMPs for the protection of aquatic species, specifically NOAA Trust Species. The project focuses on aquatic pesticides including insecticides, fungicides, algaecides, herbicides, piscicides, molluscicides and mosquitocides. The final product will include a database of pesticide label information, empirical data on the acute and chronic toxicity of each pesticide and its formulations, identify gaps in knowledge to pesticide use, trends, fate in aquatic systems, synergistic effects and best management practices for NOAA Trust Species. Life history and biogeography data for each NOAA Trust Species will be used along with toxicity data to determine the greatest risk for exposure/impact to help inform BMPs. NOAA needs this information to develop a pesticides general permit application as it relates to NOAA Trust Species. Challenges of this project include addressing NOAA Trust Species when there is very limited direct impact data as well as extrapolating data from surrogate species which may have more toxicity and impact data. Another challenge is creating a database that is intuitive and useful for managers in making decisions about pesticide use and restoration for NOAA Trust Species."
