12,Abstract:,"This work consolidates from many sources features of the fresh frozen shrimp industry in terms of its product volume, value, growth trends and position relative to other Oregon seafood commodities. Market structure and functions are described as the product moves from the fisherman through the processor, broker, wholesaler and retailer to the consumer. There is brief speculation on needs for future studies of marketing."
