13,Abstract:,"Reflection of an obliquely incident solitary wave onto a vertical wall is studied analytically and experimentally. We use the Kadomtsev-​Petviashivili (KP) equation to analyze the evolution and its asymptotic state. Laboratory experiments are performed using the laser induced fluorescent (LIF) technique, and detailed features and amplifications at the wall are measured. Due to the lack of physical interpretation of the theory, the numerical results were previously thought not in good agreement with the theory. With proper treatment, we demonstrate that the KP theory provides an excellent model to predict the present laboratory results as well as the previous numerical results. The KP theory also indicates that the present laboratory apparatus is too short to achieve the asymptotic state. The laboratory and numerical results suggest that the maximum of the predicted four-fold amplification would be difficult to be realized in the real-fluid environment. The reality of this amplification remains obscure."
