11,Abstract:,"Young adults in Alaska's fishing community possess two critical components for the sustainability of their community. First, they care deeply about Alaska and its resources. Second, they feel a profound connection to the fishing community. Yet they find themselves facing the challenge of how to help their fishing community transition to a sustainable future. Once completing their undergraduate degree-often in Alaska-many head to the Lower 48 to get graduate degrees and the skills needed to execute their plan to return. This paper shares an example of a young Alaska fisherman who did just that: his history, his experience, his education and research at Oregon State University studying the vulnerability of fishing communities to climate change and variability, and now his job with an Alaska seafood company. In short, walking proof of how investing in higher education-near and far-can contribute to Alaska's fishing community sustainability."
