15,Abstract:,Furunculosis and bacterial kidney disease (BKD) are two salmonid diseases which have presented particularly difficult problems in terms of vaccine design. The prevention and treatment of BKD and furunculosis have become major goals of fish disease specialists around the world. This paper discusses pitfalls and possibilities in the quest to develop efficacious vaccines against BKD and to improve on available vaccines against furunculosis.
