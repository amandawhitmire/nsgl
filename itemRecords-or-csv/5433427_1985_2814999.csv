12,Abstract:,"The major corticosteriods secreted by interrenal tissue and those present in plasma of juvenile coho salmon are determined. Stress and seawater acclimation produced marked elevations in plasma levels of both cortisone and cortisol and also resulted in long-lasting changes in plasma cortisone:cortiâ€‹sol ratios. In resting fish, cortisone concentrations were similar or higher than cortisol levels. It is concluded that cortisol is the primary steriod secreted by the interrenal tissue of coho salmon, and that plasma cortisone arises primarily from the peripheral conversion of cortisol to cortisone. The relatively high levels of cortisone in resting fish and its increase following stress and seawater acclimation suggest the possiblilty of a biologically significant role for this hormone."
