13,Abstract:,"This OSU Extension Service guide is a quick field resource to help identify native and nonnative fish species found in seasonal watercourses of the Willamette River floodplain. The guide contains photographs of each fish species at different ages and sizes, with basic descriptions and background information on the ecology of each species. Each species description has a section called “Key characteristics​.” This section lists features that will help you correctly identify that species. There are arrows on some of the pictures that draw attention to certain characteristics​."
