14,Abstract:,"Toxic Microcystis blooms associated with very high levels of the liver toxin microcystin have occurred in Copco Reservoir on the Klamath River during the last several summers. We have characterized the genetic diversity of Microcystis present throughout the 2007 bloom season (June through October) in surface samples taken near the Copco dam. We have determined the DNA sequences of two target loci, cpcBA (phycocyanin B/A intergenic region) and ITS (16S/23S ribosomal RNA gene internal transcribed spacer) by constructing clone libraries of PCR products produced with cyanobacterial-specific primer pairs. Based on information from both target loci, distinct sub-populations of Microcystis variants (strains) could be distinguished. Distinct strains were present at the early and late ends of the bloom season, with other strains making appearances during the transition period in August. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify the relative gene copy number of cpcBA and mcyB, one of the genes needed for toxin production, in the Copco Reservoir and UKL samples. We observed a high proportion of toxigenic strains early in the bloom (90% in July), declining to very low levels (<2%) in September and October. A single sampling (21 August) from the water column of Upper Klamath Lake, which suffers blooms that are dominated by Aphanizomenon, indicated that its minority Microcystis population was genetically related to the early season highly toxigenic population in Copco Reservoir. The August UKL sample indicated the presence of>90% toxigenic Microcystis. These studies illustrate the extensive Microcystis population changes that can occur within a bloom season. We have also identified Microcystis strains whose presence can be monitored with specific genetic techniques to better understand bloom development or to follow remediation efforts."
