11,Abstract:,"Cyanobacteria are an important source of structurally new and biologically active natural products for drug discovery efforts. Kalkipyrone, in this study, was isolated from an assemblage of the marine cyanobacteria ""Lyngbya majuscula"" and ""Tolypothrix"" sp. Kalkipyrone is the first ""gamma""- pyrone-â€‹containing natural product isolated from a cyanobacterium, and it displays potent brine shrimp and gold fish toxicity."
