12,Abstract:,"Analysis of scales taken from 74 tagged Dover soles collected off Oregon demonstrated that scales were inadequate aging structures for this species. This contradicted earlier work that used marginal growth of scales and age-length observations as indirect validation methods. Errors in scale-age determinations were found for fish assigned scale ages of 5 years and greater. Relationships between expected scale age and actual age indicated that maximum longevity for Dover sole off Oregon may be in the range of 48-52 years, in contrast to the maximum scale age (28) observed for this species."
