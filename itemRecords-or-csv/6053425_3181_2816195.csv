11,Abstract:,"Commercial fishing can require long absences from home, is often financially unpredictable, and is inherently dangerous. The work of fishing presents special challenges and stresses to many fishing fathers. Fishing families often contend with Father's frequent absences and reappearances. Many fishing families express concern that Father misses out on birthdays and other important childhood events. In talking with fishing families, we found that many have terrific ideas for staying connected with fishing fathers. This publication summarizes ideas and activities to help families connect with fishing dads, based on what works for some fishing families. We also have included ideas from other parents, family advocates, and professionals. The information is based on developmental needs, abilities, and interests of specific age groups. Although some of the ideas are ""age specific,"" most can be adjusted to accommodate a broad range of ages."
