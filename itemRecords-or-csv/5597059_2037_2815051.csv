11,Abstract:,"Low power radio (LPR) is a specialized form of AM radio broadcasting. This technology made its debut in the 1970s to provide reports about traffic and weather conditions to automobile travelers. Since then, hundreds of LPR stations have been successfully dispensing information across the nation. This report describes LPR technology and suggests ways for Extension educators and for cities, parks, businesses and other governmental units to provide information and education to audiences they wish to reach."
