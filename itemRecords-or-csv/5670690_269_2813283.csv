10,Abstract:,This is the first of our newsletters from Oregon State's Ocean Engineering Program. It is hoped that you will find these briefs on our work to be relevant and interesting. The broad objective of the Ocean Engineering Research Program is to provide research and development that is necessary for the proper utilization of marine resources. Industrially supported research projects together with Sea Grant Program studies contribute significantly to creation of new knowledge on utilization and protection of the marine resources. This support helps train personnel to meet the nation's manpower requirements for utilization of resources from the sea.
