11,Abstract:,"International trade of agricultural products has always fulfilled an important role within our post-war world economy. Moreover, such trade has provided for the farmers of the Pacific Northwest expanded opportunities for production and export marketing. As this trade has grown ever more important, agricultural exports have contributed more significantly to a ""favorable"" U.S. Balance of Payments. The Pacific Northwest has specialized in the production of exportable grains, particularly wheat. So specialized has this production become that this region now finds itself heavily dependent upon the export market as a major source of support for its agricultural economy. In brief, so attractive has international trade now become that both importer and producer-​exporter have grown historically more dependent, one upon the other. This study was partially supported by a Sea Grant project from Oregon State University. KW: ENERGY; EXPORTING; ECONOMIC; TRANSPORTATION; WHEAT."
