9,Abstract:,"There are many reasons a recreational fisher might want or need to release a fish. The fish might not be large enough or of good enough quality. The fisher might be fishing for the fun of catching the fish and have no desire to eat it. The fisher may want to release fish from wild stock to breed and thus keep those stocks viable. However, the most common reason for releasing salmon and steelhead in Oregon is fishery regulations that say you must release them. The regulations are designed to protect our fishery resources, keep wild runs sustainable, and protect listed stocks. Release Methods for Wild Salmon helps you identify which species of fish you have to release and shows you how to release them without causing too much damage or stress. It also helps you distinguish wild fish from hatchery fish and shows how to identify the different salmonids so you do not inadvertently break the law."
