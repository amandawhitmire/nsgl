13,Abstract:,"Pacific whiting muscle tissue, infected with myxosporidia (""Kudoa paniformis""), contains high levels of proteolytic activity. Purification of the enzyme showed that the proteolytic activity is mainly due to cathepsin L as characterized by its chemical inhibition, activity against specific substrates, temperature, and pH profiles. Fractions eluted from a hydrophobic chromatography resin have two activity peaks (P-I and P-II) with an equal amount of total activities when analyzed with azocasein as a substrate. These data lead to several possibilities as to the composition of the peaks, including enzyme-â€‹inhibitor complex and free forms, isozymes, or heavy and light chains. The objective of this study was to characterize the identity of P-I and P-II by analyzing its activity with Z-Phe-Arg-NMec."
