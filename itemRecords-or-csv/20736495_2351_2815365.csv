9,Abstract:,"This thesis investigates the organization of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) and mesograzer communities across local and regional scales in three upwelling-​influenced estuaries located along the Oregon coast, USA. Eelgrass ecosystems are an important source of primary production in estuarine systems, providing numerous ecosystem services, including nursery habitat for commercial fish, water quality improvement, and sediment stabilization."
