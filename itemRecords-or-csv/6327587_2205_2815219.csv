11,Abstract:,"Nearshore hypoxia along Oregon's central coast is a recent phenomenon that may be largely impacting nearshore early life stage fish communities. Because little research has been conducted on non-​anthropogenic nearshore hypoxia, it remains unanswered how low levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) are affecting the escape behaviors and response times of juvenile flatfish. Escape behavior has relevance to the ability of juvenile flatfish to escape predation and successfully pursue prey. We analyzed in situ behavior of juvenile flatfish using a camera system mounted on a beam trawl for abundance, average length, escape frequency, reaction time, endurance and response behavior type. Analysis of this video footage created sampling and analytical guidelines of varying response times and behaviors of flatfish in affected waters, which will be valuable for future data collection and analyses. In the two days of footage analyzed, average length and frequency increased with greater bottom depth, likely due to ontogenetic migration of older individuals toward greater depths. No specific pattern with reaction, endurance and duration times were observed. ""Running"" appeared to be the most frequent response behavior overall, but no correlations with DO or depth were evident. Analysis of endurance times, with length factored out, were found to differ significantly with higher DO levels. However, further data must be collected and analyzed using the parameters established in this study to determine whether these patterns persist with continued hypoxia events, as DO levels in this report were not very low and sample size was small. Assessment of behavioral changes in juvenile flatfish over a range of DO levels will help provide insight into the future of the stock for stakeholders in the research and fishing communities."
