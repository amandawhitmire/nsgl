8,Abstract:,"This 13-minute video documents the experience of citizens, planners and civic leaders in three small Northwest communities as they work to bring their waterfronts back to life. Other small waterfront cities can learn much from the lessons of Astoria and Reedsport, Oregon, and Skamokawa, Washington. And they are sure to find inspiration in the resourcefulnessâ€‹, vision and dedication of the movers and shakers of these three cities."
