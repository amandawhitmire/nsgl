9,Abstract:,"In conclusion, the results from this study indicate only local scale 1km site buffer low development and forest have a significant relationships with MW EC during the dry season. There are also two marginally significant relationships between 100m riparian buffer LCLU and MW EC including: 1) agriculture during the wet season and 2) clear cut during the dry season. A lack of significant relationships between MW FIB and larger scales LCLU may be due to: 1) limited bacterial survival, 2) unaccounted for geomorphic effects, 3) coarse scale LCLU data which is 8 years old and 4) local presence of STP or OSDS to sampling site. EC in MW was likely from a human source as the TC/EC ratio was below 10 during the wet season. Considering a likely human source, it is concerning that ENT didn't have a similar relationship with LCLU as EC. However, our results showed that ENT is capable of growing in intertidal sediments. As suggested by previous studies it is likely that intertidal ENT was resuspended into the water column which could have confounded relationships with LCLU. This study shows that MW FIB concentrations are significantly correlated to upstream FW concentrations but only when comparing a single species across water bodies. There is no correlation between FW EC and MW ENT. Taken together these data show that FW streams are a major delivery mechanism of FIB to nearshore marine waters but this relationship is not evident when comparing two different FIB species (i.e. FW EC and MW ENT). This brings into question the validity of current monitoring methods. We also found that there was significantly more EC in FW than MW. In contrast, ENT had similar concentrations across both water body types. We hypothesize that ENT from intertidal sediments were resuspended via wave action and are thus served as an additional source of ENT to the MW column. From this study we have learned that: 1) LCLU impacts on MW are season, scale and species dependent, 2) currently used indicators (FW EC and MW ENT) make it difficult to examine the link between marine and terrestrial systems in regards to fecal pollution and 3) neither EC nor ENT is ideal for monitoring fecal pollution due to survival and growth in the environment. In order to better understand how nearshore marine water quality is affected by adjacent terrestrial systems, it is imperative that a universal indicator of fecal pollution be identified which can be used in both marine and freshwaters."
