12,Abstract:,"Solubility of rockfish whole muscle and actomyosin was minimum at pH 5 and gradually increased as the pH was shifted to acidic or alkaline pH. Acidic and alkaline solubilization was followed by isoelectric precipitation induced degradation of myosin heavy chain, resulting in a protein band of about 120 kDa. Both myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins underwent denaturation after acidic and alkaline treatment, exhibiting minimal solubility and absence of endothermic peaks. Acid- and alkali-treated muscle proteins readily aggregated upon heating, showing different dynamic rheological patterns compared with whole muscle and washed mince. Disulfide linkages occurred at a greater extent in gel prepared by alkaline solubilization, resulting in higher breaking force and deformation."
