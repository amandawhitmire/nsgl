14,Abstract:,"Geotextiles are synthetic fabrics which may be substituted for graded aggregate to protect ocean and coastal structures from erosion and soil instability adjacent to the structure. They are commonly used as a filter and as a structural membrane between an undisturbed sediment surface below and an erosion resistant coarse aggregate above. Geotextiles provide a cost effective alternative to graded aggregate in marine foundations. The need for rational design procedures has led to a theoretical description of the combined soil-geotextile behavior which quantifies failure potential and facilitates optimum geotextile selection. A two-dimensionaI analytical model has been developed for a three-​layered system, two different soils separated by a geotextiIe. The soil response is modeled by Biot consolidation theory and an unsteady form of Darcy's equation in which each soil is considered homogeneous, isotropic and linearly elastic. The soil layers are coupled through the geotextile, which acts as an elastic permeable membrane. Soil displacements and stresses and fluid pressures and flows are determined analytically. Potential failure conditions are identified from the cyclic shear stress ratio and from a Mohr-Coulomb stress analysis."
