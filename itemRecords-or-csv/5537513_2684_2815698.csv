10,Abstract:,"It is frequently desirable to assess stress in fish without the use of death as an endpoint. Effects of stress can be evident at several levels of biological organization in teleost fishes. Objectives of this paper are (1) to point out that performance tests are particularly powerful tools for assessing stress because they incorporate several levels of biological organization and are therefore integrative in nature, (2) to provide a conceptual framework for performance tests, and (3) to review the basis and status of some representative performance indicators of stress with laboratory examples."
