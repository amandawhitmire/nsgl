11,Abstract:,"Many cold- and temperate-water algae from the U.S. Pacific northwest produce metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acid origin. Other than tetrapyrrole pigments, pyrrole-â€‹containing natural products have been encountered only rarely in the marine environment, with distribution limited principally to sponges, bryozoans, cyanobacteria, and brown algae. Reported here, however, is the isolation of two new pyrrole natural products from the temperate-water red alga, ""Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis"", as diacetate derivatives."
