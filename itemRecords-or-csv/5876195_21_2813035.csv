11,Abstract:,"Besides overseeing the entire Oregon Sea Grant Program, Sea Grant Administration also conducts two alternating-​year fellowship programs (M/A-​16), which provide graduate students with opportunities to develop working knowledge of coastal and marine issues, management, and policy processes through assignment to either the Oregon legislature or one of the state's natural resource agencies. Through its program development funds (M/ A-2), Sea Grant also provides rapid response to unforeseen problems and opportunities. Modest program development grants are available to support research projects that arise outside the program's normal funding cycle or special requests for research-​related conference and travel fees."
