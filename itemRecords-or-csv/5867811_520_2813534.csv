13,Abstract:,"A combination of tides, storm, waves and winds brings 'flotsam,' 'jetsam,' and 'wrack' to the beach. In Oregon, this might include bull kelp, mudstones, egg cases, jellyfish, foam, 'cellophane tube worms,' hydroids, and agates. This booklet for both the casual stroller and the dedicated beachcomber, describes the origin of these items, and others."
