14,Abstract:,"""Snakehead rhabdovirus"" (SHRV) affects warm water fish in Southeast Asia and belongs to the genus ""Novirhabdoviru​s"" by virtue of its nonvirion gene (NV). Researchers produced viable recombinant SHRV, verified by detection of a unique restriction site engineered into the SHRV genome between the NV and polymerase genes. They then constructed a recombinant virus containing a nonsense mutation located 22 codons into the coding sequence of the NV protein. The NV knockout virus was produced at a concentration as high as that of wild-type virus in cultured fish cells, and the resulting virions appeared to be identical to the wild-type virions in electron micrographs. These initial studies suggest that NV has no critical function in SHRV replication in cultured fish cells."
