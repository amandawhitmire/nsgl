11,Abstract:,"Pieces of lithic debitage recovered from the Indian Sands site on the southern Oregon coast were subjected to multiple analyses in an attempt to understand (1) the lithic reduction strategy and nature of tool production, (2) site function, and (3) mobility among late-​Pleistocene coastal peoples. Here an anthropologist reports that the late-​Pleistocene lithic assemblage may be evidence of formal and expedient tool production using multidirectiona​l core technology and the manufacture or maintenance of bifacial tools. The assemblage also suggest that coastal hunter-​gatherers used upland lithic toolstone sources and that additional contemporaneous sites may be found by investigating known lithic raw material sources on the Northwest coast."
