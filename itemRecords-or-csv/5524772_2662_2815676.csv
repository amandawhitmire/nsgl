11,Abstract:,"Galactolipids occur widely in the plant kingdom and form the major lipid in photosynthetic tissues, being specfically associated with chloroplast membranes and thylakoids. Recent work has revealed that many red algae possess a previously unrecognized lipoxygenase-​type biosynthetic capacity. Additionally, two species of the genus ""Gracilaria"" were previously found to be a surprising source of cyclized icosanoids. The functional significance of these findings to algal physiology remains unknown at present. However, due to findings with ""Gracilariopsis​"" reported herein, in which icosanoid structures are found in linkage with galactolipids, further insight is provided into the possible functional roles of icosanoids in red algae."
