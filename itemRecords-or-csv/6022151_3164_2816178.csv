9,Abstract:,"A significantly untapped renewable energy source exists in the world's oceans. It is estimated that if 0.2% of the ocean's untapped energy could be harnessed, it could provide power sufficient for the entire world. Ocean energy extraction is an old concept, and it is currently seeing the benefit of advancing support technologies and an increasing awareness of potential future energy deficits. Girard, in Paris, registered the world's first wave energy device patent in 1799. Over more than 200 years of development, the number of patents has greatly increased and today there are currently more than 1500 ocean wave energy device patents. This thesis presents and examines the concept of using an ocean wave as the prime mover for a buoy-mounted, directly driven, electrical generator. The primary focus will be on two particular generator types, a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and a Wound Rotor Induction Generator (WRIG), and their reactions to a simulated wave profile. The simulations were based on the concept of a directly driven screw, either a roller screw or ball screw, and a sinusoidal wave profile. The development of this thesis moves through four sections: introduction of wave energy, the details of the experimentation that was conducted; the results of those experiments and the comparison with mathematical models; and finally the conclusion and recommendations for future experimentation in this area. A number of different experiments have been conducted for this thesis on the directly driven buoy generator scenario. They range from baseline control tests, which establish a characterizatio​n of the generators, to intricate multi-​directional reciprocating drive research. The reciprocating drive scenario is used to simulate a unidirectional direct drive, where one half of the stroke is used to generate electrical power and the energy from the other half of"
