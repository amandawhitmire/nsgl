13,Abstract:,"This article compares how bulk estuarine turnover timescales vary with tidal and river forcing from idealized forcing scenarios, using a three-​dimensional circulation model of the Yaquina Bay estuary. It compares bulk formula approaches—the tidal prism method, freshwater fraction method, and a relatively new estuarine timescale calculation method based on the total exchange flow (TEF)—to directly calculated timescales from particle tracking, to assess the utility of the bulk formula timescales."
