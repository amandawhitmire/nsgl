10,Abstract:,"We are investigating the geomorphologica​l variability and relative vulnerability to erosion and backshore flooding of coastal sand dunes in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Coastal dunes protect lives, infrastructure, and ecosystems particularly during severe winter storms with associated storm surges, large wave heights, and wave runup. Before the 1900's, the native plant Elymus mollis was the dominant dune grass in the PNW and dune geomorphology was largely determined by sediment supply and other physical factors with the backshore generally consisting of small hillocks and open sand (Cooper, 1958). The introduction of invasive beach grasses in the 1920's resulted in significant changes to dune geomorphology (Cooper, 1958; Seabloom and Wiedemann, 1994), particularly with the formation of relatively stable foredunes. Preliminary work suggests that the invasive grass Ammophila arenaria (European beach grass)is associated with taller, narrower foredunes while a second invader Ammophila breviligulata (American beach grass) is associated with shorter, broader foredunes. We hypothesize an ecological control on coastal vulnerability in that the taller dunes are more resistant to overtopping and flooding but possibly more susceptible to erosion while the shorter dunes may withstand erosion events but are more vulnerable to flooding. As part of a larger collaborative effort to determine the relative importance of physical and ecological mechanisms in controlling dune geomorphology, this study examines alongshore varying dune features such as dune crest height, dune toe height, and backshore slope from lidar elevation data along the PNW coast. These data are spatially compared with short- and long-term shoreline change rates and where available sediment grain size data to determine if statistically significant correlations exist. The data is also combined with the results of co-located vegetation surveys to confirm the preliminary relationships between plant species and dune geomorphology. If the different grass species do indeed have an order one affect on dune geomorphology, it is important to quantitatively understand how potential management strategies for the different species might impact coastal vulnerability. We run a series of dune erosion models for various PNW littoral cells with distinctly different dune heights and beach slopes. The models include a geometric model, an equilibrium profile model, and a (wave tank) calibrated wave impact model. The simulations are run with extreme storm condition scenarios to estimate event-scale dune erosion under varying ecological and geomorphologica​l regimes. We also examine event-​scaleflooding scenarios via a simple TWL model to again test our hypothesis regarding ecological controls on coastal vulnerability."
