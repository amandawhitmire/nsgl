11,Abstract:,"Firm-level data on U.S. produced surimi, the only seafood product that is graded on the objective measurement of several quality characteristics​, are used to estimate the effect of production variables (e.g., hours between harvest and processing) and policy variables (e.g., fishing seasons) on product characteristics​. Transactions data are then used to estimate hedonic equations and derive implicit prices for each characteristic of surimi used to produce seafood analogs and traditional products. Implicit prices are also estimated for surimi grade, location, and date. Several factors (including species) significantly affect surimi characteristics​. Color and gel strength have the largest price impact."
