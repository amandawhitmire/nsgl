13,Abstract:,"Joel Hedgpeth and I proposed a conference on ""Steinbeck and the Sea"" to Bill Wick, Director of the Oregon State University Sea Grant College Program, because we believed that such a meeting would open new vistas to students of Steinbeck. Bill concurred which means Sea Grant agreed to support the conference!, and Joel and I set ourselves to the task of planning a program of speakers who, among other things, would assess responsibly Steinbeck's interest in and knowledge of marine biology which, we agreed, is largely responsible for his enduring contribution to American letters."
