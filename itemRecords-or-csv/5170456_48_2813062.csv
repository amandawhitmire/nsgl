12,Abstract:,"In response to encouragement by the Sea Grant staff, the decision was made to form a departmental research team comprised of Ray M. Northam, Thomas J. Maresh and Mary Lee Nolan, and to submit a formal Sea Grant proposal to undertake study of land ownership and land use change in a portion of the Oregon coastal zone. Three project objectives were identified in the proposal submitted to the Sea Grant Program and the research conducted has been in accord with those objectives. The objectives were. 1. To investigate the magnitude, nature and locations of recent changes in land ownership in the Oregon coastal zone. 2. To establish relationships between changes in land ownership and changes in land use of individual land parcels. 3. To establish relationships between changes in land ownership, changes in parcel size and changes in land value."
