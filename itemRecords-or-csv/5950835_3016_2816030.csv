10,Abstract:,"A food safety problem in the thawing process is that the time required to thaw can be far longer than that required to freeze. For most conventional thawing processes, heat flows in through outer surfaces. Emerging technologies are producing faster results through various methods of internal heating. All seek to speed up process rates while maintaining high levels of quality and safety. This article reviews the current research."
