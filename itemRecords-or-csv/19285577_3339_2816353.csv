7,Abstract:,"The Blue Crab Bowl (BCB) is one of 25 regional competitions of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl (NOSB®). The first NOSB competition was launched in 1998 by the Consortium for Oceanographic Research and Education (CORE) to further its mission of supporting and expanding oceans sciences education during the International Year of the Ocean. In 2007, CORE merged with the Joint Oceanographic Institutions (JOI) to form a new organization, the Consortium for Ocean Leadership. Representing over 90 of the nation’s leading oceanographic institutions, universities, industries and aquariums, the Consortium office in Washington D.C. hosts the NOSB National headquarters. Virginia’s Blue Crab Bowl was among the original NOSB competitions. Designed to inspire and challenge high school students, the Bowl tests competitors’ knowledge of the marine sciences. Each match pits two teams of four students in an academic quiz-bowl format. Competitors use a buzzer system to respond to rapid-fire multiple choice and short answer questions read by a Moderator. Additionally, teams work collectively to produce written answers to complex analytical questions. This year, sixteen teams from around the Commonwealth compete in roundrobin divisions, then double elimination matches that narrow the field. The final tournaments rounds establish 1st – 4th place winners. The 1st Place team from the Blue Crab Bowl will represent Virginia in the national NOSB competition in Corvallis, Oregon, April 20-23, 2017."
