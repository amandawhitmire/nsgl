13,Abstract:,"The Marine and Maritime Slide Collection has been designed as a resource for courses in the Marine and Maritime Studies Program. Presently, the collection contains more than 1300 items ranging from ancient art to contemporary seascapes, from ships to flags and maps--a visual study exploring many aspects of our relationship to the sea. All items in the collection are available for classroom use. The collection is housed in the Art Department Slide Library, 215 Fairbanks Hall. The organization of this catalogue follows the arrangement of the collection; the numbered sections correspond to the contents of each tray of slides. the first five sections contain material on marine biology (I, Ia, II), charts (III), maps and diagrams (IV). The remaining sixteen sections represent marine subjects arranged by country of origin. A description of each slide is followed by its acquisition number in parentheses. This number is useful in locating individual slides in the collection. The Marine and Maritime Studies Program has been developed by the Oregon State University Humanities Development Program. Support for the Humanities Development Program comes from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Oregon State University Sea Grant College Program, and from Oregon State University."
