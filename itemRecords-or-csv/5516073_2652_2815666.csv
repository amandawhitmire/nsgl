11,Abstract:,"It appears that cortisol can have direct effects on cells of the salmonid immune system, suggesting the presence of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in those cells. Although GR have been found in a variety of tissues in fish they have not been reported in immune cells of fish, nor have they been reported in tissues of Pacific salmon ""Oncorhynchus"" spp. The objective of this study was to explore the possible existence of high affinity, low capacity GR in coho salmon and specifically locate GR in cells of the salmon immune system."
