12,Abstract:,"Surimi made from Pacific whiting (""Merluccius productus"") normally undergoes textrual degradation due to the presence of a heat-stable endogenous protease in the flesh. Heating to 70 deg C inactivates the protease, but before the surimi paste interior reaches that temperature under conventional methods, some degradation occurs. Ohmic heating is a method in which an alternating electrical current is passed through an electrically conducting product. Heat is internally generated due to the electrical resistance of the sample, supporting a rapid heating rate and uniform temperature distribution. However information about electrical conductivity of seafoods, particularly surimi paste, is lacking. Therefore, objectives here were: (1) to investigate effects of temperature, voltage gradient, moisture, and added salt content on electrical conductivity of Pacific whiting surimi paste, and (2) to establish an empirical model of electrical conductivity as a function of composition."
