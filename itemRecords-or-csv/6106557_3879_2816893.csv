11,Abstract:,"On the morning of August 29, 2005, southeast Louisiana was hit by the extreme winds and flood surge associated with Hurricane Katrina. Less than 3 weeks later, on September 24th, Hurricane Rita struck the southwestern part of the state. Louisiana's commercial seafood industry, already in decline for a number of economic reasons, was further crippled as a result of damage to vessels, docks, processors, and the distribution sector. Even those individuals who were able to fish immediately after the storms experienced problems, especially in the selling of their product, due to destruction of the input supply, distribution and local retail sectors."
