12,Abstract:,Toe stability is a key consideration in the overall design of many types of nearshore structures. Most rubble stability research has focused on the upper portion of breakwaters where the rubble is directly impacted by waves. An alternative approach is to incorporate more of the physical processes into the stability analysis. This requires a more detailed description of the flow field in and near the toe coupled with a rubble stability analysis. A simple model was developed to provide estimates of the flow and pressure in and near rubble toes. Preliminary kinematic results are encouraging and this model is presently being combined with rubble stability and scour models.
