13,Abstract:,"The Northern California Ecosystem off Oregon and Washington supports juvenile salmon and other commercially valuable fish species that feed on copepods and other zooplankton. Fluctuations in ocean conditions lead to variations in the types and numbers of copepods occurring off the Oregon coast. Because researchers have been regularly sampling copepods off the coast of Oregon for many decades, detectable patterns in the data can help characterize ecosystem health and forecast future ocean conditions. In this lesson, students examine long term copepod data to reveal patterns and make predictions. St​udents in grade level 9-12 will learn the following: • Scientists collect and utilize data and models to predict populations. • Fluctuations in copepod diversity and biomass are indicators of ocean conditions. • Observed patterns in data can inform future predictions. Le​arning Objectives: Students will be able to: 1. Describe relationships between copepod species richness and copepod biomass in the Northern California Current, 2. Identify multiple ocean conditions that tend to be favorable for salmon survival, and 3. Describe long term patterns in ocean conditions that could affect future salmon survival."
