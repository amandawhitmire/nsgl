13,Abstract:,"A workshop for faculty involved in marine affairs/marine resource management graduate programs was convened at Oregon State University in June, 1984. Reports on the nature and status of programs at each institution were presented. Discussions centered around student, curriculum, and faculty issues. Future needs and trends were addressed, as were program acceptance within the university community and by the private sector. There were mixed reactions regarding the need or desirability of developing Ph.D programs at this time. There was general agreement that faculty face problems in curriculum development and in getting recognition for their work. In that regard it was felt that promotion and tenure standards/evalu​ations/procedur​es should differ from those used in traditional science departments. The general consensus was that marine affairs/marine resource management is an emerging field in its own right."
