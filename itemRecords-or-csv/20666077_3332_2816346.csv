12,Abstract:,"To determine the invasion threat to the NE Pacific of marine algae arriving on Japanese debris from the 2011 Great Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, my colleagues and I took up the task of identifying the algal species on 42 of the most heavily fouled debris items that landed on the shores of Oregon and Washington between June 2012 and July 2016. Using both morphological and molecular methods, we identified 84 marine algal and cyanobacterial species and species complexes on these items and sequenced 51. Since many of these species are not well-described in the literature, a morphological account of the actual specimens has been prepared to assist in the detection of future invasions by these species in the NE Pacific. Part 1 provides an introduction to the study and pictures and descriptions of 29 red algal species and one red algal unknown that we discovered. Part 2 covers the brown algae, and Part 3, the green algae and cyanobacteria. In addition to this morphological documentation series, the reader is referred to the two other papers in our study cited on page 2 of the text."
