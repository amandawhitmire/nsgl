12,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus that can cause epizootics in wild and hatchery-reared salmon and trout. Epizootics of IHNV are presumptively diagnosed in the field; the final diagnosis depends on laboratory confirmation, which requires virus isolation and growth, and then serological identification. A procedure was needed to confirm IHNV diagnosis after the plates had been fixed with formalin and stained with crystal violet. Described here is an alkaline phosphatase immunocytochemi​cal (APIC) assay adapted to detect IHNV antigen in fixed, stained plates."
