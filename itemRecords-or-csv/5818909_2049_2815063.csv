10,Abstract:,"The Lower Columbia River Estuary Program (LCREP) has recently completed a management plan for achieving and maintaining biological integrity within the lower Columbia River ecosystem. The question of how to measure the biological integrity of the lower Columbia River is a critical part of assessing the river's health. In May 1999, LCREP held a workshop in Sandy, Oregon, to develop an approach to monitoring biological integrity. Some of the questions addressed were: Is biological integrity a philosophy, or is it a measurable quality? Can we identify the subsystems that constitute biological integrity? Can the subsystems be measured by a suite of indicators? Presentations and discussions from the workshop are summarized here."
