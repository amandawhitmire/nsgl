11,Abstract:,"In Yaquina Bay, Oregon, researchers observed very little overlap in the distribution of the invasive European green crab and the larger red rock crab. Red rock crabs dominate the more saline, cooler lower estuary and green crabs, the less saline, warmer upper estuary. Because caged green crabs survive well in the lower estuary, the authors tested the hypothesis that red rock crab prey on green crab and thus contribute to their exclusion from the lower estuary. A laboratory species interaction experiment determined that red crab, preys on the smaller green crab at a higher rate than on smaller crabs of their own kind."
