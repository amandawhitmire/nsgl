10,Abstract:,"As a result of mutual interference between West Coast crab fishermen and towboats with tows, a 'gentlemen's agreement' was reached in 1971 to provide towing lanes for towboats along a major portion of the West Coast. Almost every year since, a meeting has been held to review and revise these towboat lanes; some significant changes have been made. The general agreement is that crab fishermen will not put crab pots in the designated lanes. If they choose to do so, they forfeit the right to complain if tugs and tows destroy their pots. The towboaters agree to stay within the designated lanes, or well outside the fishing areas, as long as weather and ship safety will allow. The agreement has worked well over the years, saving millions of dollars for both fishing and towing industries. Included here are the 1988 annual meeting report, including any changes in lanes, and a revised 18 x 24 inch chart of the Columbia River to Destruction Island. Information for receiving past, present and future reports is provided."
