12,Abstract:,"A semidifferentia​ted tissue culture consisting of linear filaments in liquid suspension was established from ""Acrosiphonia coalita,"" a cold-water green macroalga known to express pharmacological​ly active oxylipins deriving from lipoxygenase metabolism of linolenic acid. The tissue was vegetively propagated by blending the filaments down to 1 mm in length prior to subculture. The filamentous ""A. coalita"" tissue suspension was successfully cultivated in an illuminated, stirred-tank bioreactor. A final cell density of 1083 mg dry cell weight was achieved within 15 days of cultivation from an initial cell density of 200 mg DCW/L. The addition of carbon dioxide elevated the consumption rate and stabilized pH during the light phase of growth, but did not improve biomass productivity."
