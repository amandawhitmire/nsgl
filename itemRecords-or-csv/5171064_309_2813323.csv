11,Abstract:,"This project analyzed the nature of trawl cable corrosion on Oregon coastal trawlers to evaluate the feasibility of corrosion control. The analysis leads to a detailed discussion of possible future experiments designed to accurately determine the amount and type of protection needed. This report also provides a discussion of wire rope and general corrosion principles. The corrosion analysis is based on a series of tests conducted on corroded trawl cable that Oregon trawl fishermen donated. The report suggests that sacrificial metal protection and/or electrical isolation between trawl cable and metal doors will most likely protect the cable, and proposes a series of experiments to determine accurately the need and usefulness for each type of protection.
