12,Abstract:,"This paper analyzes the effect of alternative institutional arrangement on the conservation of endangered species and economic activity on private land. Because landowners do not capture the full value of species conservation, their preferences on land use will not coincide with social preferences. Whether it is better to entice landowners to make socially referred decisions by paying compensation, or to limit the ability of landowners to affect outcomes through changes in the regulatory regime, depends on both practical implementation difficulties and distributive justice consideration."
