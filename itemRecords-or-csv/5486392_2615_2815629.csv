13,Abstract:,"How local heavy-mineral sorting of Oregon-coast beach sands affects interpretations of mineral assemblages was investigated based on factor analyses. Investigations involved three approaches: (1) factor analyses of multiple samples randomly collected from a single beach location; (2) comparisons of those results with detailed sampling from the same beach where the sampling was designed to determine the sorting of the minerals according to their respective densities and grain sizes; and (3) factor analyses of a synthetic data set which simulates the along-coast mixing of minerals from multiple sources with varying degrees of local grain sorting affecting the sample composition. The results indicate that sorting can significantly affect the results from factor analyses, with new factors introduced and with random irregularities produced in the spatial patterns of the factors."
