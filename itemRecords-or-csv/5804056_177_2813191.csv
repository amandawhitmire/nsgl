13,Abstract:,"Oregon Sea Grant (OSG) has developed a graphical database system to display how OSG is organized, what activities and programs it supports, and what those activities and programs accomplish. The database was originally designed to be used by program managers to explain the program to clientele, typically either those who make decisions about program funding or those who are supporters of the program. The program has applicability beyond Oregon. The purpose of this booklet is to make the software system available to any Sea Grant program that wants it."
