12,Abstract:,"Species introductions are among the most dramatic human- induced impacts on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems around the world. Stability patterns of an estuarine benthic community were investigated through guild interaction models representing the community before and after human-mediated species invasions. The study area was Yaquina Bay, a developed estuary on the central Oregon coast, U.S., where at least 12 species of nonindigenous invertebrates have been inadvertently introduced. Three of the introduced species are among the 10 most abundant invertebrate species in the intertidal benthic community. To estimate effects and potential risks of species introductions on the native community, the authors constructed 2 types of community models based on functional-â€‹group interactions, namely, activity guild models and trophic guild models. In both cases they observed that overall feedback in this community may be an ecological property and not an intrinsic property of large systems as such."
