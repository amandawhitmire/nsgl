10,Abstract:,"Since the Oregon Sea Grant College Program was established in 1971, the Communications office has produced dozens of films and videos, from very short public service announcements to hour-long documentaries, intended for specific audiences. As of 2014 our catalog contained more than 40 titles, most of them available these days on the Web. This compilation highlights diverse moments from a range of stories that presented important ocean and coastal topics and *issues*. Please note that older productions are not in their original quality as distributed; available second- or third-​generation copies were sometimes used. And all of this was compressed (and thus some quality was lost) for streaming on the Web. But this compilation preserves a glimpse of the important issues and the dedicated people of Sea Grant's history."
