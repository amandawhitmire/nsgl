12,Abstract:,"Cololabis saira (Brevoort), commonly referred to as ""saury"" or ""needlefish"" in English and ""sanma"" in Japanese, is one of three species belonging to the family Scomberesocidae​, order Beloniformes. A program has been initiated by the National Marine Fisheries Service(NMFS) to study the biology of saury and to investigate factors which are likely to be important to possible U. S. participation in an eastern Pacific saury fishery. The first step in the new program was to become fully informed on the Japanese saury fishery and to review research studies. In July 1968, NMFS contracted with the senior author to investigate Japanese saury industry «nd research facilities. The junior author made a survey of Japanese, Soviet, and domestic scientific literature. Accordingly, this report contains information on the Japanese saury fishery, summarizes biological studies on the western Pacific saury stock, and considers the less well-known central and eastern Pacific stocks."
