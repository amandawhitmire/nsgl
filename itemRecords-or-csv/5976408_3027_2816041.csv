12,Abstract:,"The overall objective of this study was to compare the halogenated monoterpenes produced by microplantlets of the red algae ""Ochtodes secundiramea"" and ""Portieria hornemannii"" that were cultured within a photobioreactor under identical conditions. Toward this end, the dominant cyclic halogenated monoterpene produced by both organisms in bioreactor culture was isolated and characterized. Furthermore, the yields of the dominant acyclic and cyclic halogenated monoterpenes shared by microplantlets of ""O. secundiramea"" and ""P. hornemannii"" were compared. Finally, a biogenic scheme for halogenated monoterpenes by cultured microplantlets was proposed that contained pathways shared by both organisms as well as pathways unique to each organism."
