12,Abstract:,"Between 1979 and 1984 there was a steady increase in the commercial harvest of ""Mytilus californianus"" from 13 open permit areas on the Oregon coast. Presently, the annual mussel harvest has leveled off, due not to market saturation but to supply. Market-size mussels (4-8 cm) are being depleted from the open permit areas faster than they are regenerating. At the same time, officials are reluctant to open more areas to the commercial harvest because of the public reaction to past practices. In 1979 some harvesters used rakes to denude completely a 20-m stretch of shore in South Yachats State Park on the central Oregon coast. This damage is still evident 9 years later, and experts estimate that it may take another 15-20 years before that site could again support a ""M. californianus"" fishery. Since that incident, commercial harvesters have been more conservative. They are required to leave at least one layer of mussels attached to the rocks, and many only hand pick individual market-size mussels. This study compares the growth rate and condition of submarket-size mussels in harvested and undisturbed plots. If a moderate harvest can be shown to have a stimulatory effect on the productivity of the remaining submarket-size mussels, much of the controversy over the controlled commercial mussel harvest could be defused."
