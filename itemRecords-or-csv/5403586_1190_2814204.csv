11,Abstract:,"Among Oregon's estuaries, Coos Bay is second in size only to the Columbia River Estuary. Numerous sloughs and inlets extend off the main bay, home to a wide variety of plant and animal life. Although alteration has been extensive, there are still important fish and wildlife habitat areas, including the South Slough National Estuarine Sanctuary (the first in the nation to be so designated). This folder tells a little about the Coos Bay Estuary, a few of the many species that inhabit it, and places where visitors can go."
