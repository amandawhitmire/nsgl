12,Abstract:,"This Fishing Families Project CD contains a guide to a two-day field trip between Newport and Florence, Oregon. It identifies two-dozen roadside stops where earth scientists can address the age, origin, and stratigraphic development of the dunes along the central Oregon coast. Many of the stops provide critical exposures that prompt more informed consideration of dunal slope stability, dunal aquifer management, and sustainable development in the coastal zone."
