13,Abstract:,"Scientists and fisherman have reported anecdotal observations of greater sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus (Berzin and Rovnin 1966) and squid abundance (Clarke1996b) above seamounts. Clarke (2007) suggests that sperm whales may forage oncephalopod species that drift or swim to seamounts for spawning, or possibly feeding.Yet, there is conflicting evidence regarding sperm whale association patterns with seamounts. Using habitat models, Waring et al. (2001) and Skov et al. (2008) found significant positive relationships between sperm whales and seamounts. Wong and Whitehead (2014) described seasonal sperm whale presence at one seamount in the North Atlantic. In comparison, habitat modeling by Torres et al. (2011) and nonmodeling work by Morato et al. (2008), found no association between sperm whale distribution and seamounts. This discrepancy between studies may be due to variation in scale and sample size, size of the study area (and amount of inherent bathymetric variation), classification of seamounts, and the resolution of data. For instance, encounter rates from Skov et al. (2008) indicate scale dependent variability of the modeled distribution of sperm whales in relation to bathymetry. Furthermore, Torres et al. (2011) recommended a more refined examination of seamount influence on sperm whale presence that accounts for the variation in seamount characteristics as a proxy for prey availability to whales."
