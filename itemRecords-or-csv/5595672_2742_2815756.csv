16,Abstract:,"Epizootics attributable to erythrocytic inclusion body syndrome (EIBS) occurred among populations of coho salmon ""Oncorhynchus kisutch"" cultured in seawater in Japan. Onset of the disease was correlated with water temperatures declining to below 10 degrees C. Symptoms of EIBS were severe anemia with hematocrits of less than 20% and corresponding changes in erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin concentration, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. Erythrocytes had characteristic inclusion bodies that contained enveloped viral particles with a diameter of approximately 77 nm. The disease was reproduced in artificially induced infections."
