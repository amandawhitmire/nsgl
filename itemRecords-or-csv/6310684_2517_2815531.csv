11,Abstract:,"While professional development in current ocean sciences research and ways to communicate it is widely available for K-12 teachers through a variety of venues, very few professional educators working with public audiences in aquariums and science centers have access to any ongoing professional development in content or pedagogical skills. In fact, in many sites, volunteers receive more training and ongoing training than do professional staff. This is especially troubling as most of what most people know about the ocean they learn from experiences outside of schools, and informal educators working in ISEs are a primary source of ocean sciences information for millions of visitors to aquariums and science centers annually. Over the last three years as part of our work with the Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence - Pacific Partnerships, we have worked with ocean scientists and educators to develop model professional development programs for informal educators. In this session, we will 1) outline the learning theory research that underlies our approach, 2) describe findings from a national needs assessment focused on professional educators in aquariums and zoos, and 3) outline evaluation findings from the creation, piloting, and refining of workshops for informal educators designed to teach new content in conjunction with new communication skills. We have found that there is a recognized need among both education staff and husbandry staff and leadership for high quality ocean sciences content and pedagogical skill building. We have also found that there is support for ongoing professional development for staff including release time and that online opportunities are of great interest in the field. We have also found that opportunities to combine active learning with high quality communications modeling and appropriate follow up can create effective learning environments for busy professionals. Findings from our front end and summative evaluations will be presented and discussed, and we will suggest directions scientists and educators may create university and ISE partnerships that work to create and carry out sustained programs of professional development regionally."
