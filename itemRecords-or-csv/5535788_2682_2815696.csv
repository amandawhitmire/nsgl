20,Abstract:,"One of the major factors that will have an impact on the success of the aquaculture industry is the control of diseases. Viral diseases are particularly important because there are no suitable treatments available; the control of viral diseases is based largely on expensive management techniques. This paper reports the successful development of prototype viral vaccines by recombinant DNA techniques. Two viruses were selected for vaccine development because these viruses affect economically important aquaculture species (salmon and trout) in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. In addition, these viruses, infectious hematopoetic necrosis virus (IHNV), and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), affect very young fish, and immunization of large numbers of fish at this size by immersion is fairly easy."
