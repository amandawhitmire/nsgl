14,Abstract:,"A simple analytical model for the wave-induced source term and the resulting pore pressure accumulation in marine soils has been developed. The dimensionless pressure accumulation is largest in a shallow soil and decreases with increasing soil depth. As the soil depth increases, the dimensionless depth of maximum pressure moves closer to the mudline. Pore pressure ratio profiles for the three soil depths show that the model provides an initial insight into the liquefaction process. Compared with laboratory observations, for the cases at or very near the point of liquefaction, there is reasonable agreement between the theory and data for both the source term and the pore pressure accumulation."
