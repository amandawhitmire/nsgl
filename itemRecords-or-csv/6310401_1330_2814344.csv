12,Abstract:,"National Standard Eight of the Magnuson-​Stevens Act requires the consideration of the importance of fishery resources to human communities when making changes in fishery regulations and also requires that when possible adverse economic impacts on fishing communities are minimized. NOAA's short-form fishing community profiles have been a wonderful addition to the tool box for helping to make policy decisions concerning communities and addressing the requirements of the Magnuson-​Stevens Act. The NOAA profiles have provided baseline information on a large number of communities involved in fishing. Yet, decision makers find themselves needing to avoid exacerbating or creating additional problems by having more knowledge and sensitivities to the perspectives and realities of fishing communities. For example, the importance of fishing to the coastal community, changes to the cultural role of fishing to the community, kinship and family, changes in fishing effort and stocks as a result of management decisions, and communication networks and issues. This information is obtained by creating long-form profiles. Yet creating long-form profiles is time-consuming and expensive. A study at Oregon State University looked at an innovative way to obtain this important information. Long-form community profiles were recently completed for Port Orford, Newport, and Garibaldi, Oregon through a collaborative project involving fishing community members and Oregon State University social scientists. These profiles could then supplement the NOAA short-form fishing community profiles through the addition of fishing community's perspectives. The desired outcome was to have better social information on fishing communities/dat​a for use in fisheries management. The new methodology developed in this project of utilizing community members as researchers was done in an attempt to: 1) produce this type of information in a timelier manner and 2) to get to sensitive information that some community members are reticent to share with academics. Project team members collected ethnographic data, with the community members conducting the bulk of the interviews. This was a success in that community members helped to distribute the work allowing the interview phase to be completed more quickly. It also was a success in helping us to access both the informants and the sensitive information. Lastly, it was a success in that the project produced long-form profiles which include a depth of information that was previously unavailable. However the new, long-form profiles still face the challenge of getting decision makers to use this product. Why? Because fisheries managers and policy makers are already overwhelmed with a large amount of information. There is also a lack of understanding and general confusion over how to use social science information in management decisions. This paper will discuss the community profiles and the information they contain as well as discuss possible ways to transform the profiles into products more easily used by decision makers."
