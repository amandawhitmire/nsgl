10,Abstract:,"Use this comprehensive species module for an in-depth understanding of knotweed. Modules include a comprehensive species guide, a species-​at-​a-​glance fact sheet, a related lesson plan, suggested activies, comprehension questions, and videos and related on-line resources. Knotweeds are a group of closely related invasive plants from Asia. Knotweeds are very tall plants that can grow to over three meters with bamboo-like hollow stems and heart-shaped or lance-shaped leaves. They spread quickly and form tall, dense thickets. They dominate stream banks, sides of roads, gardens, and other sunny, moist, and disturbed sites."
