15,Abstract:,"The domestication of the Pacific whiting fishery has resulted in an opportunity for significant cooperation between the fishing industry and research institutions. ""Merluccius productus"" has a number of behavioral and intrinsic characteristics that make controlling product quality a challenging problem. These characteristics include high recruitment variability, complex migration patterns, a relatively soft flesh, a fat layer associated with rancidity, the presence of myxosporidean parasites, and high levels of protease enzymes in the muscle tissue. These characteristics affect fishing practices, methods of processing, and market decisions. This workshop was designed to cover a wide range of important topics in the Pacific whiting fisheries, including food technology, product quality, marketing, biology, and fisheries policy. The articles here are intended mainly for people associated with the seafood processing and marketing industries. Their purpose is to provide information that readers can use to develop profitable quality-​assurance programs and improve market conditions. The following papers are included in this publication: 1.
