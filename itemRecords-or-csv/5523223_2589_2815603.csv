11,Abstract:,"In April 1987, the federal Minerals Management Service (MMS), the agency that manages the offshore petroleum industry, issued its latest five-year plan containing a proposal to lease tracts for oil and gas development off Washington and Oregon in 1992, the first such lease sale since 1964. In tackling the enormous subject of offshore petroleum, this article, adapted from an Ocean Resources Assessment Program report, focuses on what appear to be its major potential impacts on society and the environment in coastal Washington and Oregon, and on major areas of uncertainty that will need to be resolved. It also highlights findings that do not conform to the conventional wisdom that offshore petroleum development would offer the states economic benefits, but would also pose a serious environmental threat. The major potential impacts are identified as (1) a possible `boom-and-bust' cycle in the coastal economy and (2) the possiblity of a large oil spill. Both are effects to which the northwest coast is particularly vulnerable. The conventional wisdom is defied by findings that the northwest economy appears to have little to gain from offshore petroleum production. Under current conditions, the additional risk of large oil spills posed by offshore development would probably be only a small fraction of the existing risk posed by transportation of oil into, within, and past northwest waters."
