9,,"Calcasieu Lake is a brackish, open-bay system located in Cameron and Calcasieu parishes, Louisiana. It is used by charter boat operators, recreational fishermen, and supports oyster, crab, and shrimp harvesting. The lake and deepwater shipping channel are also critical to the chemical, petroleum, and shipping industries. In August and September 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the infrastructure and livelihoods of Gulf Coast residents. A large portion of the damage occurred in the Louisiana Coastal Zone and had a profound impact on people dependent upon the state's commercial and recreational fisheries. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez issued a formal fishery resource disaster declaration for Louisiana and Texas following Hurricane Rita on October 4, 2005 (NOAA 2005). Hurricane Rita, the fourth strongest storm on record, ravaged southwestern Louisiana on September 24, 2005, impacting, and in some cases demolishing recreational and commercial boats and gear, homes, automobiles and personal property, as well as industrial structures, solvents and supplies. Based on early U.S. Corps of Engineers models, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita generated an estimated 22.5 million tons (56 million cubic yards) of debris. While terrestrial storm debris was addressed by numerous local, state and federal agencies, there remained a tremendous need to address the persistent hurricane-â€‹driven marine debris. As vessels left derelict from the hurricanes deteriorate, they create fields of marine debris (NOAA 2006)."
