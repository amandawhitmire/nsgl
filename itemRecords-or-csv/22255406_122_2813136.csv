16,Abstract:,"This is one of six videos about how aquarists with Oregon Sea Grant care for animals at the Hatfield Marine Science Center's Visitor Center in Newport, Oregon. This video explains how coral is propagated by snipping pieces from larger corals. Coral fragmentation is important because it allows hobbyists and professionals to grow and share their own corals instead of collecting wild coral from reefs around the world. Oregon Sea Grant operates the Visitor Center, which features interactive exhibits and attracts more than 150,000 visitors each year. It is home to Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program for K-12 students and teachers."
