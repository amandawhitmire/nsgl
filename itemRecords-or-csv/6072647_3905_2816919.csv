14,Abstract:,"The texture of arrowtooth flounder, an underutilized fish species abundant in Alaska, degrades during cooking, a phenomenon that has been associated with proteolysis. Interest in safer fish products by high-pressure processing (HPP) is increasing. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of HPP treatments at 400 and 600 MPa for 1 and 5 min on the mechanical and functional properties of heat-induced fish gels obtained from arrowtooth flounder fish paste. Three thermal treatments of pressure-​treated and control samples were evaluated: 90 deg. C for 15 min (kamaboko); 40 deg. C for 30 min plus 90 deg. C for 15 min (setting); 60 deg. C for 30 min plus 90 deg. C for 15 min (modori). Changes in texture profile analysis parameters, water holding capacity, sodium do-decyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic pattern and color parameters were determined. HPP improved the mechanical properties of heat-induced gels. Proteolysis of fish gels when they were incubated at 60 deg. C was not inhibited by HPP. The results obtained suggest distinct mechanisms of protein aggregation for pressure- and heat-induced fish gels."
