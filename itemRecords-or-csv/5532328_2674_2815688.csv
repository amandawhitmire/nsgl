15,Abstract:,"Marine lipids, particularly the fish-derived oils, have received considerable attention recently for their numerous purported health benefits to humans. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of 18 to 22 carbons with a carbon-carbon double bond located at the third carbon from the methyl terminus, known as ""omega""-3 fats, are generally believed to be responsible for these beneficial effects. This paper summarizes efforts on the survey and chemotaxonomic description of new algal species for eicosanoid-type natural products, with the major objective of providing evidence for a widespread 12-lipoxygenase activity in red algae."
