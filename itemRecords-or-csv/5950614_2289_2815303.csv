10,Abstract:,"In this essay an anthropologist reports on some of the traditional resources used over the past few millennia at the mouth of the Coquille River in Oregon. It includes technical findings from analysis of faunal remains � names and numbers of bones from specific groups of animals � at an important village site at the mouth of the river, as well as reflections on how these data apply to developing bodies of literature about traditional resources."
