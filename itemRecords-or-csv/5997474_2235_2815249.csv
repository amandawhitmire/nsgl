11,Abstract:,"Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) were produced against the myxosporean parasite, Ceratomyxa shasta, and were characterized by indirect immunofluoresce​nt techniques, western blot analysis, and immunoelectron microscopy. The resulting Mabs reacted specifically with the trophozoite and sporoblast stages of the parasite, but not with the mature spore, indicating that certain antigens are stage-specific.
