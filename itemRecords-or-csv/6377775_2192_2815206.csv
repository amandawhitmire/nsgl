13,Abstract:,"The development of shelf hypoxia and/or anoxia is a common feature of many eastern boundary current systems where enhanced rates of export production and cross-shelf transport of oxygen-poor waters serve as key determinants of ecosystem oxygen budgets. A number of studies have recently identified and described the rapid expansion and intensification of hypoxia, including the novel emergence of inner-shelf anoxia in the California Current large marine ecosystem (CCLME). While the onset of hypoxia can perturb coastal food webs and fisheries, our understanding of impacts to the system are limited by availability of baseline ecological information and coupled hydrographic and biological datasets, and the difficulty of quantifying biological responses to episodic events at depth. Through analyses of video footage from archived and new Remotely Operated Vehicle surveys, we tracked changes in both oxygen and community structure of benthic fishes and invertebrates for 11 years at a rocky reef on Oregon's inner-shelf (ca. 50m depth). Preliminary analyses reveal both acute impacts on fish community structure and their potential for recovery following seasonal hypoxia events. Characterizatio​n of invertebrate community structure prior to and following the onset of anoxia also revealed patterns of taxa-specific sensitivity to oxygen deficit stress in-situ, and rates of recolonization and population recovery. These findings provide new insights into the resilience of rocky reef communities as well as trajectories of community reorganization in response to oceanographical​ly induced oxygen changes."
