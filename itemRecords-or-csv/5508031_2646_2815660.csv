11,Abstract:,"FAn index of potential bloom conditions for phytoplankton in surface layers of an inland seawater system is needed. Satellite imagery is a useful tool for classifying radiance regimes in open coastal waters, say 400 km to within 20 km of shore, but it does not work well for inland waters. Aerial high-resolution photography offers a promising alternative in quasi-synoptic surveys of phytoplankton signals from inland water systems. A model has been designed relating radiance emitted by surface layer waters in inland sounds to the potential of phytoplankton bloom intensity; it is calibrated to conditions that exist at the beginning of the spring and fall seasons, the times of transition between winter and summer during which the intense phytoplankton blooms associated with noxious red tides tend to occur."
