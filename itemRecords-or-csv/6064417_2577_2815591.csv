9,Abstract:,"The two lectures on this disc were among the memorable presentations by distinguished individuals during the John Byrne Lecture series years 1998-2006. The series is named for the former Oregon State University President, Dean of Oceanography, and Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. So it is fitting that the series, on occasion, highlighted the research of OSU faculty who address important marine topics, including the two men recorded here. The lectures by coastal geologist Paul Komar (2006) and marine mammal researcher Bruce Mate (2002) are presented just as they were recorded, uncut and unedited; all the slides and other media used by the presenters are shown. Sea Grant and COAS sponsored the Byrne lectures to excite broad interest in current issues in marine and atmospheric sciences, particularly on themes of resources, policy, and communicating science."
