13,Abstract:,"In the present study, the authors examined the tissues of IHNV survivor fish for truncated particles and attempted to determine their biological function. Through techniques of explant culture, plaque assay, immunosorbent electron microscopy, and nested reverse transcriptase, they have confirmed earlier observations that the virus does persist in survivors of IHNV infection and that superinfection of the tissues of survivor fish results in the production of truncated particles, a finding consistent with a model that postulates that defective interfering particles are mediators of virus persistence."
