10,Abstract:,"Catch distributions for most fisheries where the stock is limiting are skewed such that the largest number of fishers take the smallest catches. Oregon salmon fishing and bottom trawling illustrate that catch distributions become even more skewed with increasing resource scarcity. Increases in the number fishing and improvements in technical efficiency contribute to the creation of a distributional pattern in which a very few fishermen are very successful, whereas most other fishermen take increasingly smaller shares of the resource. Fishery management rules that apply equally to each participant in the fishery result in greater relative advantage for some producers and increase inequality."
