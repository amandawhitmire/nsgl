10,Abstract:,"The Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Program is the centerpiece of continuing efforts to preserve and restore salmon and steelhead runs in the Northwest. The author examines the directives of the Northwest Power Act which authorized the program and evaluates the first three-​and-​a-​half years of program implementation, including amendments adopted by the Northwest Power Planning Council in 1984, 1985, and 1986. He also surveys several impending threats to successful implementation, ranging from constitutional challenges to the Council, to electric power exports to California, to widespread reluctance on the part of federal water project operators and regulators to carry out various program provisions. These threats, along with the Northwest Power Planning Council's reluctance to approve increased fish passage protection in 1986, indicate an uncertain future for the program and its restoration goals."
