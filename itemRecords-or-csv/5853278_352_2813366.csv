12,Abstract:,"Oregon is renowned not only for the natural beauty of its coastline but also for its enlightened tradition of publicly owned and protected beaches. This illustrated guide offers a north-to-south tour of Oregon's Pacific edge, with extensive mile-by-mile coverage of scenic Highway 101. It describes natural and scenic public use areas such as beaches, parks, forests, campgrounds, and hiking and equestrian trails, as well as up-to-date information on outdoor recreations like angling, boating, whale watching, golfing, surfing, and cycling."
