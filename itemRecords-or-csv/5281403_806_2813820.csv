11,Abstract:,"Shear-induced circulation and sedimentation of cohesive particles in rectangular marina basins are simulated using finite difference and finite element techniques, respectively. The solutions consider the effects of varying basin length, basin width, entrance width, entrance placement, number of entrances, suspended sediment concentration at the entrance, entrance boundary velocity, and strength of transverse dispersion. The results are presented in graphical form to facilitate the estimation of basin-averaged velocities and sedimentation rates for a variety of simple marina configurations.​ Slotta and Nobel's (1977) basin-flushing guidelines are recommended for use jointly with these results to warn of undesirable flushing characteristics​. The shear-driven vortex circulation may be enhanced by increasing the relative entrance width or decreasing either the basin width or length."
