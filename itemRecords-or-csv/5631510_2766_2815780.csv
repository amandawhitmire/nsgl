13,Abstract:,"Commercial interest in refrigerated foods has expanded rapidly in response to consumer demand for convenient and fresh-like products. Development of technologies to design foods with extended refrigerated shelf-life is limited by wide temperature ranges as food marketing extends from producer to consumer. Processors of refrigerated products are interested in models for the extent of the microbial lag phase as its end reflects the possibility of a pathogen beginning to multiply in a given food, thus increasing consumer risks. They are also interested in the multiplication of spoilage microorganisms in the exponential phase which would reduce product quality. In this study, numerical and statistical procedures based on pseudo-zero for the lag and first order reaction kinetics for the exponential growth phase were developed to analyze non-isothermal microbial spoilage. Arrhenius model parameters and their accuracy were estimated for a mixture of ""Pseudomonas fluorescens"", ""Staphylococcus aureus"" and ""Achromobacter lwoffi"" growing in a seafood model."
