9,Abstract:,"Congress has mandated that all researchers who receive federal funds from NOAAâ€™s Office of Sea Grant must publish research results and distribute them to as wide an audience as possible. In addition, these results must be reported to the federal government, which maintains a library of all Sea Grant-funded publications at the University of Rhode Island. This publication discusses how you can meet the publication requirements of the Office of Sea Grant as easily and efficiently as possible."
