11,Abstract:,"Refrigerated seawater is a fish stowage system that uses mechanical refrigeration to chill a catch. Benefits are that (1) it chills quickly; (2) it has a low holding temperature; (3) labor requirements are lower; (4) it uses no ice, thus reduces expenses; and (5) its machinery can also be used in brine freezing. The drawbacks to this system are (1) its high initial expense, (2) the monitoring it requires, (3) and the instability it sometimes causes in a vessel not designed for a flood-hold operation. In addition, dead fish absorb salt from the water, and some species may partially spoil."
