10,Abstract:,"NJSGC’s ongoing mission is to promote the beneficial use of New Jersey’s marine and coastal resources through research, education, and outreach. From the Spring issue of the quarterly newsletter of COASTodian: With less than 60 days until Memorial Day Weekend, thoughts of beach-going and summer vacation begin to creep into our thoughts. While summer is a time for relaxation for many, it is a busy time at the Consortium. Over the next few months, thousands of students and campers will make their way to Sandy Hook for NJSGC-led field trips and scout programs. In 2016, more than 20,000 K-12 visitors came to take advantage of the ideal outdoor learning space available here on the Hook. Our extension agents will be working with their partners on numerous projects from installing rain gardens and other green infrastructure projects to helping New Jersey's shellfish industry diversify and grow. Off the Hook, our researchers continue to conduct New Jersey Sea Grant-funded projects on everything from coastal resilience to healthy coastal ecosystems and sea level rise. Take a scroll through the Spring edition of Coastodian to see all of the exciting things coming up. In the Summer COASTodian issue: Communicating climate sciences, learning more about the origins of striped bass, and engaging youth in summer camp experiences are just some of the interesting topics covered in this edition of our quarterly newsletter. You’ll also find out which popular shore town snagged top honors in NJSGC’s annual ""Favorite Beaches"" poll! In the Autumn edition of the COASTodian, learn more about ongoing projects, current advances in aquaculture education, the importance of understanding storm surge, and why three members of the NJSGC staff recently traveled to Astoria, Oregon. We’ve also dedicated a section to mark the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Sandy, including details on Monmouth County’s High Water Mark Initiative."
