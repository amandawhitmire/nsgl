10,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHVN) belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae and infects salmonids, usually causing a fatal disease. The complete nucleotide sequence of the IHNV nucleocapsid gene has been determined using cDNA clones of genomic and messenger RNAs. Comparison of the IHNV N protein coding sequence with other rhabdoviral N genes shows some homologies at the amino acid level which indicates the possible evolutionary relationship of the N proteins. The determination of the nucleotide sequences of IHNV genes and intergenic regions will be useful for studying the mechanisms of rhabdoviral transcription and replication."
