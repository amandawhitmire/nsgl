10,Abstract:,"Achieving proper levels of salt and moisture in the production of smoked fish is a critical step in preservation. Salt analysis by official methods can be expensive and time consuming and requires skilled technicians. However, a good estimate of salt and moisture can be obtained using a much simpler (and less accurate) test which relies on ""Chloride titrators"" and a drying (or microwave) oven. This technique is accurate enough for quality control purposes, requires relatively inexpensive equipment, and is to easy learn. However, to be sure smoked products meet regulatory requirements, samples should be submitted to qualified laboratories as necessary. The equipment and procedures listed in this report offer alternatives which generally trade accuracy for time, convenience, or expense. The most accurate procedure uses a drying oven for moisture analysis. The quickest procedure uses a microwave oven and special glass filter pads. A summary of equipment needed for the procedure requiring the least investment is shown on page 6 of this report."
