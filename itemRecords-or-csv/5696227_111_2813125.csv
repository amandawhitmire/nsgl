13,Abstract:,"Oregon's coast is a beautiful but sometimes hazardous place to boat. Shoals, bar entrances, river and tidal currents, ocean swells,and winds often create dangerous conditions for vessels of all sizes. Pleasant seas and fair weather can change quickly on the open ocean and across the bar. The latest revision of this popular handbook includes general boating safety information, from how to identify buoys and storm signals to the dangers of boating too close to larger vessels, along with specific information and maps describing 20 separate coastal bars, bays, and rivers."
