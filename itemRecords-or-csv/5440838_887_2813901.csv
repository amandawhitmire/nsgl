10,Abstract:,"A mixed-species yield-​per-​recruit model is applied to examine the effects of implementing various management policies on flatfish fishery yield in Oregon. If an efficiency-​oriented policy were adopted, the current minimum mesh size regulation of 114 mm would be optimal. However, if effort is left unrestricted, or if a maximization strategy were adopted, a larger mesh size would result in greater volume yields. Optimal mesh size is more sensitive to the management policy selected than it is to either variations in recruitment or to costs associated with fishing. If economic considerations become more important in formulating management policy, greater gains could be achieved by limiting effort than by altering mesh size regulations. As the management policy becomes less restrictive of effort, the influence of mesh size on fishery output increases."
