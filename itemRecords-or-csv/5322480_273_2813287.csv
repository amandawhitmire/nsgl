16,Abstract:,"The Anadromous Fish Law Memo is an aperiodic publication of the Lewis and Clark Law School's Natural Resources Law Institute (NRLI) and is distributed by the OSU Extension Service's Sea Grant Marine Advisory Program. It provides a series of reports on the laws and institutions affecting the Columbia River's anadromous fishery and are designed to serve two purposes. First, as a mechanism to report to the public the results of NRLI's more detailed legal analyses. Second, through the inclusion in each issue of ""Fish Law Briefs"" providing a format in which the pubic may be apprised of the numerous on-going developments impacting upon the Columbia's salmon and steelhead. Cover articles in these issues include: Funding and other implementation challenges to the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Program; Oregon's wild fish management policy: large promises, few deliveries; Supreme Court, Ninth Circuit decisions curb FERC hydroelectric authority: good news for fish and wildlife; Regional council proposes 5-year action plan and other amendments to the Columbia Basin Program; Ninth Circuit orders an EIS on BPA's power sale contracts."
