10,Abstract:,"For many people, a marine career conjures up images of scientists working on ships far out at sea, marine mammalogists studying whales and dolphins, and scuba divers exploring the depths of the ocean. But the marine field actually offers a much wider variety of interesting and challenging work. Marine careers can be found in state and federal agencies, colleges and universities, and various industries, such as oil, gas, and seafood. Deciding on a career within marine studies involves defining interests and aptitudes. Marine work is often conducted outside, in or on the water. Furthermore, it frequently requires working under adverse weather conditions. It is often necessary to work after hours and perform repetitive tasks. Spending long hours on a computer is usually a given."
