8,Abstract:,"Care must be taken in establishing the statistical significance of correlations and regression coefficients in analyses involving oceanographic variables and post-smolt salmon survival. The effects of environmental factors on salmonids may vary widely among species and locations. Another factor complicating analyses is that interpretation of computed correlations and regressives is compromised by the fact that the surmised important variables are often themselves not independent. Identification of the causes of Pacific salmonid population fluctuations will take a concerted, cooperative reaearch effort, but it appears to be worth the cost."
