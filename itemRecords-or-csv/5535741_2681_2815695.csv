12,Abstract:,"Fishing capacity measures the capability to catch fish. Capacity utilization is the actual effectiveness in catching fish; the ratio of catch to capacity. The factors comprising a fleet's capacity are the number and size of vessels, the technical efficiency of those vessels, and the time commitment of fishermen. Knowing the capacity utilization of a fleet is critical for evaluating management alternatives, regardless of whether fisheries are managed with fleet controls or with individual controls. The measurement of capacity utilization is illustrated here with the Oregon bottom trawl fishery between 1976 and 1985, during which time capacity first quadrupled and then declined by 30%. Capacity measurement is necessary to assess management-​induced changes in controlled fisheries. Controlling capacity requires addressing all the elements associated with capacity growth. Examination of the components of fleet capacity reveals an array of management options."
