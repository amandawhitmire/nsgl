11,Abstract:,"For millennia Celilo Falls was the great Indian fishery on the mid-Columbia River, and it drew Indians there from throughout the West to trade for salmon. But in 1957 the federal government began operation of a giant hydroelectric dam at The Dalles that drowned Celilo Falls and ended the fishery there. Through a combination of rare historic films and photographs, ""Celilo Falls and the Remaking of the Co- lumbia River"" provides a glimpse of the life at Celilo as it once was and considers the cultural, social, and political forces that brought about its end, signaling a new era in the relationship between people and nature."
