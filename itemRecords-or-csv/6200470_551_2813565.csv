12,Abstract:,"This newsletter was designed as a publication for Oregon commercial fishermen. The goal is to include information about what's happening in Oregon's commercial fishing industry such as new boats in the fleets, vessels under construction, new or modified gear and equipment being used, new ideas being tested, etc. Coverage of commercial fishing activities on the entire coasts will be a regular feature of all future newsletters. The newsletter will also be used as a vehicle to increase communications between commercial fishermen in the state. Topics include: Silver salmon tagging program; gear; coastal upwelling study; buoys; location of towboat lanes; navigational charts."
