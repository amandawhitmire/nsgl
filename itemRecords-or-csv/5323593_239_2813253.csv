13,Abstract:,"The College of Oceanography, Oregon State University, conducted three cruises, June 4-28, July 9- August 3 and September 1-15 in 1984, to study the distribution, abundance, migration, growth and feeding habits of juvenile salmonids during their first summer in the ocean. This is the fourth year we have had a series of cruises during the summer months and the sixth year that we have sampled the Oregon and Washington coast during June. This July we also sampled off northern California and the west coast of' Vancouver Island. The purpose of this report is to describe the sampling area and methods used for the 1984 cruises and to present some preliminary results."
