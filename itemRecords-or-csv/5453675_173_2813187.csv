11,Abstract:,"Fishermen alone dump or lose more than 350 million pounds of nonbiodegradablâ€‹e material per year. The consequences are bad for both economies and wildlife. Solving the plastics problem will require legislation and new technologies that perfect biodegradable plastics and invent acceptable alternatives. Most of all, it will require education. Sea Grant's Advisory Service has been active in this effort. Resource materials on marine debris include slide shows, posters, radio spots, brochures, videos, extensive bibliographies, and a clipping service. Many marine extension programs have helped organize beach cleanups in their states. This article details a number of such Sea Grant activities."
