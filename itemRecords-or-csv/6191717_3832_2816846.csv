11,Abstract:,"Hear and see what your neighbors, town officials, and climate experts have to say about sea-level rise, coastal flooding, and erosion; what it means to you; and what you can do about it. Included are the following segments: (1) changing climate, changing coast: science and economics; (2) how shoreline property may be affected; (3) how coastal communities may be affected; and (4) what individuals and communities can do to protect themselves."
