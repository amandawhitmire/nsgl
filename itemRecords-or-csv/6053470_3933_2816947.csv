12,Abstract:,"Limited techniques are currently available for the determination of sexual maturity and gender in Chinook salmon. These techniques, which include ultrasound and the use of an endoscope, are either invasive or untested at the early stages required for this project. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been widely applied in the food industry and shows potential for application in biological systems. Previous studies verified that Short Wavelength Near Infrared (SW-NIR) could detect differences between egg and testis tissues. In this study, SW-NIR spectroscopy and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) were used to develop a non-invasive method to classify females versus males and mature versus immature salmonids."
