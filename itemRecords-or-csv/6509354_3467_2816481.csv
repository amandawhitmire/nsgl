9,Abstract:,"This report is the result of study and examination by the Neskowin Coastal Hazards Committee (NCHC). The NCHC is a Tillamook County ad hoc committee formed to respond to the present erosion threat from the ocean in the County and to the beach and community of Neskowin. Since its inception in Fall 2009, the committee has met monthly, with subcommittee meetings more frequently. There have been public meetings to garner feedback and many sessions with experts to gain input, all of which have contributed to this report."
