9,Abstract:,"In this case study, a policymaker on northwest salmon provides an insider's view of the struggles one community has faced in attempting to restore endangered salmon. The study focuses on one of the first watershed programs in the Columbia Basin, the Grande Ronde, where the politics involve complex issues of science, law, and community values. In both its successes and failures, the Grande Ronde has lessons for lawgivers and policymakers, for agency professionals, tribal leaders, and local government officials."
