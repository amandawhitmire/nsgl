9,Abstract:,"In recent years, many traditional U.S. fisheries have experienced substantial declines in harvest rates. As a result, commercial fishermen are beginning to explore new fisheries and fishing concepts. Recent trends have forced many vessels to move into underutilized fisheries which are usually characterized by high volumes and low ex-vessel prices. The dogfish shark (""Squalus acanthias"") represents one underutilized species which is currently harvested in New England and may offer potential for commercial development in the mid-Atlantic region. The development of a viable dogfish will depend upon several efficient and economically sound harvesting methods, processing of quality products, and the development of viable foreign and domestic markets."
