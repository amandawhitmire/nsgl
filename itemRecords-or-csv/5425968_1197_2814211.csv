11,Abstract:,"The Pacific weathervane scallop ""Pecten (Patinopecten) caurinus"" occurs along the west coast of North America from south Alaska to San Francisco. In Alaska, commercial quantities are reported to exist only around Kodiak and Yakutat. In 1981 large beds of ""P. caurinus"" located off Coos Bay attracted commercial fishermen. By the year's end, nearly twice the 1981 Alaskan harvest had been harvested from off the Oregon coast. The scallop beds were depleted in one year and the commercial exploitation of the species has substantially decreased. A sampling program was implemented to gather information on size and age distribution of ""P. caurinus"". The annual spawning cycle was estimated from the results of this program."
