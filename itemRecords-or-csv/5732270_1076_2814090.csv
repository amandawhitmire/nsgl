11,Abstract:,"Larval abundance and settlement of red sea urchins (Strongylocentr​otus franciscanus) and the purple sea urchins (S. purpuratus) was found to be variable over a two year period on the southern Oregon coast. A method of estimating age of early juvenile sea urchins was developed, based on temperature-​dependent developmental rates of specific juvenile traits. This method was used to correlate sea urchin settlement to several relaxation events during the summer upwelling season. See digital for the rest of the abstract."
