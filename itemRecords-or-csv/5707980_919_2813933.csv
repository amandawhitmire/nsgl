12,Abstract:,"The Pacific coastal zone provides habitats for a great diversity of living things, from the fish and shellfish Pacific peoples consume to fragile ecosystems that can be destroyed by environmental change as people dredge the waters, clear mangrove swamps, and drain wetlands for building. Developed for young people from 13 to 17, this new atlas will appeal to older and younger readers as well. It defines the coastal zone and describes the different kinds of coasts found in and along the Pacific. With a clear, concise text and many illustrations, the atlas presents the environmental and human dimensions of life along the Pacific Rim."
