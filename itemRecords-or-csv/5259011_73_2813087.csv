17,Abstract:,"The ABC Book of Water represents a cooperative effort between the Sea Grant and Elementary Education Programs at Oregon State University. Our purpose in initiating this project was twofold. The first part was to involve as many elementary and middle school students as possible in identifying, researching, describing, and illustrating some of the many concepts associated with Sea Grant. The second part of our goal was to provide an additional means of further developing basic skills in reading and language arts through combining and integrating these skills, along with those from art, in the composition of an ABC Book of Water by individual or small groups of students. Sea Grant, as our book illustrates, is more than just the study of our Pacific coastline and the ocean. It does involve the ocean, bays, and estuaries, but it also includes the rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds of inland regions."
