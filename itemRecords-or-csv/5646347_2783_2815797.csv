10,Abstract:,"Oyster larvae have the endogenous ability to utilize bacteria as a carbon source. The objective of this study was to address two questions on the importance of the bacterial carbon contribution to bivalve larvae: (1) what is the potential contribution of bacterial carbon toward the total metabolic requirements of larvae during different stages of larval development, and (2) how does the bacterial carbon compare with the algal carbon contribution to straight-hinged bivalve larvae when both food items are provided under the same conditions and carbon biomasses?"
