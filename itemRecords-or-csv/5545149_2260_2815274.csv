12,Abstract:,"Two species of anadromous trout are native to the Pacific coast drainages of North America: ""Oncorhynchus c. clarki"" (formerly ""Salmo c. clarki""), the coastal cutthroat trout, and ""O. mykiss"" (formerly ""Salmo gairdneri"" and ""S. mykiss""), the steelhead and Kamchatkan trout. Because these two trout species are sympatric over much of their range, behavioral and ecological differences are of special interest. This paper describes the distribution and movements, age and size distribution, sex ratios, and food habits of juveniles of these species in coastal waters off Oregon and Washington, discusses their differences, and speculates on their adaptive significance."
