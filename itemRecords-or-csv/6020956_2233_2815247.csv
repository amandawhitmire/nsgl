12,Abstract:,"Two approaches to liquid cell culture of marine macraalgae were used: protoplast isolation of Porphyra and gametophyte culture of Laminaria saccharina. A bubble column bioreactor was designed to cultivate photosynthetic macroalgal liquid cell cultures. Bubble column bioreactor cultivation was compared to static flask and immobilized bead systems in terms of growth rates of Laminaria saccharina gametophytes. Also, three levels of an inorganic carbon source (0 g/L, 0.34 g/L, 0.64 g/L bicarbonate) was compared on the basis of growth rate in the bubble column bioreactor system. Protoplast isolation of Porphyra was achieved with a yield of 1.96 +/- 0.81 x 10^6 viable cells/ml-gram fresh weight(1s, n=5). Ideal digestion conditions were obtained by using Aplysia enzyme extract, 23 deg C, diffuse light, 2 wt% cellulysin, and 70 rpm agitation. Growth rates in the static flask cultures were zero order with a rate of 0.079 ug Chi a/ml-day. The bubble column bioreactor showed first order growth with a specific rate of 0.282 +/- 0.013 day (1s, n=2) and a final dry cell density of 822.5 +/- 38.9 mg/L Gametophytes in alginate beads showed no growth. Each of the comparison systems were run at 340 mg/L bicarbonate carbon source, 16L:8D photoperiod, 2500 Lux light intensity, in GP2 artificial seawater medium. Bicarbonate levels of 0, 340 and 680 mg/L gave doubling times of 2.77, 2.47 and 3.40 days respectively in a bubble column bioreactor. Initial biacrbonate level was deemed non- limiting to growth because of diffusion of carbon dioxide te-and from the growth medium into the sparging gas."
