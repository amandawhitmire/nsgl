12,Abstract:,"Environmental conflicts arise over the spatial allocation of coastal and marine resources. These conflicts share common traits with land-based resource conflicts, yet are distinct and these differences require special consideration. The tools that are emerging for preventing or mitigating marine conflicts as part of marine spatial planning include stakeholder consultations, decision-​support software models, ocean zoning, regulation, negotiated settlements, incentive instruments, and others. This paper will:  explain existing tools, and evaluate their effectiveness from multiple perspectives,  examine lessons learned,  present selected case studies of recent and contemporary marine conflict, and  discuss what other approaches or combined approaches might be effective to anticipate and address marine spatial conflict."
