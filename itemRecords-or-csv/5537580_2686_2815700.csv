12,Abstract:,"Surprisingly few studies have been conducted to examine the onset of steroidogenesis in the differentiating teleostean gonad. The objective of the work described here was to elucidate the possible involvement of the endocrine system in the process of sexual differentiation in fish by evaluating the development of sex steroid profiles in coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") through the period of sexual differentiation and by correlating hormonal events with gonadal development."
