10,Abstract:,"This DVD presents a visually and scientifically exciting perspective on a part of our world that has never been visualized quite this way before. On this disk, you'll discover: animated, computerized flyovers of the nearshore Oregon continental margin and offshore Oregon in its northeast Pacific setting; a detailed, animated flyover of the Astoria Canyon, a fascinating section of the Oregon margin; a real underwater video view of part of the Astoria Canyon; a video glimpse of another unusual part of the margin near Newport that shows the venting of methane gas out of the ocean floor; an interview with Chris Goldfinger, the Oregon State University researcher who develops flyovers; and a special bonus: ""Astoria Canyon,"" a half- hour special presentation of Oregon Public Broadcasting's ""Oregon Field Guide."""
