13,Abstract:,"The goal of this study was to perform a metabolic flux analysis on halogenated monoterpene biosynthesis within ""Ochtodes secundiramea"" microplantlets. To accomplish this, the authors developed a 'bromine free' cell line of ""O. secundiramea"" microplantlets where halogenation was temporarily disabled but myrcene biosynthesis was still enabled. This cell line was cultivated within an airlift photobioreactor under nutrient medium perfusion. Halogenated monoterpene biosynthesis was turned on by adding bromide and vanadate (a bromoperoxidase co-factor) to the perfusion medium. From these experiments, they determined the effects of bromide and vanadate delivery on the metabolic flux of each metabolite within the bioreaction network."
