11,Abstract:,"Oregon State University completed its sixth granting year showing signs of maturing as a Sea Grant College. Both continuity and responsive evolution were major program goals during the year—as they still are. Several benchmarks—invo​lvement of Oregon marine industries, increasing support from state and local sources, cooperation with state and federal marine resource agencies, rigorous program review by advisory councils, peers, agencies and industries, and recognized achievements from projects—all point to a coming of age. At the same time, other indicators—insu​fficient funding, increasing requests for services, emerging technical areas that should be involved in the Sea Grant College Program, and the need to conduct more fundamental research—point to the long-term planning and performance necessary before Sea Grant reaches full efficiency and maturity. Our orientation is people and their linkage to the sea. We are concerned with helping people use ocean resources for economic gain, recreation, and aesthetics. We are concerned with developing an understanding and appreciation of how to live with the ocean and how to manage the coastal zone. This annual report is for 1973-1974."
