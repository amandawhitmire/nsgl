12,Abstract:,"During the summer of 1969 the Civil Engineering Department at Oregon State University measured tidal elevations and current velocities in the Yaquina, Alsea, and Siletz estuaries. This report essentially presents a summary and an overview of the data collected on the tidal and physical characteristics of the estuaries. Detailed analyses of these data and comparisons with mathematical models will follow in a later report. It is hoped that the information presented herein will prove useful to those involved in planning and managing the use of our estuaries."
