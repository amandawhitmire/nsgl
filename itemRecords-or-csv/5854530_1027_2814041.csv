The goal of this newsletter is to provide readers with a reasonably comprehensive picture of ocean and coastal policy developments across the wide spectrum of ocean interests-from federal and state agencies, ocean industries, non-â€‹governmental organizations, the U.S. Congress, academia, to relevant aspects of the international scene. It is a joint effort of the Center for the Study of Marine Policy, the National Ocean Services, NOAA, the Ocean Governance Study Group, and the Delaware Sea Grant College Program. Articles include: The National Ocean Conference: YOTO's ""Finest Hour""? By Don Walsh. Stratton Roundtable, by Daniel J. Basta. And, The Heinz Center's Year of the Ocean Workshops, by Charles Bookman and John H. Heinz III. Other topics include: New Push to Ratify The Law of the Sea Treaty, M.J.
