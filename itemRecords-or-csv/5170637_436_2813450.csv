10,Abstract:,"This report summarizes data on planktonic fish larvae collected from 2 to 111km off Yaquina Bay, Oregon during a 1 1/2 year survey from January 1971 to August 1972. Data came from 287 bongo net plankton samples which contained 23,578 fish larvae in 90 taxonomic groups, 78 identified at the species level. Data on larval fish occurrences, given as number of larvae under 10m2 sea surface, are presented for each of the 90 taxa separately and for all fish larvae combined. Hydrographic data (temperature at Om, 10m, and the bottom or 140m and salinity at Om and the bottom or 140m) collected at the same time and location are also presented. All data are listed in relation to distance from the coast and cruise date. Information on relative abundance, inshore-​offshore distribution trends and seasonal occurrences of larval fishes can be readily derived and compared with the hydrographic data,"
