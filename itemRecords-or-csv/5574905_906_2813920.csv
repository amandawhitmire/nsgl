12,Abstract:,"Pressure has been growing for congress to pass legislation establishing mandatory seafood inspection. Whatever form seafood legislation may finally take, it will almost certainly require food processors to establish safety assurance programs based on the rational and systematic approaches of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) concept. This publication explains HACCP and explores its applications in the seafood industry of the Pacific Northwest. The symptoms, characteristicsâ€‹, and prevention of the most important pathogens associated with seafoods are described, and seafood processors are provided with suggested models for smoking fish and processing cooked and picked crab and cooked and peeled shrimp."
