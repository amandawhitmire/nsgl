12,Abstract:,"The capacity of aquatic organisms to perform necessary life functions (e.g., grow, resist disease, reproduce, tolerate thermal extremes) is ultimately prescribed by their genetic constitution. As such, each individual can be thought of as possessing a potential performance capacity, and the nature of the variation in individual performance capacities describes the potential performance capacity of each population or stock. This paper presents a philosophical framework for a symposium on aquaculture and water quality, premised on the performance capacity paradigm, and suggests that any fish cultural condition when less than optimal will reduce performance. In essence, any suboptimal environmental factor that is toxicological, causes a stress response, or otherwise results in an energetic load will reduce the net capacity of the cultured organism to express its genetically established potential of performing activities important to fish culturists."
