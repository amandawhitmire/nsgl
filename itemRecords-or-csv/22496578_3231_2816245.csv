10,Abstract:,"This website documents living with flooding in the lower Tillamook Bay basin on the Oregon coast. Tidal-​influenced flooding is a natural part of life for residents of Tillamook County. Rain events raise the county's seven river systems, five of which converge in Tillamook Bay. Coastal storm surges and high tides can push in large amounts of seawater. On this website, you will find information about the mitigation projects the people of Tillamook have implemented to reduce flooding, pictures documenting the 1999 Tillamook City flood, and a digital archive of flood-related articles that illustrate the ongoing conversation surrounding flooding in Tillamook."
