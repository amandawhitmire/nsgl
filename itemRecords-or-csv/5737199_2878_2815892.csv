10,Abstract:,"Waves and currents in the littoral zone combine to produce a transport of beach sediments. Interest in this transport developed primarily during the past century in response to increased construction of jetties and breakwaters in the nearshore, structures which interrupt this transport. The build-up of a beach along the updrift side of a structure together with erosion in its downdrift direction not only pose problems to adjacent communities, but often threaten the usefulness of the harbor itself. In order to anticipate such impacts and to improve harbor design, it is desirable to be able to predict quantities of this sediment transport as a function of the wave and current conditions. The degree of success in improved predictions of sand movements along the coast are examined here."
