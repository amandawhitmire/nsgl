13,Abstract:,"Oregon Sea Grant operates the public education wing -- known as the Hatfield Visitor Center -- of the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, Oregon. As part of that, Oregon Sea Grant oversees the recruitment and training of volunteers who enrich visitors' experiences. In 2018, aquarium tank stands at the Visitor Center were renovated. Contractors replaced the 21-year-old metal supports then sculpted artificial rockwork around and under the tanks. This video takes the viewer on a tour of these upgrades."
