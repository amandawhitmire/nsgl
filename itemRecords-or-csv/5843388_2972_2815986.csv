9,Abstract:,"Achieving proper levels of salt and moisture in the production of smoked fish is a critical step in preservation. Salt analysis by official methods can be expensive and time consuming and requires skilled technicians. However, a good estimate of salt and moisture can be obtained quickly by using a much simpler test with a microwave oven that produces results accurate enough for quality control purposes, requires relatively inexpensive equipment and is easy to learn. This technical report explains the process in detail."
