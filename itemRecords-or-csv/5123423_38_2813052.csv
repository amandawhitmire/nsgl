10,Abstract:,"Michigan's first coho eggs came from Oregon. While charter boating there has had its ups and downs it has had nothing like the total collapse of the charter business in Michigan. Many services are offered the customer which are not available in the Great Lakes. Early in 1973, the idea came to an advisory service worker in the University of Michigan Sea Grant Program: with similar resources to be harvested in Oregon and Michigan, and with different traditions in the methods of harvesting, the time seemed ripe for an exchange of ideas between the two fishing communities. Counterparts of the Oregon State University Sea Grant Program agreed. Michigan and Oregon charter boat captains agreed. And two tackle manufacturers not only like the idea but generously supported financially an exchange of charter boat skippers between the Great Lakes (Michigan skippers) and the West Coast (Oregon skippers). Along with the differences in the fish, the Great Lakes skippers noted the apparently richer fish resources in the Pacific. The Oregon Fish Commission maintains a much larger stocking program for salmon than does Michigan. But, even without salmon, the ocean teems with catchable and edible fish. The Michigan skippers decided to put most emphasis on their return (from Oregon) to trying to establish some of the many support services for the business, such as the custom cannery, which had been established over many years on the coast. The Oregon skippers seemed most impressed with the effective combination of equipment and method which had been developed by the Michigan skippers and are testing it on the Oregon coast. The exchange was, of course, just the first step: the determination of which ideas were valuable to the other area. Sea Grant, with its charge of providing informal education to the water user, will continue to refine and disseminate this information for everyone's benefit."
