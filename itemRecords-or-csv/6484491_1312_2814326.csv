11,Abstract:,"West Coast fishermen, others in the seafood business, a scientist and a manager reflect on the potential ""big change"" that a changing climate may bring to fisheries. Whether it's the threat of ocean acidification or the uncertain effects that ocean conditions may have on a range of fish and shellfish, climate change is gaining the attention and concern of these representative participants in the large economic sector which is fisheries on the West Coast. The 13-minute documentary is produced by Oregon Sea Grant with partial funding from the NOAA Climate Program Office."
