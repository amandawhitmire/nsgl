18,Abstract:,"In spring 1978, when David L, Call, then Cornell's Extension director, was chairman of the Extension Committee on Organization and Policy (ECOP), he formed the ECOP Task Force on Sea Grant Relationships. The task force was to examine the outreach functions (called variously Extension, Advisory, public service, and other names) of Land Grant and Sea Grant institutions and the relationships between them. It was to identify problems existing and potential -and to note solutions to them, where possible. This is the report of that task force."
