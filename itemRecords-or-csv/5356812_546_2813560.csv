10,Notes:,Two newsletter issues in one entry for 1985.
11,Abstract:,"This newsletter started after a number of managers from Oregon's hatcheries retired, taking with them years of experience and experiments that were never published or, in many cases, even written down. Northwest Hatchery Newsletter now offers an outlet for this information. The information in this newsletter is often controversial and does not reflect the policies of any of the agencies involved. Some topics of interest in the 1985 issues include: Coho Presmolts: Good Idea or Bad Idea? by M. Solazzi and T. Nickelson; Waterless (almost) Egg Incubation, by M. Evenson and T. Rumreich; Improved Boot Dryer, by D. Whitlach. Number 2: USFWS Delphi Report on Spring Chinook Culture, M.Smith; Whirling Disease Reveals its Secrets, D. Ewing; Epsom Salts Separates Eggs but not Skin, D. Mills."
