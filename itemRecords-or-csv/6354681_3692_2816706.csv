15,Abstract:,"""Resilience holds the key to our future. It is a deceptively simple idea, but its application has proven elusive,"" wrote Jane Lubchenco, administrator of NOAA. Fishery management programs designed to control Pacific salmon for optimum production have failed to prevent widespread fish population decline and have caused greater uncertainty for salmon, their ecosystems, and the people who depend upon them. Strengthening salmon resilience will require expanding habitat opportunities for salmon populations to express their maximum life-history variation. Such actions also may benefit human communities by expanding the opportunities for people to express diverse social and economic values. The 11 essays in this book represent the most-forward thinking about resilience and Pacific salmon collected to date, and they point to new ways we may consider and interact with this iconic fish. It should be of interest not only to those active in fisheries but also to policymakers-​-​-​and, by extension, to those interested in the resilience of other ecological and social systems."
