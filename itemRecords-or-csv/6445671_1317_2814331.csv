9,Abstract:,"This report contains details from a survey conducted in May 2012 of Oregon coast elected officials, coastal professionals of the public sector, and other coastal professionals on the topic of climate change planning. The survey was based largely on a previous needs-​assessment conducted on the coast of California, and is part of a national study on coastal communities and climate change adaptation. Major findings feed into Oregon Sea Grant's objective of better understanding how to support coastal communities and their planning. We found that most coastal professionals believe and are mostly sure that their communities will experience the local effects of climate change, but that many (40 percent) coastal professionals were not currently involved in adaptation planning. We found that of the communities involved in planning, most were still in the first phase (""understanding​"") of climate change planning. Climate change planning ranks low on the list of priorities for coastal professionals, and most believe that while their professional efforts toward addressing climate change would benefit the community, a combination of governments and other organizations should initiate a local response to the likely effects of climate change. We surveyed coastal professionals on other topics important to our objective of better understanding how to support planning. Knowing that worldviews and values affect adaptation planning Executive Summary processes (Kahan et al., 2011; Ekstrom et al., 2010), we asked about worldviews and found there was little polarization in our test population. Barriers to climate change planning supported this finding opposition to climate change planning was not encountered by as many coastal professionals as expected; instead, lack of agreement over importance of climate change effects and lack of urgency regarding climate effects were rated highly as hurdles to planning. This finding is consistent with the finding that other potential stressors to the community, such as preparing for tsunami/earthqu​ake hazards and the economy, are taking priority. Finally, we asked about what specific information needs coastal professionals had. Most needed was information about diverse environmental and social considerations: the cost of climate adaptation, how to communicate climate risks, flooding or saltwater intrusion, species and habitat vulnerability, social and economic vulnerabilities​, and predictions of ecosystem impacts. Findings from this survey will be communicated to coastal professionals, including through the creation of both this report and expository videos. For the videos, experts on various main insights or themes of the survey will be interviewed to reflect on climate change adaptation planning on the Oregon coast. Data from the survey will also be used in a national report that will compare findings from other states and regions where a mostly identical survey was conducted with local coastal professionals."
