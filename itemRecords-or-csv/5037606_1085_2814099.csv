It is our hope that we can review the rules and regulations concerning inspection and certification of fish stocks in a meaningful, understandable manner to fish culturists. We also hope to explain, in detail, the procedures required to appropriately inspect fish or eggs destined for transport. The following topics are in this proceedings: Part I, Review of fish disease, Certification and inspection; Review of international regulations concerning fish health; Review of North American fish disease control regulations; Fish disease guidelines for the producers of cultivated fish in Oregon. Part II Inspection Techniques and Problems. Sampling and necropsy of fish for parasitic and bacterial diseases; The diagnosis and identification of bacterial fish pathogens; Diagnosis of parasitic diseases-​-​whirling disease and ceratomyxosis; Collection and preparation of samples for viral examination; Viral diagnosis: isolation and identification; Summary of panel discussion. Keyword: Marine Pathology."
