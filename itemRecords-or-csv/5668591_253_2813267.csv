13,Abstract:,"Natural forces, some cataclysmic and some gradual and relentless, have shaped the Oregon coast over millions of years. These dynamics are still at work, constantly reshaping the coast. What is different about the coast today, however, is our ubiquitous human presence, one consequence of which is that the same natural forces that shaped the coast so attractively in the past increasingly threaten human life and property. In response to these threats and to concerns that existing efforts to cope with them were inadequate, policy working group was convened to reconsider the entire issue. The resulting report addresses 23 issues, organized in four categories: hazard identification, beach and shore protection, land use, and disaster preparedness and response. The group makes 79 recommendations and suggests those actions and agencies, organizations, or institutions that could best implement each recommendation."
