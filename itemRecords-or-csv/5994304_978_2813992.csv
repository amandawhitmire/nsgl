12,Abstract:,"The gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) is the most common large whale seen from shore along the west coast of North America. Gray whales are found off the Oregon coast all year. They feed in shallow water near shore during the summer and fall, migrate south for breeding and calving during the winter, and migrate north in the spring. The gray whale gets its name from its blotchy color pattern. This brochure provides general information and facts on feeding, Southern migration, calving, breeding, Northern migration, Exploitation and conservation."
