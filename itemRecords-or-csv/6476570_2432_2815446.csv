10,Abstract:,"Technical report published in 2000. The opportunities for expanding water supplies in Oregon coastal municipalities are becoming increasingly limited. New water quantity and quality regulations, particularly those designed to protect and rebuild salmon runs, constrain water supply options. At the same time, however, demand for water is increasing. Coastal communities continue to grow in population and are targeted as tourist destinations."
