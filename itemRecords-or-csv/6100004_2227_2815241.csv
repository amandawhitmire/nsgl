9,Abstract:,"Environmental factors may affect the population ecology of potentially toxigenic Pseudo-​nitzschia spp. within the South Slough, Charleston, Oregon. Stationary and channel sites were sampled in 2005 and 2006 for: physical parameters including temperature, salinity, and nitrogen (as nitrate + nitrate) as well as biological variables chlorophyll a, Pseudo-​nitzschia cell concentrations, species identifications​, and domoic acid levels (particulate and dissolved DA). Linkages between physical and biological parameters were sought statistically. The results indicate temperature and salinity are important predictors of Pseudo-​nitzschia cell concentrations throughout the sampling periods. This indicates high abundances in autumn based on historical predictors. pDA levels, likely from P. australis and P. pungens, increased with temperature. dDA decreased with increasing pDA. This does not follow the historical trend of phytoplankton bloom abundance driven by nitrogen values within the South Slough. Further, these results document the presence of Pseudo-​nitzschia and DA within an estuary and may enhance management practices."
