11,Abstract:,"Macrophytic marine algae are a rich source of pharmacologicalâ€‹ly active compounds. Cell and tissue suspension cultures established from macrophytic marine algae have the potential to biosynthesize these compounds in a controlled environment within bioreactor systems at a scale required for further product development or commercial production. Toward this end, the authors recently developed a tubular recycle photobioreactor that integrates the best features of tubular, stirred-tank, and air-lift bioreactor configurations into one system. Under these conditions, gametophyte cell suspension cultures of the macrophytic brown alga ""Laminaria saccharina"" achieved a specific growth rate of 0.1/day and a maximum cell density exceeding 1000 mg DCW/L over a 30-day cultivation period. The efficient delivery of light to the suspension culture makes the system an attractive alternative to externally illuminated stirred- tank or air-lift bioreactors for the production of photosynthetic biomass."
