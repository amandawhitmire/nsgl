12,Abstract:,"The trawl fishermen operating off the coasts of Oregon and Washington often catch mixed species of groundfish. Although in the past these fishes have been managed on an individual species basis, managers have begun to set trip limits based on species complexes and mixed-species models have been developed to assess the effects of technological interactions. The specific objectives of this research were to (1) quantitatively define assemblages of fish caught in the commercial trawl fishery off the coasts of Oregon and Washington using data collected by observers on commercial vessels, (2) assess the accuracy/effect​iveness of the strategies described by Pikitch et al. (1988) by comparing tows designated by strategy with tows designated by the defined assemblages and, (3) develop a method of using consistencies in three data analysis techniques to select the assemblages."
