17,Abstract:,"The Pacific Ocean - once viewed vast, open -- is becoming valuable real estate. Fights over the space resemble frontier days. Decision makers require scientific and experiential data as they integrate new uses like marine renewable energy with existing commercial and recreational uses. No one argues that having the best available data and management practices about the ecological/phys​ical dimension is vital. Yet permitting processes rarely fail on technical or natural science grounds; rather because of a failure to attend to the human dimension. A comprehensive understanding of the role of socioeconomic and sociopolitical perceptions is useful for legislators and resource managers. Previous researchers noted that public knowledge is crucial for citizens to determine their real interests and make use of civic opportunities. Some go so far as to say that a public that is informed and engaged in coastal policy issues is vital if we are to make progress on environmental protection and sustainable development. We felt, therefore, that it was important to assess the scope and depth of policy-relevant knowledge among stakeholders and the public, to learn where they acquire their information about wave energy, and to flesh out the link between policy-relevant knowledge and understanding/a​cceptance of wave energy generation. By specifying the connection between knowledge holding and support for wave energy, purposeful public education and information dissemination efforts could be targeted effectively, and policy processes could be designed to meet citizen and community concerns and maximize policy input. The Human Dimension of Wave Energy Research Program involved social scientists studying wave energy in terms of the political/regul​atory processes and environmental, social and economic sustainability and acceptability through six research projects. Focusing on wave energy development, our research considered: How is wave energy off the Oregon coast perceived? Who are the stakeholders, are they engaged, and will their perceptions impact siting decisions? Does development impact coastal community well-being? How does wave energy compare to other renewables? Is it viewed differently among rural and urban populations? This presentation will highlight results from this 2-year program."
