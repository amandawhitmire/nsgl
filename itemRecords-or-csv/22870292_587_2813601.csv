11,Abstract:,"This publication describes an attempt to secure a reliable, efficient, and relatively inexpensive hydraulic power take-off to drive fishing machinery in out board motor-powered fishing dories. Five Pacific City-​type dories provided with outboard motors equipped with the hydraulic power take-off and gurdies were rigged and fished as trollers during the 1970 salmon trolling season. Five engines were employed in the project—40-​ and 60-hp Johnsons, a 50-hp Mercury, a 55-hp Fisher-Pierce Bearcat, and a 70-hp Chrysler. Each engine required the fabrication of a distinct hydraulic pump mount. All motors except the Chrysler 70 hp utilized a direct-drive in-line connection of the flywheel and pump shaft accomplished by a flex coupling. The Chrysler hydraulic power take-off consisted of a belt and pulley system. A concurrent effort was devoted to the design and testing of light-weight gurdies suitable for dories. The five dories logged a total of approximately 3,045 hours fishing time during the 1970season. Subsequent analysis of operational data, engines, and hydraulic components support the conclusion that a reliable, efficient, and relatively inexpensive hydraulic power take-off is attainable from outboard motors to power fishing machinery. Gurdies of light weight and durable construction suitable for dories were also designed and success fully tested and these gurdies will be offered to fishermen through a commercial source."
