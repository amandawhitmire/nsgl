10,Abstract:,"While some types of ocean use, such as recreational and commercial fishing, have received research attention, little research has been directed at Oregon's non-consumptive recreational ocean users. Surfers, kayakers, kiteboarders, boat-based nature viewers, divers, wind surfers, and boaters are among Oregon's non-consumptive recreational ocean users. They are neighbors and business owners, community leaders and family members, employees and friends. They are an important group of people making economic and cultural contributions to coastal communities, and one with a stake in the outstanding public ocean resources near and far from Oregon's shores. Non-consumptive recreational ocean users are often stewards of the beaches and sea, and they are coming to play on the ocean from all over Oregon and beyond. They are also currently underrepresente​d in the literature, and are poorly understood. This publication seeks to remedy that situation."
