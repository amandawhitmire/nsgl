9,Abstract:,"Wave energy is a new technology that is being tested on the Oregon Coast. These color sheets provide info to children on how an outreach specialist brings various ocean users like ecologists, technicians, scientists, and engineers to the table so they can plan where wave energy devices should go in the ocean to make sure wave energy is safe for humans, animals, and the environment."
