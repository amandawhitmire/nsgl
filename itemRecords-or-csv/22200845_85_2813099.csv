13,Abstract:,"Marine debris is a growing problem that harms the environment and the economy. Its impacts range from impeding navigation to entangling wildlife and fouling beaches. Research helps explore this issue, bridges knowledge gaps, and supports prevention and reduction efforts. In the recently-​released Oregon Marine Debris Action Plan (OR MDAP), local stakeholders identified future research actions to help combat marine debris. One such action was to, ""Develop research priorities for marine debris in Oregon with a focus on sources and reduction strategies. Encourage research to quantify and prevent the impacts of marine debris"". The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Debris Program and Oregon Sea Grant volunteered to co-lead this action, with Oregon State University (OSU) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as partners. Together this group engaged local stakeholders, generated ideas, and held a workshop discussing and prioritizing research to help address marine debris in Oregon. The OR MDAP contains a local stakeholder-​generated Marine Debris Priority List. It includes a research section that lists ideas relevant to Oregon, which the organizers sent to OR MDAP participants and other practitioners prior to the workshop. These parties reviewed, ranked, and added to the research topics, with a focus on addressing knowledge gaps. Based on their replies, the workshop organizers drafted a marine debris research priorities list. They invited participants to attend a one-day workshop at OSU Corvallis, Oregon for evaluating and prioritizing these research ideas. On May 30, 2017, twenty-four marine debris researchers and practitioners came together for the first Oregon Marine Debris Research Priorities Workshop. This document includes the proceedings for this first workshop. The workshop goal was to prioritize research topics from the Oregon Marine Debris Action Plan to help address local marine debris issues."
