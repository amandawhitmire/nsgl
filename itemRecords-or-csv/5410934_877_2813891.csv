12,Abstract:,"Clam digging is an exciting, inexpensive, and popular sport that combines fun and outdoor recreation for the entire family. It also provides a year-round source of excellent food. Living within Oregon's coastal bays are one or more of five major clam species--gaper, cockle, littleneck, butter, and softshell. This brochure tells you how, where and when to look for clams. It includes a poster that summarizes handy information about each type of clam: description, common and scientific names, regulations, habitat, location, relative abundance, mobility, size and cooking suggestions."
