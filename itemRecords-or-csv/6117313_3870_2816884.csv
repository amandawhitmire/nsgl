9,Abstract:,"Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas aquaculture is an important industry in the Pacific Northwest region and is worth over $110 million annually. Sporadic summer mortality outbreaks have caused severe financial hardship for oyster aquaculturists for several decades. These outbreaks appear to result from a complex interaction of deleterious environmental conditions with spawning-related energy metabolism and opportunistic infection. Selective breeding programs have been used successfully to produce oyster stocks that survive summer mortality syndrome. These programs are expensive to maintain and require substantial investments of time and effort. The efficiency of breeding programs can be increased by selecting broodstock based upon molecular markers associated with candidate genes for survival and also by using laboratory assays in the hatchery to identify and exclude poor-performing families prior to field evaluation. However, at this time candidate genes have not been identified for use in breeding programs and laboratory assays have not been fully developed. Therefore, the goal of this research was to identify potential candidate genes for improved survival by using cDNA microarrays to compare transcriptome-level responses between oyster families with low or high survival after heat shock, and to determine whether transcription of these candidate genes in juveniles was correlated with subsequent family-level field performance of adults. Overall, the observed patterns of gene transcription were consistent with current literature concerning summer mortality in oysters and marine mussels Mytilus edulis. In two different cohorts of oyster families, transcription levels of the adhesive protein galectin before or after heat shock were higher in families with low (<30%) survival of heat shock, whereas those of the protease inhibitor cystatin B before or after heat shock were greater in families with high (> 65%) survival of heat shock. We found that transcription levels of a number of genes including galectin, heat shock protein 27, and glutathione peroxidase in juveniles were significantly correlated with subsequent family-level survival or growth in the field. We conclude that galectin and cystatin B could be used for marker-aided broodstock selection and that the relationships between gene transcription in juveniles and subsequent family-level performance of adults could be exploited to identify and exclude potentially poor-performing families in the hatchery. These results should facilitate the improvement of selective breeding programs by providing a method of selecting broodstock for traits that are otherwise impractical to measure, and by reducing the costs associated with rearing and evaluating oyster families in the field."
