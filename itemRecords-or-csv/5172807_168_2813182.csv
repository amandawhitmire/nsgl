17,Abstract:,"Nationally and in our own state, maritime industries have experienced a gradual decline in tonnage and in economic position; the causes are multiple and complex. Oregon State University Extension Service's Marine Advisory Program sponsored this conference to evaluate the future of these key industries. The conference had four basic objectives: l. To bring into sharper focus the causes for the industry's decline. 2. To take a first step toward forming an alliance of the several components of the maritime industry. 3. To impress the Federal Government and elected representatives with the difficulties that handicap the industry. 4. To inform the public about the extent to which oceanborne commerce affects everyday living."
