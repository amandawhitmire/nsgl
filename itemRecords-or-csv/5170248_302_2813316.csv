10,Abstract:,"Fish fights have been a characteristic of Oregon's salmon fishing industry since the 1880's when rapid expansion in the kinds of gear used to harvest salmon on the Columbia River led to the first awareness of declining resource availability. One of the principle causes of fish fights was too many fishermen and too few fish. Initially, fish fights were acts of violence between groups of commercial fishermen. The legislature was also one of the battlegrounds. The overt issue sparking most fish fights has been the question of what were the best means for conservation of the fisheries resource? Beneath this facade of conservation were social and economic issues of resource use and allocation."
