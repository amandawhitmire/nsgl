12,Abstract:,"Oregon's Coastal Management Program, approved by the federal government in 1977, requires that local coastal governments and state regulatory programs address management issues such as geologic hazards. This calls for site inspections and reports from registered geologists when development is proposed in a hazardous zone. Between 1980 and 1982, four developments were constructed on active landslides in Newport, Oregon. Each site had been investigated by the same registered geologist, who recommended development even though his own hazards report, prepared in 1978 for the county, recognized three of these sites as significant geological hazards due to landslide activity. Soon after construction, each development was either partially or totally destroyed by continued landsliding. The Oregon Board of Geologist Examiners suspended his registration after a lengthy investigation. However, they left the door open to future reinstatement, in spite of their having declared him `incompetent' and `negligent.'"
