12,Abstract:,"Japan's Kobe Port was severely damaged during the Hyogoken Nanbu Earthquake of Janary 17, 1995, suffering a nearly total loss of operations and direct losses estimated to be about $5.5 billion. This paper summarizes the causes of this damage, and uses this experience as a case study to show that the economic benefits of including seismic risk reduction methods in the design and construction of ports in areas of moderate-​to-​high seismicity can far exceed the increases in initial construction costs. The paper also describes and illustrates an 'acceptable seismic risk' evaluation procedure for assessing the viability of alternative seismic risk reduction strategies for a given port."
