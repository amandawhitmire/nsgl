11,Abstract:,"Much of what is known about the bacteria that infect fish and the extent of the diseases they cause has resulted from human efforts to artificially propagate selected species. Almost without fail, the species selected for propagation are food fish. The bacteria that exist as pathogens among cultured fish were almost certainly derived from carriers used to initiate culture of the species. These bacteria did not evolve as pathogens among hatchery stocks but were transmitted from wild to hatchery fish. This report discusses the most important and best known bacteria recovered from and associated with diseased fish: ""Edwardsiella"", ""Yersinia"", ""Vibrio"", ""Aeromonas"", ""Pasteurella"", Rickettsiales, ""Clostridium"", the lactic acid bacteria, ""Renibacterium salmoninarum"", ""Mycobacterium"" spp., ""Nocardia"", ""Flexibacter"", ""Flavobacterium​"", ""Pseudomonas"", ""Staphylococcus​"", and ""Streptococcus""​."
