9,Abstract:,"If I have any bias that I can consciously recognize, it is in favor of ultimately international management of high seas fisheries and not the irrational patchwork management which threatens to materialize from the current trends of national practice and international negotiations Th​e question before this Committee today, though, is not directed at the ultimate nature of high seas fisheries management--the regime that will result from the Third Law of the Sea Conference, if it is successful in this respect--but instead asks what, if anything, the United States can and should do in the time span between now and that eventual international solution. Keywords: High seas fisheries management; international laws; Law; Fisheries; Management."
