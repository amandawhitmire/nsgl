13,Abstract:,"Quests are fun learning adventures that use clues and hints to encourage  participants to discover the natural, cultural and historical treasures  on the Oregon coast. Suitable for groups of all ages, self-guided Quests explore parks, trails and other outdoor spaces in new ways and at  users own pace. The clues are found in the award-winning Oregon Coast Quests guidebooks. At the end of each self-guided interpretive Quest, participants find a hidden Quest box containing a log-book to sign and a  hand-carved stamp to mark their accomplishment. The true ""treasure"" is the fun of the walk and learning about special places in the community. Quests are great fun for families and school groups - and once you've gone questing, your group may even want to help create a new Quest for the next edition of the guide book!"
