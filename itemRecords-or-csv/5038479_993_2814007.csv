11,Abstract:,"This bulletin emphasizes wood structures near and along the waterfront-that is, shops, homes, docks, piers, and bridges. Woods structures can be designed to last for decades, even for a century or two. All too often, however, they rot prematurely. Rot is the final stage of a decay process in which plants called fungi feed on wood."
