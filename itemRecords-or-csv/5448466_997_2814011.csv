10,Abstract:,"The wastewater treatment plant now under construction has been designed to provide service for a population approximately 60 percent larger than the present population of Corvallis. Capital and overhead costs of the new facility are therefore larger than they would have been for a smaller facility designed to serve only the present population. As a consequence, if the sewer system is financed solely by monthly rates, sewer charges must initially be higher than if a smaller giant had been constructed. Eventually the annual charges with the large plant will be less than with a small plant because total costs can be shared among the growing population that can be served by the large plant."
