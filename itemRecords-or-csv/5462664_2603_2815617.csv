12,Abstract:,"There is a growing interest in the use of population dynamics models in environmental risk assessment and the promulgation of environmental regulatory policies. Unfortunately, because of species and areal differences, such models must almost inevitably be both complex and species- or site-specific. Therefore, it is useful to discover what input parameters are of critical importance to the desired output; this information should enable the construction of simpler and more gereralizable models. Population madels can be considered as composed of two partly separable classes, one comprising the purely mechanical descriptors of dynamics from given demographic parameter values, and the other describing the modulation of the demographic parameters by environmental factors. A sensitivity analysis is applied here to the first of these classes on network models of mammalian and avian population dynamics."
