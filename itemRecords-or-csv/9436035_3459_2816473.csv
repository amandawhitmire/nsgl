11,Abstract:,"Low impact development practices must be implemented with care at each stage of the development. If a facility is properly designed but improperly constructed, the facility is unlikely to perform as intended and many benefits of low impact development will be lost. The facility may even pollute the stormwater further instead of protect it. This fact sheet is intended to provide an overview of general construction considerations for the project team."
