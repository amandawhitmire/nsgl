10,Abstract:,"Fishermen, marine researchers, educators, plastic manufacturers and government representatives met to address problems caused by fisheries-​generated plastic debris and derelict fishing gear. The workshop examined ways to reduce marine plastic debris and explained new laws intended to halt plastic pollution in the ocean. A primary objective was to explore incentive-type approaches to help attain this goal. Fishing industry representatives said the best incentive for fishermen to reduce their contribution to the plastic debris problem is education, coupled with assistance in shoreside solid waste disposal; most participants agreed that educational efforts would be effective. In an open session at the end of the conference, attendees formulated a statement of recommendations to be forwarded to appropriate law- and policy-makers in the federal government."
