15,Abstract:,"This is one of six videos about how aquarists with Oregon Sea Grant care for animals at the Hatfield Marine Science Center's Visitor Center in Newport, Oregon. This video explains how food is prepared and tailored to the needs of each species, including rockfish, pipefish, yellow tangs, skates, ratfish, sculpins and a moray eel. The use of feeding poles to make sure the food reaches specific animals is also discussed. Oregon Sea Grant operates the Visitor Center, which features interactive exhibits and attracts more than 150,000 visitors each year. It is home to Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program for K-12 students and teachers."
