10,Abstract:,"A lesson plan for middle-school life-science teachers. In this activity, students practice the technique of surveying seagrass beds in three localities along Oregon’s coast from provided photos, and use data to make inferences about what causes spatial variations. Students will learn about the importance of seagrass beds within Oregon’s coastal ecosystem and how seagrass beds vary along the coast, and they will practice using quadrats as a standard surveying technique to collect data and interpret variations in ecosystem health and biodiversity."
