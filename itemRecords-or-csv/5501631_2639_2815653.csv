11,Abstract:,Experiments were conducted to assess the immune system of juvenile coho salmon before and during smoltification to determine if there was a period of immunosuppressi​on accompanying other physiological changes during smoltification. The possible role of cortisol as an immunosuppresso​r was examined by evaluating the effects of treatment with cortisol.
