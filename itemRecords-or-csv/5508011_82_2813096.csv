11,Abstract:,"The 22 essays in this book examine how both our understanding of the ocean and its uses are changing, in many cases profoundly. The essays are written by experts who share their insights on such increasingly important topics as ocean mineral mining, overexploited fisheries, coastal development, the boom in trans-Pacific trade, and the complexities of ocean governance. The writers, who include academic, government, and business leaders from Oregon and elsewhere, identify trends in their fields of expertise and suggest `constructive passages to the Pacific Century.' A unifying theme of the essays is that the Pacific Ocean will be the arena of both great opportunities and significant challenges in the 1990s and the decades that follow. This book grew out of a conference held February 20, 1989, to celebrate the twenty-first anniversary of Oregon Sea Grant. In this volume we look ahead, However, our objective is not to say we know the future but rather to stimulate discussion about what the future can be. The oceans play a dominant role in all of life. By looking ahead and planning, we can encourage the pursuit of visions for a better future for the oceans and all of humanity. *** The following papers are included in this publication: 1) Ocean minerals: for profit or prophecy?
