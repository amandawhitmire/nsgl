13,Abstract:,"Interactions of two line solitons in the two-dimensional shallow-water field are studied based on the Kadomtsev-​Petviashvili (KP) theory. With the use of the normal form, the extended KP equation with higher-order correction is derived. This extended KP theory improves significantly the predictability of the original KP theory for soliton interactions with finite oblique angles. The previously existing discrepancy between the experiments and the theory in the Mach reflection problem is now resolved by the normal form theory."
