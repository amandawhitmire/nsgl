11,Abstract:,"In the U.S., a growing number of processors seek to develop value-added products from traditional species. Many of these new products are frozen. Processors and engineers need to know how a number of factors like product thickness, air velocity, or plate freezer suction pressures will influence freezing times. Analytical models can be very useful in predicting freezing times for food products, but usually only under ideal conditions. Researchers have been working on a project to place analytical freezing models in a framework that will be usable by industry. The article describes the current status of this project."
