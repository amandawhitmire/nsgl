16,Abstract:,"In this study, the authors investigated the effect of variations in sample composition on the penetration depth of light in the 700-1100 nm wavelength range. Previous studies conducted by these investigators involved the determination of lipid and salt content in live fish and seafood products by near-infrared spectroscopy. The need to determine the effect of sample composition on light penetration evolved from these studies. Cod tissue was selected because of its virtual fat-free nature. Initial results indicate that neither lipid content nor salt concentrations affect light penetration, which assures that comparable bulk portions of samples may be analyzed regardless of the composition."
