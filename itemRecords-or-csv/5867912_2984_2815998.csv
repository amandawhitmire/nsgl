11,Abstract:,The primary objective of this research was to examine the statistical properties associated with estimates of age composition for groundfish landings in Oregon from 1989 to 1994. The authors graphically present the distributions of estimated coefficients of variation associated with estimates of age composition for five species of groundfish to evaluate the appropriateness of the error structure assumed in fishery models to describe the uncertainty associated with the catch-at-age sample data. They also present a nonlinear regression technique and discuss other methods that can be used to determine a specific multinomial index to apply to particular age-composition data sets. A simple linear regression model is developed that describes the relationship between the multinomial indices and the number of boat trips sampled.
