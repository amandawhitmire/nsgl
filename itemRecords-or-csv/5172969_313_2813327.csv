13,Abstract:,"A major fraction of all overwater harbor facilities are constructed upon relatively open pile frameworks. The supporting pile structure provides vessel access to the facility for loading and mooring while allowing circulation in the underlying marine environment. The utility of the structure is enhanced measurably if locally occurring waves are attenuated rather than reflected, so that commercial and recreational vessel activities can proceed unimpeded. The design of a pile structure can include considerations for wave attenuation if a satisfactory predictive method is available to quantify the wave-pile interaction phenomena. A theory which accounts for directionally sensitive inertial and viscous damping has been develped for a two-dimensional structure interacting with monochromatic waves. An equivalent work linearizing procedure yields a potential flow problem satisfied by an eigen-series solution. Linear wave theory is applied outside the pile structure and a sea wall of arbitrary reflecting capacity may be specified at any distance from the leeward side of the structure. General solutions are matched at the sea-structure interface by requiring continuity of horizontal mass flux and pressure. The amplitude and phase of waves in the pile structure, the reflected wave and transmitted wave modes are solved from algebraic equations resulting from orthogonalizati​on of the interfacial boundary conditions. Comparison with experimental results are made. Optimization of design techniques with regard to wave-structure interaction with pile configurations are described. Enhancement of pile structure behavior with common surplus materials is discussed."
