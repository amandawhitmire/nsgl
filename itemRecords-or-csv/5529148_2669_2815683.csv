14,Abstract:,"Rickettsiales-​like and Chlamydiales-​like organisms have been reported to infect many species of aquatic animals. These reports have been largely descriptive; until now, attempts at in-vitro culture of these intracellular microorganisms have been unsuccessful. During 1989, coho salmon cultured in seawater net pens in Chile experienced an epizootic of unknown etiology. As part of an effort to determine the cause of this continuing epizootic, kidney tissue from diseased fish was inoculated onto an established chinook salmon cell line routinely used in the diagnosis of salmonid viral diseases. A Rickettsiales-​like agent was isolated in these cell cultures."
