14,Abstract:,"The authors previously reported the cloning of 3 trout Mx cDNA clones from rainbow trout cells and generated antisera to the trout Mx proteins. Here, they further characterize the induction of Mx protein by poly I:C ds RNA and IHNV in trout. Using the artificial IFN inducer, poly I:C dsRNA, and the rhabdovirus IHNV, they demonstrate that trout Mx proteins may be used as markers for the IFN response of trout ""in vitro"" and ""in vivo""."
