11,Abstract:,"A rain garden is a ""garden with a purpose""; it helps reduce the amount of excess water and associated pollutants entering local lakes, streams, and bays. The result is healthier waterways, fish, other wildlife, and people. This how-to guide provides information specific to Oregon's conditions, including the rainfall and appropriate plants for your site. It will help you design and build a rain garden to treat the stormwater runoff from your own home or business. You don't have to be a landscape professional to use this guide. It provides the necessary information to safely build and maintain a rain garden, along with references for more detailed guidance for special conditions."
