11,Abstract:,"In recent years the virtual collapse of the salmon fisheries, the shift in fishing pressure to groundfish species, relentless development pressures on land and water resources, and the rapid but spotty growth in tourism have been among the issues that have brought conflict and--in other ways-​-​opportunity to the Oregon coast. Oregon Sea Grant responds to the growing need for information and understanding on these and other issues by creating new knowledge through research and by disseminating knowledge through communications and both formal and informal education. This brochure highlights the Oregon Sea Grant Program and some of the ways it creates public benefits."
