11,Abstract:,"There is the widespread occurrence of a variety of pharmacological​ly active hydroxyicosanoi​ds in red algae. In mammals, icosanoids of this general type arise most commonly by metabolic action of 12-lipoxygenase on arachidonic acid or its congeners. Recent chemical work with a red alga from the Oregon coast, ""Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis,"" showed it to be a rich source of arachidonic and eicosapentaenoi​c acid derivatives oxidized at C-12. This study demonstrates the existence of a highly active lipoxygenase-​type activity in ""Gracilariopsis​."""
