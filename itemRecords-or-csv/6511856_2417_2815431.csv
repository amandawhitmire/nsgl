9,Abstract:,"The objective of this analysis was to assess the economic impact of shellfish aquaculture production in the states of Washington, Oregon and California. Our intent was to explicitly identify the production function of the industry through detailed interviews with key informants and a general survey of producers. The motivation for doing this research was to develop reliable economic information for policy makers managing local marine resources and global issues such as eutrophication of estuaries and effects of ocean acidification. The species covered include Pacific, Kumamoto, Eastern, European Flats, and Olympia Oysters, Manila, littleneck and geoduck clams, and Blue and Mediterranean mussels. These species are grown out on the ground, on the ground in bags or racked bags, and long line culture and are harvested using methods that include high pressure hoses, hand picking, and dredging."
