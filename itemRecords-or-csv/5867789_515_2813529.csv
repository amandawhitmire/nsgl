12,Abstract:,"The European green crab, ""Carcinus maenas,"" was first discovered on the Pacific coast of the United States in 1989, near San Francisco Bay. By 1998, it was clear that this invader had reached the Pacific Northwest. The green crab's reputation as a serious threat is well deserved. A voracious predator, able to tolerate air exposure, starvation, and wide ranges in temperature and salinity, the green crab was introduced from Europe to North America's Atlantic coast nearly 200 years ago. This book is intended to serve as a reference and a source of basic scientific information on green crabs. Additionally, its list of hundreds of citations will direct readers to further information on the green crab's biology, ecology, past invasions and economic impacts. By design the book has a decidedly Pacific Northwest orientation. Intended audiences include researchers who are unfamiliar with ""Carcinus,"" resource managers, shellfish growers, extension agents, and educators."
