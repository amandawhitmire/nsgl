10,Abstract:,"Manayunkia speciosa, a fresh water polychaete, is the definitive host of Ceratomyxa shasta, a salmonid parasite endemic to the Klamath River. Little is known about the survival of this host under various environmental conditions. This study investigated the survival of M. speciosa under varying water temperature regimes and following drying in two of the primary substrates for this host, cladophora and a mixture of sand and silt. The polychaete was able to survive 24 h when water was removed, and survival was higher at lower temperatures. These effects were seen in both substrate types. Water temperature also had an effect on C. shasta actinospores, with actinospore morphology maintained longer at cooler temperatures. In challenge trials as few as 5 actinospores were capable of causing lethal infections in susceptible fish."
