9,Abstract:,"The Model VR-1B fog detection system was developed by Oregon State University for the U. S. Coast Guard so that, several 13th Coast Guard District stations can detect fog at their harbor entrance at night or when observation tower is unmanned. An infrared thermometer remotely senses water temperature at the harbor entrance. This temperature is displayed on a meter at the station communications panel. KW: WEATHER; FOG; DETECTION."
