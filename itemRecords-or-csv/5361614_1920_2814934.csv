10,,Legal indicia (primarily court opinions) of federal-state conflict over outer continental shelf oil and gas development in the 1980's are cited to support more general observations about intergovernment​al relations offshore. The patterns derived from the offshore oil and gas experience are used to predict the probable course of intergovernment​al relations in projected offshore hard minerals development and to evaluate proposed improvements in the current scheme.
