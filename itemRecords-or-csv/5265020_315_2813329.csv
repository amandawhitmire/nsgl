12,Abstract:,The Model SL-1A tide gauge system was developed by Oregon State University for the U.S. Coast Guard so that several 13th Coast Guard District stations can have direct readout of tide level on the communicator's panel for their own operational use and for reporting to National Weather Service storm-surge forecasters in scheduled weather reports.
