10,Abstract:,"The field of resource management is currently undergoing a difficult transition as it broadens to accommodate new values and interests. Using marine fisheries as examples, this paper describes the proximate and underlying causes of the human-​ecological problem. It identifies areas in which basic research is needed on the behavioral dynamics of marine resource use, including incentives, feedbacks, management scale, monitoring and evaluation, alternative management approaches, the role of history, and human capital. It also discusses the cost of failing to invest in social science research and identifies barriers to interdisciplina​ry research."
