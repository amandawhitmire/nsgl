11,Abstract:,"The alternation of coastal uplift and abrupt coastal subsidence together with tsunami deposition provide a potentially unique record of interplate paleoseismicity in strongly coupled subduction zones. One test of active subduction tectonics in the Cascadia margin would be the evidence of cyclic uplift and abrupt subsidence of coastal areas. This paper describes in detail the stratigraphy and tectonic implications of buried marsh deposits from Netarts Bay, a coastal lagoon in northern Oregon. Six subsidence events that occurred during the last several thousand years are examined. Results argue for abrupt tectonic subsidence associated with coseismic strain release events in this historically aseismic subduction zone."
