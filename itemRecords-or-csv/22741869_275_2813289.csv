10,Abstract:,"Retention of existing businesses and community encouragement of local firms’ continued growth has become an essential aspect of many local and regional economic development programs. While attraction of new businesses is a highly visible aspect of most economic development programs, studies have shown that businesses that already exist in a community account for up to 70% of all net change in local employment, and up to 86% in rural areas.1Recogniz​ing the importance of local firms, the Oregon Economic Development Foundation and Eastern Maumee Bay Chamber of Commerce, in conjunction with Ohio State University Extension and the Ohio Sea Grant College Program established a Business Retention and Expansion (BRE) Program to assist these firms in achieving their growth objectives and to improve the overall business environment in Oregon, Ohio. In 2019, the Oregon Economic Development Foundation and Eastern Maumee Bay Chamber of Commerce surveyed existing businesses about their perceptions, plans, and concerns. A partnership was established with the Ohio State University Extension BRE Program utilizing Survey Gold software for survey analysis and other BRE tools to assist in accomplishing an effective local program. The objectives of the City of Oregon’s BRE Program are to: o Identify and address concerns and issues of existing businesses by creating a value-chain of partners, including local and state government as well as private organizations and enterprises. o Identify opportunities to stimulate local job growth. o Establish and maintain an ongoing program that develops and fosters long-​term positive/produc​tive relationships among public and private entities in Oregon, Ohio."
