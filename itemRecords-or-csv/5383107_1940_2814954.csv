14,Notes:,Alternate title: Using the Rolling-Period Test To Estimate Fishing Vessel Stability.
15,Abstract:,"The rolling period test is intended to provide a reasonable estimate of the stability of fishing vessels up to 80 feet in length when boat owners can't easily carry out inclining tests. It provides information to calculate the metacentric height of a vessel, a measure of its stability. Generally speaking, a fishing vessel is designed so that it has a safe level of stability. However, the stability may change because of modifications made or equipment installations; any changes in a boat's structure or weight may affect its stability. The test described here will give you a quick and reasonably accurate estimate of your fishing vessel's stability."
