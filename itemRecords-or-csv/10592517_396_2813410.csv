9,Abstract:,"The blogsite of the Oregon Coast STEM Hub program. The Oregon Coast STEM Hub promotes integrated science, technology, engineering and math education and serves coastal teachers, students and communities. It is one of six Regional STEM Hubs funded in 2014-2015 by the Oregon Department of Education. The Oregon Coast STEM Hub is centered at OSU's Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport and serves the entire Oregon coast region. Employment opportunities along the Oregon Coast have been growing in fields such as scientific research, marine technology, natural resource management, and eco-tourism. To prepare our local students for jobs in these and other STEM fields, and to help improve STEM literacy among all citizens, the Hub seeks to expand and improve the opportunities for students and teachers to engage in STEM learning."
