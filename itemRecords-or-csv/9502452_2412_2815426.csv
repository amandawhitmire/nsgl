9,Abstract:,"Influences of tidal and slower (subtidal) oceanic flows over the continental shelf and slope off Oregon are studied using a high-resolution ocean circulation model and comparative model-data analyses. The model is based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System, a fully nonlinear, three-​dimensional model using hydrostatic and Boussinesq approximations. The model horizontal resolution is 1 km, and the study period is summer 2002."
