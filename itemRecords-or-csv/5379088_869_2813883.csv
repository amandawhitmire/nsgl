10,Abstract:,"Erosion along the west coast of the United States was unusually severe during the winter of 1982-83. Although not as major as the erosion experienced in California, beach erosion and property losses were also widespread on the coast of Oregon. The purpose of this paper is to report on the unusual processes and patterns of Oregon coastal erosion which resulted from the 1982-83 El Nino-related rise in sea level."
