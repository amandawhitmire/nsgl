13,Abstract:,"The ribonucleoprote​in gene of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) has been expressed in ""Escherichia coli"" as a ""trpE"" fusion protein. This viral protein does not induce protective immunity to lethal IHNV infection in fish, and virus-​neutralizing antibodies do not react with this viral protein. However, when it was administered with a bacterial lysate containing a region of the IHNV glycoprotein, there was enhanced resistance in immunized fish to lethal virus infection."
