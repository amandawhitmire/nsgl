10,Abstract:,"Are cabezon a single, genetically homogenous population or are they composed of multiple, genetically distinct populations? New results of a California Sea Grant and California Department of Fish & Game study strongly suggest that West Coast cabezon are composed of at least eight genetically distinct populations. Six of these are in California in the areas around Fort Bragg, Half Moon Bay, Morro Bay, Santa Barbara/Ventura​, the Channel Islands and San Diego. One population was identified in southern Oregon near Coos Bay and one in Puget Sound in Washington. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo biology professor Francis Villablanca, who led the genetic analysis, bases this conclusion on the frequency distribution of different genotypes along the West Coast. This clearly showed a characteristic clustering of certain genotypes in eight geographic provinces. (See map.) ""What we don't know is why we see this pattern,"" Villablanca said. ""We don't know if certain genotypes have been maintained because they confer some adaptive advantage or whether it is just genetic drift, in which genotypes are lost due to the size of the local breeding population."""
