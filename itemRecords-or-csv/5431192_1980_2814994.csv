11,Abstract:,"The most commonly encountered marine fish parasites with human infection potential are larval anisakid nematodes that normally parasitize adult marine mammals. Cestodes in the genus ""Diphyllobothriâ€‹um"" also infect humans, who may acquire the worms from ocean-caught salmon. Normal cooking procedures render fish preparations safe because parasites are killed after 1 minute at 60 deg C; freezing to -20 deg C for 24 hours also kills the parasites. Although the recent popularity of raw fish preparations has resulted in an increased occurrence of human infections from this source, the total number of cases reported in North America and Europe is very low. This contrasts with Asia where cultural factors lead to a greater risk of infection."
