13,Abstract:,"The high pressure processing (HPP) of foods can achieve the inactivation of microbial pathogens with minimal losses in food quality. The scale-up of food preservation processes based on the application of HPP is relatively simple; this is a factor that explains best shy HPP is the only new alternative technology for food preservation that has reached consumers with a variety of new products. In this article, the essential components of the HPP units are described and key differences between high and low commercial-cost applications are also outlines. Examples of numerous specific competitive commercial opportunities to implement this novel technology are then presented."
