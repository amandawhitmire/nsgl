12,Abstract:,"Culture of bivalve larvae is characterized by high variability in larval survival and growth, and by considerable variation in the proportion of larvae which successfully metamorphose. Bacteria have been suggested to play an important part in influencing larval culture success. Research reported here demonstrated that additions of bacteria (strain CA2) as a food supplement to xenic larval cultures of the oyster ""Crassostrea gigas"" consistently enhanced growth of larvae during different seasons of the year."
