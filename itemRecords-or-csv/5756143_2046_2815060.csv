14,Abstract:,"Concern about declining Oregon coastal salmon runs led to petitions to list them under the Endangered Species Act. In response, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber advanced a voluntary restoration plan rather than a regulatory approach with federal requirements. The National Marine Fisheries Service accepted the governor's approach. This survey of 505 Oregon coastal residents found solid support for a voluntary, nonfederal approach. Residents showed a willingness to pay and volunteer for salmon restoration that is comparable to responses to other surveys done in the region during the 1990s. The survey also found coastal residents were very skeptical of government and scientists; instead, they relied on word of mouth, TV, and radio for most of their information. Values regarding environmental and economic priorities better explain differences among respondents than demographic variables such as age, gender, residence, education, and income."
