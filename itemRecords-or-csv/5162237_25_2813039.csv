13,Abstract:,"Sea Grant has a mandate, within enacting federal legislation and by intent through state, local and industry support, to generate new knowledge through research, to train students through education and to put new knowledge to work for the benefit of all Oregonians who look to the sea for answers. This annual report for 1975-1976 emphasizes the thoughts and perceptions about the Oregon ocean as stated by a number of citizens. Ranging in age from an elementary school student to a distinguished senior citizen and in interest from a metropolitan consumer of ocean resources to a successful ocean rancher, these are real people speaking about the ocean in their own words. To be useful to the people of Oregon, the Sea Grant College Program must address the marine resource problems and opportunities of the northeastern Pacific Ocean and associated coastal zones. We plan with the people. This, then, is their story."
