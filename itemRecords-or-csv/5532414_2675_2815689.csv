11,Abstract:,"The safety of live attenuated vaccines has been questioned in the case of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) because virus transmission occurs via the water. Since the virion surface glycoprotein of IHNV is immuno-â€‹protective, a subunit vaccine consisting of the glycoprotein was considered as an alternative. To determine if the baculovirus system is capable of expressing the IHNV glycoprotein, recombinant baculoviruses carrying the IHNV glycoprotein gene were constructed. A protein identical in size to the glycosylated glycoprotein of IHNV was expressed at high levels in cells infected with the recombinant viruses. The expressed protein reacted with antiserum to the glycoprotein on Western blots (immunoblots)."
