12,Abstract:,"Tourism is considered to be one of the world's largest and most influential economic sectors. This expansive industry plays a dominant role in the economy of coastal regions in particular (Foundation for Environmental Education 2006). When not properly managed, tourism activities can lead to negative impacts on the environment. This led to the creation of ecotourism, as well as the promotion of education to be used as management strategies to minimize these adverse effects while enhancing visitor conservation knowledge, views, & behaviors. Success of the overall educational experience, however, depends on a number of factors including the program design and training for educators (Beaumont 2001). The conservation and education expertise of accredited aquariums under the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) may provide such interpretive tools often not effectively met by ecotourism operations. The present research focuses on developing a strategic conservation plan for the Oregon Coast Aquarium (OCA) in Newport, OR that assesses the potential for environmental education standards of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) to be utilized by and benefit the ecotourism industry. Qualitative interviews with AZA staff, local ecotourism companies, government officials, and accreditation organizations will be conducted. The overarching objective of this study is to produce a marine conservation model, incorporating an ecotourism component, to be used by AZA institutions. This flagship management strategy has the potential to reinforce aquarium conservation messaging, while decrease the negative impacts caused by coastal recreation & tourism. Success of such institutional partnerships may further lead to the future development of an effective ecotourism certification program under the Association of Zoos and Aquariums."
