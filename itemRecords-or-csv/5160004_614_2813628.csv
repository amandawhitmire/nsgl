11,Abstract:,"This bulletin was prepared to assist you in understanding some of the terms and concepts of business management as they apply to fishing. There are no ""short cuts"" to better management, and this bulletin does not pretend to provide ready solutions to your management problems. Unfortunately, the terminology of business management is frequently confusing to the uninitiated, Businessmen, as well as fishermen, have their own ""language."" Although new and sometimes confusing! terminology is minimized here, you should be prepared to learn some unfamiliar business management concepts. This requires study, as well as reading, of this bulletin - and sufficient motivation to take advantage of other publications and programs leading towards better business management."
