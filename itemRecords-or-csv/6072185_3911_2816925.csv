13,Abstract:,"The isolation and characterizatio​n of nine polymorphic microsatellite loci (eight tetranucleotide and one dinucleotide) from the canary rockfish ""Sebastes pinniger"" are described. Polymorphism at these loci revealed from six to 28 alleles, with expected heterozygositie​s ranging between 0.42 and 0.88, enabling high-resolution genetic population structure investigation for this overfished species in the northeastern Pacific. They also amplify in 13 other congeneric species, providing highly variable loci for research on other rockfishes."
