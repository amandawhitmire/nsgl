12,Abstract:,"Surimi, a washed and refined form of minced fish meat, is widely used for fabricating new textured food items because of its gel-forming capacity. An accurate prediction of cooking time for surimi products necessitates a study of the variable heat transfer coefficient. Comparisons between simulated and measured temperature distribution histories indicated that the inverse method, a nonlinear regression procedure, gave a relatively accurate estimation of the heat transfer coefficients, while the lumped mass method and the heat flux method overestimated the coefficients."
