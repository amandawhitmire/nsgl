14,Abstract:,"Although the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid-​mediated immunosuppressi​on have received only limted attention in the field of fish immunology, reduction in the resistance of fish to pathogenic challenge in the presence of elevated cortisol levels has been demonstrated. The authors present the first demonstration of the in-vitro sensitivity of salmonid lymphocytes to physiological concentrations of cortisol that are associated with stress in-vivo. The mechanisms of this suppression are examined; results suggest that cortisol may exert its immosuppressive effects by influencing the production of required growth or differentiation factors."
