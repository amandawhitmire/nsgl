13,Abstract:,"While walking down a Pacific Northwest beach after a strong winter storm, you might find a gray, rounded rock riddled with hundreds of tiny oval holes and a few larger round holes. This fact sheet tells how a rock becomes the home of a colony of worms, ""Dodecaceria fewkesi,"" related to the tube-building worms such as feather duster worms and calcareous tube worms."
