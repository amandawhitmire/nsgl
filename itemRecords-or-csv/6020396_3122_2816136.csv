14,Abstract:,"Chitosan used for protein recovery from surimi wash water (SWW) appears to work by mechanical entrapment and electrostatic interaction of chitosan amino groups with anionic groups on proteins. Effectiveness is increased by chitosan (Chi) complexation with alginate (Alg). Insoluble solids from SWW (P1) and soluble solids coagulated by Chi- Alg (P2) were recovered by centrifugation and freeze-dried. Protein content of P1 and P2 was 61.4 and 73.1%, respectively. Histidine, lysine, methionine and phenylalanine in the recovered proteins were higher than in commercial feed ingredients. In a rat feeding trial, a casein control and diets formulated with SWW protein at 10% and 15% substitution showed no significant difference (p<0.05) in protein efficiency ratio. Blood chemistries revealed no deleterious effect of protein substitution or chitosan."
