10,Abstract:,"This report contains observations made aboard a foreign vessel by an official fisheries observer for the National Marine Fisheries Service. In five weeks the crew processed more than 5,600 metric tons of pollock, producing about 1,200 t of surimi. At-sea process operations for surimi production are described. Separate sections deal with various harvest and production steps. Comments are included to clarify the operations as observed. A final comment section points out details that might be of particular interest to a shore facility."
