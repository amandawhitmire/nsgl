9,Abstract:,"This project developed a series of ""alternative futures"" for coastal communities. This one focuses on Gray's Harbor and combines current state-​of-​the-​art predictions of possible climate change impacts on this coastal community, biophysically-​based models of flooding, erosion, and similar coastal processes. It includes projections of human population growth and development associated with future growth, stakeholder-​developed management policies guiding development pattern, zoning and response to natural hazards to better understand the possibilities and consequenses of alternative management strategies on a variety of community impacts, now and into the future."
