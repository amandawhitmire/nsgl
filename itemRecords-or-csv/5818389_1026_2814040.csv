12,Abstract:,"This resource book will help middle-school teachers plan field trips to the seashore and conduct students' investigations into living organisms and coastal ecosystems. The curriculum covers basic marine ecology concepts: habitat, tidal cycle, predator and prey, microscopic plankton, life cycles, food relationships, adaptation, and above all, conservation. The author uses Pacific Coast organisms as examples, but the concepts and methods can be applied to all coastal areas. Besides a glossary of illustrated terms, the book contains 39 overhead transparencies and 15 student worksheets. A set of 86 beautifully illustrated Pacific Coast Information Cards can be ordered to use with the resource guide."
