10,Abstract:,"Fish suffer from the same kinds of diseases that occur in other types of animals, and many of the methods of control are also similar. Health management in aquaculture depends on an integration of maintaining optimal environmental conditions, enhancement of the animal's resistance, and control of pathogenic organisms. These aspects are discussed here as they relate to salmonid culture, but most of the principles are germane to other types of aquaculture."
