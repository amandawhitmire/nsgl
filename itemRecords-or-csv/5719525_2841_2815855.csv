10,Abstract:,"In June 1990, President George Bush placed a ten-year moratorium on the leasing of 84 million acres of the U.S. outer continental shelf (OCS) for oil and gas development. Some areas were 'frontier areas,' without previous offshore oil and gas development; others had offshore development already in place. Culminating a period of intense political activity, the moratorium was to stay in effect until adequate environmental assessment had been done. Some view the moratorium as a frustrating setback to fully developing needed energy resources; others view it as a reprieve and an opportunity for strategic planning. Now, midway through the moratorium, this study takes stock of OCS oil and gas activity nationwide, of environmental research on the OCS, and of the Pacific Northwest's status as an oil and gas frontier."
