8,Abstract:,"Designed for sportfishers, ""Marine Recreational Fishing in Oregon"" is a series of three 16x21-inch flyers for the north, central, and south coasts of the state. Each flyer describes the kinds of fish caught off that portion of the coast and lists the fishing access areas there. The flyers also explain which fish live where and suggest the best kinds of rigs and bait to use. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife produced the publications. Each guide includes a full area map."
