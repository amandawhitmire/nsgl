10,Abstract:,"The United States and Japanese counterpart panels on aquaculture were formed in 1969 under the United States-Japan Cooperative Program in Natural Resources (UJNR). The panels currently include specialists drawn from the federal departments most concerned with aquaculture. Charged with exploring and developing bilateral cooperation, the panels have focused their efforts on exchanging information related to aquaculture that could be of benefit to both countries. The UJNR was begun during the Third Cabinet-Level Meeting of the Joint United States-Japan Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs in January 1964. In addition to aquaculture, current subjects in theprogram include desalination of seawater, toxic micro-​organisms, air pollution, energy, forage crops, national park management, mycoplasmosis, wind and seismic effects, protein resources, forestry, and several joint panels and committees in marine resources research, development, and utilizations. Accomplishments include increased communication and cooperation among technical specialists; exchanges of information, data, and research findings; annual meetings of the panels, a policy-​coordinative body; administrative staff meetings; exchanges of equipment, materials, and samples; several major technical conferences; and beneficial effects on international relations. The following papers are in this proceedings: 1) A review of some studies of food requirement and food webs in the fish stock assessment, by Takashi Nakanishi, pp. 1-2. 2) Interactions of dietary energy and protein in diets for striped bass and its hybrids (Morone Sp.), by Margie Lee Gallagher, pp. 3-17. 3) Quantitative amino acid requirements of fingerling coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), by Shigeru Arai and Hiroshi Ogata, pp. 19-28. 4) The nutritive value of alternative protein sources in the diets of cultured salmonids, by F.M.
