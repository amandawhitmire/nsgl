12,Abstract:,"The myxozoan parasite, Ceratomyxa shasta, has been recognized as a serious impediment to salmonid aquaculture in the Pacific Northwest of North America since it was first observed in 1948 (Wales and Wolf, 1955). Natural infections by C. shasta are known to occur in several species of Salmonidae (Table 1) in the Pacific Northwest of North America and Canada. However, within a species, strains of salmonids originating from enzootic waters are often more resistant compared with strains from non-enzootic locations. This virulent parasite primarily invades the posterior intestinal tract of susceptible salmon and trout, triggering an acute inflammatory reaction involving polymorphonucleâ€‹ar leukocytes (PMN's), fibroblasts, and macrophages. The epithelial lining necrotizes, fragments, and ultimately sloughs, and is replaced by fibrous connective tissue containing host cells and parasite trophozoites. The lumen may contain epithelial cells, epithelial cell fragments, PMN's, fibroblasts and different parasite stages (Bartholomew et al. 1989b). Although infection is commonly detected first in the posterior intestine, as the trophozoite stages of C. shasta proliferate the infection spreads to other organs and eventually becomes systemic. Death of the host may be a direct result of damage by the parasite or may result from secondary invasion in the damaged tissue."
