12,Abstract:,"In Dover sole (""Microstomus pacificus""), a commercially important northeast Pacific Ocean flatfish, metamorphosis differs from the rapid process described for most flatfish species. Its protracted metamorphic period provides an opportunity to examine changes in otolith structure and chemistry associated with each stage of metamorphosis. In this study, patterns of otolith microstructure and microchemistry (Sr/Ca ratios) are described in larval and juvenile Dover sole and related to developmental events and habitat."
