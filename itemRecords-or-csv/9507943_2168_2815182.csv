14,Abstract:,"The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) is a major source for near-field tsunami through mega-thrust earthquake raptures threatening the coastal community life safety in the Pacific Northwest region (Goldfinger et al, 2012). A near-field tsunami is likely to come onshore within 20 to 40 minutes after the initial earthquake. This research presents a multimodal evacuation simulation for a near-field tsunami through an agent-based modeling framework. The goals of this research are to investigate how the choice of different modes of transportation (i.e., walking, automobile, and public transit) impacts the estimation of casualties.The city of Seaside, Oregon, was selected as a case study site for this research because it has been identified as having a high risk to the Cascadia subduction zone tsunami (Wood, 2007). The current tsunami evacuation plan for the area calls for horizontal evacuation on foot. Other modes of transportation (i.e., automobile uses, public transit) need to be considered as well to ensure an efficient evacuation. This is an ongoing study to understand the how different modes of transportation impact life safety in the context of the near-field tsunami hazard. For this project, we use an agent-based evacuation model, which considers the milling time, and variation in travels speeds to estimate the loss of life due to the tsunami hazard. We compare the general case of tsunami evacuation with the varying adoption rate of different modes of transportation. As a result, a comprehensive multimodal tsunami evacuation plan is evaluated through this model."
