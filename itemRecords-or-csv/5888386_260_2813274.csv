12,Abstract:,"This CD-ROM video shows how organizations around the United States are already successfully using the affordable technology of low power radio, even without previous broadcast experience. Low power radio automatically broadcasts prerecorded messages on select AM frequencies. The message can be changed frequently and easily, and the station can operate unattended. In this educational CD-ROM video, hear and see how a range of users, including chambers of commerce, businesses, museums, parks, ports, and highway authorities are using this communication technology. The original video has been compressed to QuickTime and Windows Media formats and will play on virtually any recent Mac or PC computer."
