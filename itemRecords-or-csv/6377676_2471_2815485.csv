15,Abstract:,"We are developing an inquiry based exhibit to educate the public about the variability of currents in an estuary and how scientific models can be used to study estuary dynamics. Physical oceanography and modeling have recently become priorities in national and statelevel goals for science and math curriculum as well as ocean literacy, but neither goal for specific content or educational materials has been reached. The exhibit theme used to introduce these topics is Olympia Oyster restoration in the local Yaquina Bay Estuary. The interactive game component mimics a method for native oyster restoration efforts, depositing oyster shells, removed during harvesting, back into the estuary to create habitat for oyster larvae to settle onto. The user is tasked with helping these efforts by finding a location in the estuary where a) the currents are not too strong that oyster larvae get washed into the ocean, and b) there is enough circulation to deliver food and supprt oyster growth. The site for prototyping and evaluation of the exhibit is the Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) in Newport, Oregon. Research on the effectiveness of the exhibit will inform future strategies for communicating physical oceanography research topics and scientific modeling methods to general audiences."
