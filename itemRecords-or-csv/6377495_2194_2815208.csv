11,Abstract:,"My research interests lie in the evaluation and assessment of collaborative, community based organizations that work to incorporate the wants and needs of local stakeholders into management decisions. I am focusing on this within the context of salmon recovery efforts in the Pacific Northwest and more specifically Oregon by examining the activities of watershed councils under the Oregon Plan for Salmon and Watersheds. I see the human dimension as the least understood and arguably one of the most important elements of ecological restoration and the conservation of marine and coastal resources. Watershed councils are tasked with, among other things, disseminating information in an effort to improve habitat for fish and wildlife populations. Measuring the ecological outcomes associated with these efforts is relatively well understood, but attempting to measure social and cultural outcomes becomes much more ambiguous and challenging. This represents the crux of my research interests; I'm working with watershed councils, OWEB, Meyer Memorial Trust and Bonneville Environmental Foundation in an effort to add more depth and breadth to current stakeholder engagement, outreach and education evaluative metrics. My research will be both quantitative and qualitative employing interviews, focus groups, surveys, participatory observation and archival record analysis."
