It provides a series of reports on the laws and institutions affecting the Columbia River's anadromous fishery and are designed to serve two purposes. First, as a mechanism to report to the public the results of NRLI's more detailed legal analyses. Second, through the inclusion in each issue of ""Fish Law Briefs"" providing a format in which the pubic may be apprised of the numerous on-going developments impacting upon the Columbia's salmon and steelhead. Cover articles in these issues include: Small scale hydropower and anadromous fish: Lessons and questions from the Winchester Dam Controversy; Ninth Circuit upholds constitutionaliâ€‹ty of the Northwest Power Planning Council; Livestock grazing in riparian zones: Ensuring fishery protection in federal rangeland management; The failed promise of the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Program and what to do about it."
