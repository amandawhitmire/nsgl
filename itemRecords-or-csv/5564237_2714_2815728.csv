11,Abstract:,"Traditionally, the sera and media used in fish cell culture have been adapted from mammalian cell culture procedures with little or no modification. Thus, fetal bovine serum (FBS) has been used routinely in fish culture as the preferred serum supplement. Utilization of FBS in lymphocyte culture has yielded varying results for both mammals and fish. Our studies reveal that FBS does not allow for maximal proliferation of lymphocytes in response to mitogens. Trout plasma supplementation on the other hand yielded consistently higher mitogenic responses."
