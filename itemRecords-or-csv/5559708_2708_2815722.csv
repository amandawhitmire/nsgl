10,Abstract:,"Groundfish comprise the most valuable single fishery on the U.S. west coast, contributing 23.2% of total fishery exvessel value in 1988. The supply of groundfish is determined by the interaction of events in the harvesting, processing, marketing and regulatory sectors. The groundfishery targets on a large number of species which vary widely in type, size, location, and market value; fleets are diverse in size and gear type. The harvest sector is comprised of three types of fisheries: shore based, joint ventures, and foreign. Processing firms range widely in size and extent of horizontal integration. Most major groundfish stocks are at or near maximum sustainable levels of exploitation. The fishery remains open access but stringent effort controls apply."
