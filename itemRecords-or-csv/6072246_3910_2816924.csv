16,Abstract:,"An optical system was developed using commercial low-cost optical components to monitor food processes by measuring changes in optical rotation (OR) of chiral compounds. The OR signal as a function of processing time and the sample temperature were collected and recorded using a computer data acquisition system. Sucrose (1 g/100 ml solution) and distilled water were used to calibrate the instrument. Sucrose solutions (0.01 to 30 g/100 ml solution) were used to determine its sensitivity, linearity and stability. The instrument was validated by monitoring the hydrolysis of sucrose. System has been tested during a fermentation and sugar-protein interaction as a function of temperature."
