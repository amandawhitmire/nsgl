11,Abstract:,"Fishery management is a dual process of conservation and allocation. Conservation involves determining the amount of fish stock that can be made available for use and still keep the population healthy and viable. Allocation concerns who gets the opportunity to participate in the fishery. Conservation objectives are widely accepted, whereas allocation requires making judgments among many objectives. The purpose of separating conservation and allocation is to give priority to the maintenance of a healthy resource. A number of organizational arrangements can accomplish this separation, including relatively minor modifications to the FCMA and use of the existing council structure in new ways."
