14,Abstract:,"Water, sediment, and shellfish from three Oregon estuaries were cultured for pathogenic ""Vibrio"" species. Non-01 serovars of ""V. cholerae"" were the most common pathogenic ""Vibrio"" species, recovered from all three estuaries sampled, covering an area of about 170 miles along the Oregon coast. Non-01 ""V. cholerae"" were isolated from water and sediment at temperatures ranging from 11 to 19 deg C and salinities of 2.3 to 26 ppt; 16 isolates representing 12 different non-01 serovars were identified. Results indicate that non-01 ""V. cholerae"" serovars can be found over a large geographic area under a variety of environmental conditions; they are apparently an autochthonous component of these estuarine communities."
