14,Abstract:,"US federal stock assessments establish the catch limits from which the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) bases harvest caps to protect fishery stocks in the state waters. However, the data collection for the full stock assessment is combined for all three western states, and many nearshore species have not been assessed. Also, the local catch and stock condition information is not incorporated into models in a way that reflects smaller-scale processes important to local fisheries. Data-poor species are inherently at greater risk of overfishing because reliable estimates of population status do not exist. Therefore, it is essential to apply risk assessments to local stocks to determine the susceptibility to overfishing. One technique that incorporates biology and direct and indirect effects of fishing is the Productivity and Susceptibility Assessment (PSA), which aims to provide a biological basis for the vulnerability of a stock to fisheries impacts, scored and plotted along productivity and susceptibility indices. We will apply this technique to assess the vulnerability of Oregon’s nearshore species using biological data for local stocks and information obtained from biologists and fishermen during a series of outreach meetings and online surveys. We will conduct a PSA for selected nearshore species, and identify the appropriate spatial scale to apply the PSA."
