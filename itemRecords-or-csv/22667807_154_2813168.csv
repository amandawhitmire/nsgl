13,Abstract:,"Hosted by Oregon Sea Grant, this webinar is for students who want to explore careers in marine science. It features Jenna Sullivan-Stack, a postdoctoral scholar in the department of integrative biology in the College of Science at Oregon State University. 	Before earning her doctoral degree at OSU, she taught high school biology and life science in the Marshall Islands for a year and worked at a nonprofit organization in Florida that offers sea-based educational  experiences for children and families. For her doctoral degree, she studied the impact of climate change and disease on sea stars and other organisms in tide pools. As a postdoc, she's tying science to decisions being made about marine protected areas. 	Lindsay Carroll, who coordinates Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program, serves as the moderator on this webinar, which was recorded on December 16, 2020."
