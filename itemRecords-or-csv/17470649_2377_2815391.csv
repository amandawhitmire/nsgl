14,Abstract:,"The early to mid-1970s provided some of the best Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) fishing of the last century in Oregon, in large part a function of productive ocean conditions and a booming hatchery system. However, wild Coho populations exhibited dramatic declines toward the end of the decade and harvest rates subsequently dropped by over 75% (Martin 2009). Even after the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) implemented what was deemed at the time to be scientifically defensible harvest reductions, fisheries biologists watched as the number of returning Coho fell into severe decline over the next several years. How could an environmental catastrophe of this magnitude happen under the guardianship of a group of people who cared deeply for the public trust they managed and who were committed to using the best science available to properly manage these fish?"
