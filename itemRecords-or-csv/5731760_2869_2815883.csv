13,Abstract:,"Biologically active compounds, particularly enzymes, may be applied as processing aids in the food industry and could expand the potential for utilization of seafood by-products. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize proteinases in Pacific whiting surimi wash water to reduce organic contents and recover biologically active compounds."
