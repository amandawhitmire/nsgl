15,Abstract:,"Biotechnology offers a promising new way to produce medicinal compounds derived from seaweeds in controlled quantitites. In the biotechnologicaâ€‹l approach, liquid cell suspension cultures are first established from a seaweed which biosynthesizes the desired biomedicinal compounds. The seaweed cells are then cultivated in a bioreactor under controlled conditions to promote maximum biomass -productivity and to stimulate the controlled production of biomedicinal compounds. This work pursued the coldwater brown alga ""Laminaria saccharina"" as a candidate for bioreactor seaweed cell culture. This plant contains bioactive oxylipins deriving from 15-lipoxygenase metabolism, and also can be introduced into a vegetative, liquid cell suspension culture by established gametophyte isolation techniques."
