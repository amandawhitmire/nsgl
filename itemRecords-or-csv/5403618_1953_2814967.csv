10,Abstract:,"If you buy albacore directly off the dock, you should know how to judge its quality. The quality can vary for a number of reasons. Top quality tuna is a result of extra care on the part of the fisherman and is often worth paying a higher price. This publication offers tips to off-the-dock buyers: How do you spot good quality whole albacore? How does quality relate to the way you intend to use the fish?"
