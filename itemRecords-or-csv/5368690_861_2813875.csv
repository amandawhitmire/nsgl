11,Abstract:,"A study was initiated during the spring of 1984 to investigate the use of Netarts Bay by juvenile chum salmon, and the potential of the bay as a salmon nursery. Specific objectives were to determine (1) the use of the estuary by hatchery and wild chum salmon, (2) the residence time of chum salmon in Netarts Bay, and (3) the size at which the fish emigrated from the bay. This report presents methods and some preliminary results from the 1985 field season."
