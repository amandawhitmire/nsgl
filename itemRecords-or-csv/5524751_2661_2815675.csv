10,Abstract:,"Indigenous people throughout the world share a desire to maintain traditional subsistence economies and lifestyles. Coastal natives are concerned with the perpetuation of fishing cultures, particularly where the fishery remains economically viable. The native right to harvest fish has evolved distinctively in each of the three jurisdictions analyzed in this article. Fishing profits include access rights, insulation from government regulations, a right to a specific harvest share, and environmental protection against activities that damage fish or fish habitat. This latter right is also the means by which non-native fishers may come to see the value of governmental recognition of native rights to fish. The similarity of results in the articulation of the nature of these rights is due in large measure to the fact that the U.S., Canada, and New Zealand share the same common law roots."
