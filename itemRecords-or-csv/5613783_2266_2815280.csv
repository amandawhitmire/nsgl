12,Abstract:,"""Acrosiphonia coalita"", previously ""Spongomorpha coalita"", grows commonly in the low- to mid-intertidal region of Oregon. In an ongoing survey of the biomedicinal potential of marine algae from the west coast of the United States, the lipid extract of ""A. coalita"" was identified as containing metabolites which inhibit the growth of several microorganisms (""Bacillus subtilis"", ""Staphylococcus aureus"", and ""Candida albicans""). Large-scale extraction and chromotography led to the isolation of a novel fatty acid-derived substance which was responsible for this activity. Furthermore, a number of biogenetically related substances of unique structure were also isolated which demonstrate this alga's capacity for lipoxygenase and subsequent hydroperoxide metabolism."
