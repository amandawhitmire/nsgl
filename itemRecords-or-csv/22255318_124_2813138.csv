15,Abstract:,"This is one of six videos about how aquarists with Oregon Sea Grant care for animals at the Hatfield Marine Science Center's Visitor Center in Newport, Oregon. This video explains how the aquarists use scrubbing pads and a special vacuum to clean the sides of the tanks and the gravel in them. It also shows how cleaning tools are sanitized to prevent the spread of diseases. Oregon Sea Grant operates the Visitor Center, which features interactive exhibits and attracts more than 150,000 visitors each year. It is home to Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program for K-12 students and teachers."
