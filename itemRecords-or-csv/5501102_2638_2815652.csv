12,Abstract:,Egg white produced acceptable gel strengths when incorporated into batters of surimi prepared from Pacific whiting; soy protein isolate and whey protein concentrate did not improve gel strength in a comparable manner. Enhanced gel strengths were also observed for one-stage over two-stage heat-setting regimes in the absence of egg white. The relationships of gel strength to heating regimes supported the presence of a protease in the whiting surimi that was subject to inactivation by ovoinhibitors. The protease in Pacific whiting becomes problematic as it accumulates postmortem. An unacceptable softness of the flesh may develop in as little as 4 hr iced storage. The objective of this research was to evaluate the proteolytic activity of surimi prepared from Pacific whiting and to develop heat-set gels with acceptable texture characteristics​.
