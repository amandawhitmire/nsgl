11,Abstract:,"This brief video highlights research conducted on Oregon's Salmon River estuary to determine, in part, how juvenile salmon use estuaries and marshes as they prepare for life in the ocean. Biologist, Daniel Bottom, describes the project and its objectives. The research could benefit salmon restoration efforts by examining the role of an overlooked portion of the salmon ecosystem."
