12,Abstract:,"Biomass and halogenated monoterpene production by regenerated microplantlet suspension cultures derived from the red alga ""Ochtodes secundiramea"" were studied within a perfusion airlift photobioreactor​. The first objective of the study was to explore the effect of nutrient delivery rate on biomass productivity. The second objective was to identify all of the monoterpenes and halogenated monoterpenes within the cell biomass. The third objective was to profile halogenated monoterpene yield vs time profiles at low and high rates of nutrient delivery during perfusion cultivation."
