11,Abstract:,"The production of high quality frozen foods requires careful management of the temperature of freezers and cold stores. This paper describes a monitoring system consisting of a datalogger housed in a temperature-â€‹controlled box. The system is a portable, inexpensive device, which allows small processors and laboratories to monitor and analyse performance data during various kinds of freezing and storage."
