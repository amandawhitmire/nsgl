11,Abstract:,"Concentrations of plasma sex steroids, cortisol, and thyroxine were measured by radioimmunoassa​y in hatchery coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") during winter and early spring. Mean plasma 11-​ketotestosteron​e (11-KT) was much higher in males than in females, and estradiol was more than twice as high in females. No changes in plasma levels of estradiol in fish of both sexes, or in levels of 11-KT in males, were evident during spring when plasma thyroxine and cortisol were markedly elevated, indicating that the fish were undergoing smoltification. No relationship between a previously studied maturation steroid and plasma thyroxine or cortisol was observed. Therefore, plasma levels of sex steroids do not seem to be related to the changes in plasma thyroxine or cortisol observed during smoltification of coho salmon."
