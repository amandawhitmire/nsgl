9,Abstract:,"Analytical models based on linear wave theory and numerical fluid-structure interaction simulations are presented to assess the energy extraction potential of a direct-drive wave energy converter (WEC) with consideration of the damping effects introduced by the power take-off mechanism (PTO). A contactless force transmission system (CFTS), based on high energy density NdFeB permanent magnets, is proposed for direct coupling of floating buoys to completely enclosed PTO components. The proposed system eliminates the need to use ""continuously working seals"" in direct-drive WECs. The CFTS has been designed, modeled using finite element analysis, built and tested in a novel direct-drive concept using roller/ball screw."
