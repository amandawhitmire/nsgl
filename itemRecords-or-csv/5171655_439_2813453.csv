11,Abstract:,"This bulletin describes the quantity and nature of seafood waste from processing operations in Newport, Winchester Bay, Charleston, Bandon, Port Orford, and Brookings; and it discusses ten alternatives to discharge directly into estuaries. Other port areas were not included because of lack of funds and staff time, and because the disposal problem is less severe in those ports."
