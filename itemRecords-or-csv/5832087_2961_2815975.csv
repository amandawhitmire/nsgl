15,Abstract:,"For fish viruses, DNA vaccines have been developed for infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, both rhabdoviruses belonging to the ""Novirhabdoviru​s"" genus. As part of a controlled study to demonstrate the specificity of the immune response to the IHNV vaccine, researchers developed DNA vaccines for two other serologically distant fish rhabdoviruses, spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) and snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV). Surprisingly, both SVCV and SHRV vaccines induced protective immunity to lethal challenge with IHNV. These observations prompted an investigation into the possible reasons why the glycoprotein (G) expression of either SVCV or SHRV would induce protection against lethal challenge from an unrelated virus. Here the authors show that DNA vaccination with a G gene induces a potent interferon response in fish and propose that this is the basis for the heterologous protection."
