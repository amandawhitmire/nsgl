10,Abstract:,"Marine debris poses a threat to our environment, human health, and the economy. In 2011 a tsunami tragically washed millions of tons of personal belongings, along with other industrial and structural debris, into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Japan. Since then, Japanese tsunami marine debris both large and small has come ashore along the U.S. west coast, providing a unique window into the ways in which debris moves throughout the oceans; the risks associated with marine debris, including invasive species; and the responses people--from scientists to citizens--are making to marine debris. This is the second marine debris feature video produced by Oregon Sea Grant in a cooperative project with NOAA West and the West Coast Sea Grant programs."
