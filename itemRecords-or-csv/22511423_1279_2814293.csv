17,Abstract:,"Microplastics are an ecological stressor with implications for ecosystem and human health when present in seafood. We quantified microplastic types, concentrations, anatomical burdens, geographic distribution, and temporal differences in Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and Pacific razor clams (Siliqua patula) from 15 Oregon coast, U.S.A. sites. Microplastics were present in organisms from all sites. On average, whole oysters and razor clams contained 10.95 0.77 and 8.84 0.45 microplastic pieces per individual, or 0.35 0.04 pieces g−1 tissue and 0.16 0.02 pieces g−1 tissue, respectively. Contamination was quantified but not subtracted. Over 99% of microplastics were fibers. Material type was determined using Fourier-​transform infrared spectroscopy. Spring samples contained more microplastics than summer samples in oysters but not razor clams. Our study is the first to document microplastics in Pacific razor clams and provides important coast-wide data to compare microplastic burden across species, seasons, and sites."
18,,"Scientific Significance Statement: Plastics have innumerable uses and are inextricably tied to daily life in modern society. These plastics begin as or break down into microplastics, which are now found in an array of terrestrial, aquatic, and marine habitats and organisms. These tiny particles may threaten ecosystem balance and natural resource consumers, particularly in the case of seafood. In Oregon, U.S.A., Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and razor clams (Siliqua patula) are of commercial, recreational, and cultural importance, yet baseline information on microplastic prevalence in these species and across sites and seasons is absent. Our study is the first to document microplastics in Pacific razor clams and provides important coast-wide data to compare microplastic burden across species, seasons, and sites."
