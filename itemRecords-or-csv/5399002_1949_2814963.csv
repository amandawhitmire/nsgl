12,Abstract:,"The authors studied heat loads in fishing vessels of Atlantic Canada to establish recommendations on the use of refrigeration and insulation in fish holds. They looked at practices employed by fishermen and boatbuilders with a view to government regulations and guidelines, including the uses of mechanical refrigeration as a supplement to ice for chilling and storage of the catch. Emphasis was placed on the role of insulation, particularly in wooden vessels, which make up most of the fleet. Examination of calculated heat loads in representative cases demonstrated the efficacy of insulation and of the use of mechanical refrigeration in the hold. It also suggested, in some cases, that insulation can be considered optional when there is a risk of wood rot in an unventilated space."
