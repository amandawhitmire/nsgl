17,Abstract:,"In recent decades, waterfronts of small cities and towns across America have undergone dramatic changes--closed and abandoned mills, relocated fishing fleets and processors, changing ports. Local economies have been hurt by the deterioration and abandonment of their waterfronts. The situation is changing however. The `revitalizationâ€‹' movement is alive on the waterfront. Finding good sources of information about waterfront revitalization for small cities is difficult. Unlike their larger counterparts, small communities often don't have the planning, technical, and financial capabilities needed to mount a successful revitalization effort. This planning and redevelopment guide explores the problems and opportunities unique to smaller communities and suggests a waterfront planning process they can adapt to fit their own needs."
