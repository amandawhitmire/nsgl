17,Abstract:,"In the lowlands of the upper Willamette River Valley, Oregon, winter flooding is an annual phenomenon driven by the seasonal precipitation regime of the Pacific Northwest (Hamlet and Lettenmaier 1999). Predictable inundation of river floodplains and expansion of stream networks like these are major processes influencing entire aquatic communities (which include fish, frogs, salamanders, insects, clams, snails, and crustaceans-​such as crayfish and small shrimp like organisms) (Tockner and Stanford 2002). Flood control and improved drainage has been achieved through channel straightening, wetland filling, dike construction and ditch development (Benner and Sedell 1997). Flood control efforts, however, are not effective enough to keep many grass seed producing fields in the Willamette Valley from becoming partly submerged on an annual basis. The goal of our study was to determine wheth​er invertebrate community composition (i.e., species present) and biomass (i.e., mass of living organisms in a given area at a given time) differed between wetlands in grass seed fields and wetlands in native wet prairies as a result of the frequency of soil disturbance from tillage."
