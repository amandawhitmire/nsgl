12,Abstract:,"This is the first of two documents describing the SIMCON computer system and is further divided into three parts. Part 1 is directed toward all users of SIMCON and contains a general introduction and description of the SIMCON system and a user's guide to running a model under SIMCON. Users need not be familiar with the FORTRAN programming language to read and use this part. Part 2 is a modeler's guide to SIMCON and is designed specifically to aid the FORTRAN programmer construct, models utilizing the SIMCON language. Part 3 contains a list of run-time error messages SIMCON is capable of generating. The errors are described and possible solutions to the errors are discussed."
