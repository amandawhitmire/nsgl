11,Abstract:,"Chilled seawater (CSW) generally describes a tank full of fish, ice, and seawater. CSW systems, particularly those with bubbled air circulation, have some distinct benefits: (1) fast and definite chilling, (2) low holding temperature, (3) no crushing of the fish, (4) reduced labor (no one has to shovel ice), and (5) low cost. CSW has drawbacks, too: (1) you need more ice to chill fish and absorb heat leakage through the hold boundaries, (2) after fish die, they take up salt from the water; in some species, this can lead to a drop in quality, (3) the bulkheads need be watertight and the structure sufficiently strong to function as a flooded-hold operation, and (4) a vessel not designed for a flooded hold may have a serious problem with stability."
