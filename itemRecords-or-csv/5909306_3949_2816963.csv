11,Abstract:,"A three-day program brought together 200 researchers, managers and others from around the world to discuss the management of dredged material. Workshops focused specifically on Confined Aquatic Disposal cells, beneficial uses of dredged material such as for wetlands creation or erosion control, and evaluation of risk assessment tools to test for sediment toxicity. Conference sessions included presentations on these topics as well as Confined Disposal Facilities and a variety of policy and management issues. Over 30 papers and 50 abstracts are compiled here."
