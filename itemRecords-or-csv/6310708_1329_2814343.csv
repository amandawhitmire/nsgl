12,Abstract:,"Nearshore Central Oregon waters provide necessary juvenile habitat for a variety of fishes including several species of flatfish, rockfish, sculpin, and poacher. Over the past decade these waters have seen an increase in nearshore hypoxia induced by coastal upwelling. Studies have shown that exposure to low dissolved oxygen (DO) can have negative impacts on fishes including but not limited to decreased metabolic rates, increased predation risk, decreased prey capture, and changes in community structure. In this study, we explored the effects of DO on catch per unit effort (CPUE), diversity, and body condition of several juvenile demersal species of fish off the Central Oregon Coast. Samples were collected during three years (2008-2010) at four stations along the Newport Hydrographic Line over four different depths (from 30 to 80 m) using a 2 m-wide beam trawl with a 3 mm mesh codend. Using multivariate and univariate statistical approaches data were inspected for evidence of changes in community composition, species abundance patterns, individual body size and conditions in relation to varying levels of DO. Additional variables included in the analysis are depth and distance from shore and water temperature. Our results will help to understand the impacts that low DO may have on juvenile demersal species and their subsequent adult populations."
