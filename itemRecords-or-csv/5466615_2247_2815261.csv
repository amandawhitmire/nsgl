9,Abstract:,"MOSS is a geographic information system in the public domain, used by government agencies and the private sector to aid in the spatial analysis of complex natural and cultural resource management issues. The MOSS family of software includes two data entry systems, a vector analysis system, a raster analysis system, and a cartographic production system. MOSS's uses are numerous; it has proven its effectiveness in aiding managers to make resource management and land-use decisions. Products generated with this software have been used in legal proceedings and have supplemented testimony before several Congressional committees. The evaluation of MOSS is concerned not simply with its successes, but with its improvements and its design for the future. This workship specifically was designed to incorporate data integration, software development, and data management issues generally not addressed at many conferences. Twenty-four papers and one video detailed the past year's accomplishments and the promises for the future."
