10,Abstract:,"Demonstration I: Water Density. Students will recognize the role water density plays in creating water masses and water movement in the ocean. In Demonstration II, students will know that fresh water is less dense than salty water and warm water is less dense than cold water. In Demonstration III - Upwelling, students will be able to understand the forces which create upwelling."
