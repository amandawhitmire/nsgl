11,Abstract:,"In steel fishing vessels common to the U.S., three factors significantly affect heat flow patterns through the fish hold boundaries. The first is insulation thickness, which varies significantly in practice. The second is penetration of steel frames, which act as `thermal bridges' across the insulated section, dramatically increasing heat flow in some cases. The third factor relates to materials and fasteners for the inside liners. Objectives of research reported here have been to better understand factors influencing thermal resistance of fish hold sections and to better appreciate potential hazards of poor insulation practices. An analysis of the heat transfer of fish hold section configurations concentrated on U.S. west coast steel fishing vessels in the size range of 14 to 32 m (45 to 105 ft)."
