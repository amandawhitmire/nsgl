9,Abstract:,"Troll fishers are often faced with having to release bycaught rockfish. If the boat is in motion, it must be stopped to release the fish -- consuming precious time and fuel. A simple, inexpensive solution is to use a disposable gaff. The gaff is easy to use from a moving boat -- just hook the fish through its upper lip and drop gaff and fish into the water."
