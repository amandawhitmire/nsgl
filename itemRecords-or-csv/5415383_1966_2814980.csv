10,Abstract:,"Most information about force transfer coefficients for cylinders in waves or in steady flow is based on smooth cylinders or cylinders uniformly roughened with glued-on sand. Biofouling, however, can be very irregular, have a much thicker accumulation, and protrude much further into the flow field from the cylinder surface than any sand coated cylinder ever tested. In order to gather wave force information on cylinders roughened with real marine growths, three 8-5/8 inch diameter steel cylinders were positioned 55, 140 and 190 feet below the water surface at a platform positioned in the Gulf of Mexico near the mouth of the Mississippi River. Three cylinders were positioned at each level so that they could be tested after 1, 2, and 3 years growth. This paper reports on the results obtained from the 1-year old cylinders."
