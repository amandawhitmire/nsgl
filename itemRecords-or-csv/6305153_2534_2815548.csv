8,Abstract:,"The ""Sink or Swim"" exhibit (displayed at the Hatfield Marine Science Center Visitor Center in Newport, Oregon) is an interactive game which puts the player in the role of a larval walleye pollock. The player can advance through the pollock's life stages to maturity, but only by carefully avoiding predators and finding food."
