11,Abstract:,"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a major pathogen of several economically important fish species. The virus is found endemically in Atlantic salmon in Europe, where it is associated with disease in adult animals, and it can produce epizootics in hatchery-reared rainbow and brook trout fry. Studies on the bacterial expression of the IPN virion proteins were conducted as part of an effort to develop a viral subunit vaccine. The Sp strain of the virus was selected because that virus strain is endemic in Europe. This study shows that the precursor polyprotein is processed when the entire IPNV-A segment is expressed in ""Escherichia coli,"" a completely foreign host. In addition, when the entire A segment was expressed in bacteria as a ""trp""E fusion protein, large quantities of the 3 viral proteins were synthesized. Rainbow trout fry vaccinated with a bacterial lysate containing the expressed viral proteins were protected against lethal challenge with virulent IPNV."
