12,Abstract:,"Closely related to the current general interest in our environment is a new fascination with the resources of the sea. What can we expect to receive from the sea'? What do we stand to lose if the resources of the open seas are not managed properly? What can we do to gain more or lose less of the common wealth of the ocean'? This particular study examines one source of ocean wealth - seafood - in the United States, particularly in the state of Oregon."
