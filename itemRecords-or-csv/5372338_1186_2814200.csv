14,Abstract:,"A school of 41 sperm whales, ""Physeter macrocephalus"", consisting of 13 males and 28 females, were stranded near the mouth of the Siuslaw River, Oregon on 16 June 1979. Such rare mass strandings of sperm whales offer unique opportunities to examine their social structure; therefore an effort was made to collect as many data as possible. Ages were estimated by assuming that each postnatal dentin layer represents one year. The males were all sub-adults, 9.3-11.5 m long and 14-21 yr old, females were 9.3-11.4 m long and 11 to about 58 yr old. Ten females were dissected; nine were sexually mature and three were carrying fetuses 2.64-4.62 m long. None of the 28 females was visibly lactating."
