13,Abstract:,"Seaweeds are a source of natural products, particularly bioactive compounds, with medicinal properties. Cell and tissue cultures established from anatomically complex marine seaweeds have the potential to biologically synthesize these compounds at a commercial scale. In pursuit of this goal, the authors have developed several phototrophic cell and tissue culture systems representing brown, green, and red seaweeds. This brief article summarizes the research."
