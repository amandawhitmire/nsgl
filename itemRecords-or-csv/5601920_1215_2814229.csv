14,Abstract:,"Columbia River Basin salmonids are exposed to the parasite ""Ceratomyxa shasta"" during both their seaward and return migrations. The impact of ceratomyxosis on the survival of migrating fish is difficult to assess because there are few data on causes of fish mortality once fish are released from the hatchery. This study examines the impact of this disease on juvenile salmonids by (1) sampling the downstream migrants to determine what percent of fish leaving the basin are infected with the parasite, and (2) determining the effects of entering salt water on the progress of the infection. Results of comparisons of methods for diagnosing a ""C. shasta"" infection indicate that serological techniques using monoclonal antibodies are more sensitive than techniques for examination of spores."
