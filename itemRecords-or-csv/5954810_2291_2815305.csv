12,Abstract:,"In the research of human occupation on the Northwest coast during the late Pleistocene, the specific effects and timing of postglacial coastline change and alluvial adjustment are not well understood. Addressing this problem, scientists report the results of subsurface sediment coring at a locality approximately 2 km from the Pacific Ocean on the Sixes River in southern Oregon and the implications for discovering early sites in coastal river valleys. They find evidence that late Pleistocene deposits are indeed deeply buried, posing a challenge that must be considered an inherent aspect of investigating potential early coastal sites."
