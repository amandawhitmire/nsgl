11,Abstract:,"Although each year a greater number of sportsmen are clamming and angling in Oregon's bays, it is surprising how few have ever tried crab fishing. A little know how and a minimum of extra gear almost guarantee catch results, Seasons are open year 'round, and about the only time bay crabs are not available is when extreme freshets lower water salinity, forcing crabs oceanward to saltier water."
