11,Abstract:,"Spacing of scale ridges (circuli) is a potentially valuable tool for comparing growth rates of fish where other data are not available. Spacing of scale circuli is determined by both the rate at which circuli are formed and the rate of growth of the scale. Whether scale circulus spacing can be used to estimate fish growth rate depends on whether scale growth and circulus deposition rate are related to fish growth rate in a consistent, predictable manner. This study investigated the relationships between scale radius and fish length, between rate of circulus formation and fish and scale growth rates, and between circulus spacing and fish and scale growth rates in three groups of young coho salmon."
