12,Abstract:,"Scombroid poisoning results from ingestion of foods containing high levels of histamine and is one of the three most frequently reported illnesses associated with seafood consumption in the U.S. In this study, iced and previously frozen albacore tuna (""Thunnus alalunga"") were monitored for histamine formation and bacterial growth during storage at 0-37 deg. C. The optimum temperature for histamine formation was 25 deg. C and whole fish were more susceptible to histamine formation than dressed fish at that temperature when albacore were frozen prior to storage, reduced amount of histamine was found. No histamine was found in any of the albacore samples stored in ice for 18 days."
