11,Abstract:,"""Piscirickettsiâ€‹a salmonis"" is the first of the previously unrecognized rickettsial fish pathogens to be isolated, characterized, and demonstrated to be the etiologic agent of an epizootic disease. Since the isolation of ""P. salmonis"" in 1989, the scope and impact of these pathogens has become increasingly apparent. Documentation of rickettsial diseases in diverse species of fish and in disparate geographic locations and aquatic environments has grown. However, considerable work remains in order to establish the source, reservoir, and normal mode(s) of transmission of these agents and to devise appropriate methods of disease prevention and control."
