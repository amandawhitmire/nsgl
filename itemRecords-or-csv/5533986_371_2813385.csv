11,Abstract:,"The Anadromous Fish Law Memo is an aperiodic publication of the Lewis and Clark Law School's Natural Resources Law Institute supported in part by the OSU Sea Grant Program. In this issue: Anadromous Fish Law--1979-1990. This issue culminates over a decade of analysis and commentary on laws affecting efforts to preserve and restore the anadromous fish runs of the Pacific Northwest. Although this publication terminates with this issue, the challenge of preservation and restoration remains very large. We hope that other students and teachers decide to pursue this rewarding area of law and policy analysis, and that policy makers take action commensurate with the environmental and economic importance of anadromous fish to the sport, commerce, culture, and identity of the Pacific Northwest. The next ten years may well determine whether wild salmon remain part of the fabric of the region or are, like the Snake River coho runs, a mere memory, sacrificed in pursuit of other goals."
