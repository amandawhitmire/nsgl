11,Abstract:,"The authors describe a new PCR-based method for distinguishing human and cow fecal contamination in coastal waters without culturing indicator organisms, and show that the method can be used to track bacterial marker sequences in complex environments. They identified two human-specific genetic markers and five cow-specific genetic markers in fecal samples by amplifying 16S ribosomal DNA fragments from members of the genus ""Bifidobacteriu​m"" and the ""Bacteroides-​Prevotella"" group and performing length heterogeneity PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. Host-specific patterns suggested that there are species composition differences in the ""Bifidobacteriu​m"" and ""Bacteroides-​Prevotella"" populations of human and cow feces. Additionally, all host-specific genetic markers were detected in water samples collected from areas frequently contaminated with fecal pollution. Although their aim was to identify nonpoint sources of fecal contamination, the method described here should be widely applicable for monitoring spatial and temporal fluctuations in specific bacterial groups in natural environments."
