11,Abstract:,"Purposes. Touch tanks containing marine and aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates are a ubiquitous and popular feature of public, informal science venues like aquariums, zoos and science centers (Ross, Norman, & Dorsch, 2003). This paper frames touch tanks as settings for moving children and adults from being everyday observers to scientific observers, examining activities and discourse emergent in family interaction that might be leveraged in helping move visitors from novice to expert observation. Theoretical framework. We approach interactions with touch tanks as mediated action (Wertsch, 1998; Wertsch, del Rio, & Alvarez, 1995). From this point of view, with its roots in activity theory (Vygotsky, 1987; Leontev, 1978; Wertsch, 1988), learning occurs through interactions mediated by physical and psychological tools (including live animals) and symbols (most often language). A mediated action framework encourages us to see science learning as engagement in socially shared practices mediated by the language and interactional routines used by docents, printed materials, and visitors. Here we report family practices associated with observation using Eberbach and Crowleys (2009) framework for categorizing observation to document the roles of noticing, expectations, observation records, and productive dispositions in shaping family interactions and characterizing their learning. Methods and data sources. Participants (n=40 groups) were video- and audio-taped at touch tanks at four sites on the US west coast. Video collection was equally distributed among the four study sites. Field notes were recorded by hand during the videotaping, and a fifteen-minute exit interview was audio recorded. Results. Evidence from both observations and interviews suggests that participants consistently engage in practices of everyday observations and that docents and staff occasionally model or introduce transitional or even more scientific observation practices. There is, however, very little evidence for purposeful scaffolding of visitors interactions toward scientific observation. We also present evidence that the touch tanks are excellent sites for leveraging visitors naming routines, productive dispositions, and expectations to help move toward more scientific observation practices. Significance. This study addresses a gap in knowledge about the learning made possible by touch tanks used by public aquariums of almost every size. Examining family interaction and learning and how everyday practices might be used as springboards to scientific practices gives us basic insights into how everyday observational practices might be leveraged for science learning in a wide variety of settings."
