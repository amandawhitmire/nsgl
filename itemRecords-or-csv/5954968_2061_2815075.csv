13,Abstract:,"Users of stationary blast freezers in food processing know that the freezers consume huge amounts of energy. Two ways to conserve energy are to optimize airflow and control fan speed. This article provides step-by-step instructions, with photos and charts, for evaluating present parameters, and determining and implementing such improvements."
