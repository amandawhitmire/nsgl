14,Abstract:,"This session presents a variety of unique approaches for utilizing informal science education settings to support the development of future teachers, along with evidence for program impacts and suggestions for improving ILE collaboration projects. Each of the panelists, affiliated with a university-â€‹based teacher preparation program, will briefly report on how different experiences in ILEs were used to enhance future teacher understanding of their students, their practice, and the potential role of ILEs to support their efforts in the classroom. Both quantitative and qualitative data is used to demonstrate strengths and weaknesses of these different approaches. Discussion will then focus on both the affordances and constraints when considering such collaborative efforts, as well as the importance of using a broad lens when considering how best to support the teaching and learning of science across settings."
