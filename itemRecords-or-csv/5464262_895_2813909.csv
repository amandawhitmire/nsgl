14,Abstract:,"A three-year study that included at-sea observations aboard commercial trawl vessels indicates that significant quantities of fish were discarded between 1985 and 1987 as a result of single-species trip quotas. The rate of discard varied among species and time periods and tended to increase as trip regulations became more restrictive. The management regime failed to meet its two major goals: to conserve key species and to maintain a year-round groundfish fishery. Given the failure of the current system to meet management goals, it would appear warranted to explore some alternatives: (1) modifying the trip poundage quota system, (2) eliminating trip quotas and establishing quarterly or trimesterly quotas, (3) replacing trip poundage limits with trip time limits, (4) relying to a greater degree on gear regulations in management, (5) limiting the number of participants in the fishery, (6) modifying the objectives of management, (7) some combination of the above. This report was prepared at the request of staff of the Pacific Fishery Management Council and several of its advisory bodies in order to provide timely information to the Council on the effectiveness of past management practices. The results reported are preliminary and. subject to change, and focus on one aspect of an ongoing comprehensive bioeconomic study of the west coast trawl fishery. A more detailed final report is being prepared for distribution at a later date."
