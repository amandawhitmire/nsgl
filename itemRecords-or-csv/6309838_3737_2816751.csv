15,Abstract:,"Hypoxia has emerged as a prominent research and management issue in coastal marine and large-lake ecosystems worldwide, primarily owing to human-driven eutrophication. Our understanding of hypoxia's impacts on aquatic organisms, particularly pelagic fishes, is limited, however. Herein, we present findings from an investigation of hypoxia's impact on two pelagic planktivores, the rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax and the emerald shiner Notropis atherinoides, in central Lake Erie, wherein hypoxia is a naturally occurring phenomenon but which has experienced a recent increase in spatial extent and duration. We hypothesized that the consequences of bottom hypoxia, both in the short- and long-term, would be less for emerald shiners (ES) than rainbow smelt (RS), owing to interspecific differences in evolved anti-predator behaviors (i.e., surface [ES] vs. bottom [RS] schooling during day) and thermal requirements for growth (i.e., warmwater [ES] vs. coldwater [RS]), as well as invasion history (and hence, exposure to hypoxia in Lake Erie; native [ES] vs. naturalized [RS]). To test this hypothesis, we combined a spatially-​explicit bioenergetics-​based habitat modeling approach with long-term (1990-2008) monitoring data and intensive field observations (during 2005) of fish spatial distributions, vertical migration patterns, feeding behavior, growth, and condition (health) before, during, and after hypoxia."
