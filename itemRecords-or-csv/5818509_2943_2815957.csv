12,Abstract:,"One functional property of fish protein is its gel-forming ability. Among factors affecting fish protein gelation, endogenous enzymes greatly contribute to structural changes of fish myofibrillar proteins negatively (by protease) or positively (by transglutaminasâ€‹e). Activity of these enzymes can be controlled using a proper heating method. The authors of this paper discuss general principles of ohmic heating, gelation of fish proteins, linear heating patterns of ohmic heating, and gelation properties of fish proteins under ohmic heating."
