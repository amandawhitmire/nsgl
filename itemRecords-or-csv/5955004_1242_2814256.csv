13,Abstract:,"Fishery regulations for Oregon ocean shrimp ""Pandalus jordani"" are designed to protect age 1 shrimp from overharvest and sustain long-term fishery benefits. Designing appropriate management regulations including minimum mesh size and season dates is complicated by the interaction of natural mortality, fishing mortality, and market factors including prices and revenues. The effects of these variables on management strategies were evaluated using yield per recruit and revenue per recruit models. The model that maximized yield indicated that an early season- opening date was optimal; however, due to size dependent ex-vessel prices, the revenue model suggested that a season-opening delay could generate higher total revenues, while decreasing total effort and total harvest. These results demonstrate that, depending on management objectives, incorporating market information may have a significant effect on selection of regulatory controls in this fishery."
