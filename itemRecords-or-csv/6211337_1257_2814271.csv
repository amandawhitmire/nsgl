9,Abstract:,"Oregon Sea Grant's Strategic Plan for 2010-2013 is the overarching guiding document for the program. It defines the program's goals and strategies for addressing key issues important to Oregonians, the region, and the nation. The process of developing and publishing a strategic plan helps us focus and unify our thinking and communicate our priorities to our many partners and stakeholders. We look to this document to guide decision making and resource allocation and lead the program in achieving the greatest possible benefits."
