12,Abstract:,"West Coast fishing families and businesses traditionally have been very resilient. However, with more focus on the management, protection, and restoration of fishery resources, it's harder to bounce back when cycles are low. In addition, making good business and family decisions becomes more difficult as the number of unknowns increases. This workbook is designed to provide fishing families with practical help in monitoring where their money goes; creating a personalized expense tracking system for both the business and the family; keeping accurate records for tax preparation; and reducing stress and conflict around finances."
