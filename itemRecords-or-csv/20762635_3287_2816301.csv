16,Abstract:,"In this chapter, researchers synthesize field surveys and a suite of interdisciplina​ry laboratory, mesocosm, and computer modeling experiments that examine the relative role of vegetation in determining dune geomorphology in the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW). Researchers focus on how dunes of different shapes result in variable levels of exposure to coastal hazards. Results suggest that PNW dune shape is primarily a function of sediment supply and the geographic distribution of two species of non-native beach grasses (Ammophila arenaria and A. breviligulata)."
