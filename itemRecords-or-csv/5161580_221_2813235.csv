13,Abstract:,"This report, while not a complete compilation of facts about the natural resources and related features of Oregon's estuaries, provides a summary of much of the known information about the estuaries and gives numerous citations of literature and agencies from which supporting information may be obtained. The report is intended to provide the planner with a ""starting point"" for assembling the required data concerning most of the Oregon estuaries."
