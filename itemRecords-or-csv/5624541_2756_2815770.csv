11,Abstract:,"During the past decade there was an enormous increase in the number of eicosanoid-like metabolites discovered from marine life, particularly red algae and corals. Despite the widespread occurrence of marine eicosanoids, very little is known about what role these compounds play in the ecology or physiology of the producing organisms. To the extent that marine-derived eicosanoid-like substances have been evaluated for useful pharmacological properties, they are a potently active class. This paper reviews the eicosanoid-like substances reported from marine algae and the subsequent in-depth biosynthetic and pharmacological follow-up studies."
