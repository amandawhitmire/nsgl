12,Abstract:,"Mature and juvenile salmon were collected by purse seine. Net migration rate was estimated by dividing net movement by days between release and recovery. Recoveries of coho salmon released off Oregon were mainly from the Columbia River (81%). Only 11% were recovered in the Strait of Juan de Fuca or Puget Sound. Recoveries of coho released off Washington were more widely distributed. Net migration rates of maturing tagged coho were generally very low. The slow net migration rates, prolonged residence in coastal waters, and mixed north and south net movements suggest that maturing coho salmon of coastal Oregon and Washington, unlike more northern stocks, are not highly migratory with precisely directed and timed movements. In contrast, most tagged maturing chinook salmon moved to the south after release."
