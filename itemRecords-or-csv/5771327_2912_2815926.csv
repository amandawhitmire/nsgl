10,Abstract:,Crewmen on fishing boats are usually considered self- employed by the Internal Revenue Service. They are responsible for filing federal and state tax returns and paying the taxes they owe. Boat owners are required to send IRS Form 1099 to crewmen by January 31 and to the IRS by February 28. This flyer directs commercial fishing crewmen to more information on taxes and tax record keeping.
