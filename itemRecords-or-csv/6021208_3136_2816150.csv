9,Abstract:,"Mapping and stratigraphic investigations of back barrier, open- coastal plain sites have been used to establish minimum inundation distances and wave heights of tsunami produced by great subduction zone earthquakes in the central Cascadia margin. Cascadia tsunami deposits have been reported for many coseismic subsidence events in bay marsh settings where tidal-channel features focus tsunami energy. Variable magnitude (8.5 +/-0.5 Mw), frequency (500 +/-300 yr recurrence), and rupture geometry produce widely varying computer model outcomes for Cascadia tsunami inundation. The results presented in this thesis provide specific quantitative data regarding tsunami inundation at the open coast. Anomalous sand sheets that have been characterized consist of well-sorted beach sand that fine up-section. The thickness of the deposits vary from 45 cm to .2 cm, and thin in the landward direction. Many of the sand layers include detrital caps. One to three detritus and mud lamina are intra-layered in the deposits. Marine diatoms and bromine, a marine tracer, increase in concentration at each of the sand layers. C14 dating of select layers suggest correlation to great Cascadia, earthquake-​induced, coseismic subsidence events. The sand layers are inferred to be tsunami deposited, synchronous with coseismic subsidence events. Core traverses record four, and in some cases up to seven Cascadia tsunami events. One sand layer found at many sites is dated at 600-950 cal YBP, an age that lacks a recognized coseismic horizon in the northern Cascadia margin. Soil chronosequencin​g and dated subsurface erosional scarps have been used to constrain paleo-dune elevation and shoreline position. Minimum paleo-dune height ranges from 5 to 8 m. Minimum overland inundation distance at the various sites ranges from 0.3 to 1.3 km +/- .2 km. The tsunami origins of landward-most sand laminae are tested by marine diatom and bromine anomalies. These tracers are being used to extend paleotsunami flooding records to include low- velocity inundation distances."
