14,Abstract:,"Pacific whiting (""Merluccius productus"") is the most abundant fishery resource off the west coast of the U.S.; the major portion is used to produce surimi. Beef plasma proteins, egg white, and other food grade enzyme inhibitors have been used to inhibit proteolytic activity. However, these enzyme inhibitors used commercially have some negative effects. In tests reported here, degradation of myosin and actin was minimized by ohmic heating, resulting in a continuous network structure. Ohmic heating with a rapid heating rate was an effective method for maximizing gel functionality of Pacific whiting surimi without enzyme inhibitors."
