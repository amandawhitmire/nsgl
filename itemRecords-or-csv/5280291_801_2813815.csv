15,Abstract:,"NOGERO is a computer simulation of a mythical people who obtain their subsistence from clams, salmon, and halibut. No one culture served as a model for the NOGERO. They are a composite of many cultures commonly studied in introductory anthropology courses. Like all peoples, the NOGERO face hazards due to accidents, disease, and natural calamities. Your objective is to make decisions that promote NOGERO survival and well-being. Four decisions are available to achieve this goal. The decisions are the MOVE, SPLIT, FEAST, and BOATS commands."
