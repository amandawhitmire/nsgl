12,Abstract:,"U.S. fishery management is in the midst of a transition that will significantly change the marine fishing commons. It is a transition that requires changes in traditional institutional approaches and in the scale, scope, and process of management. These changes are taking place in the face of management contention and prohibitions on the use of certain management tools, such as private property rights. The changes are layered over a management structure and historical context that carry their own momentum. All challenge the transition. This mixture of new requirements, current practice, and historical expectations characterizes the complexities of the transition and the challenges it presents."
