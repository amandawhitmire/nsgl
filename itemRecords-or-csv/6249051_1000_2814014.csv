12,Abstract:,"People know very little about oceans and ocean sciences. This presentation gives survey results of what students and the general public know about how salmon, crab, halibut, shrimp are caught and where they live. It discusses working science knowledge and free-choice learning. It talks about math in the science center, sea surface temperature, Chlorophyll-a Data, wind speed data, and the WOW factor: people love pretty pictures."
