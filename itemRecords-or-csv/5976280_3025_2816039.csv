12,Abstract:,"Recently, researchers developed reliable routes for establishing phototrophic cell and tissue cultures derived from macrophytic marine red algae using callus induction and somoclonal regeneration techniques, focusing on ""Agardhiella subulata"" as the model plant. They determined that the regenerated microplantlet suspension culture system was well suited for bioprocess development. In this study, ""A. subulata"" microplantlets were cultivated in a bubble-column photobioreactor under liquid medium perfusion. Potential limiting factors on biomass productivity, including macronutrient (N, P) delivery, carbon dioxide transfer, light transfer, and the friability of the plantlet tissues in aerated suspension were addressed. The study also measured the oxygen evolution rate, a real-time measure of photosynthesis leading to algal biomass production. A new photobioreactor growth model was developed to predict the biomass growth curve from the specific oxygen evolution rate vs time profile."
