8,Abstract:,"Discover how a food web works by making a live model, using the people in your class. Then explore how an invasive species disrupts that balance. In this fun, active-​learning, game about food webs, each student is assigned to be a plant or animal that can be found in aquatic ecosystems. Then, they learn about the relationships between organisms as they pass a ball of yarn between students (organisms) that have a predator/prey relationship. As the ball of yarn unravels and the string is stretched between the many predator/prey relationships in the room, the large and complex food web network is reveals visually and symbolically in the room. In the final step, an invasive species is added to the room and, due to its ability to out compete the other organisms, cuts the yarn connecting the students together. The invasive species effectively destroys the classroom food web."
