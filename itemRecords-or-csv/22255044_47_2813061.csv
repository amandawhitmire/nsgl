15,Abstract:,"This is one of six videos about how aquarists with Oregon Sea Grant care for animals at the Hatfield Marine Science Center's Visitor Center in Newport, Oregon. This video explains how new and sick animals are quarantined and treated in the behind-​the-​scenes area known as the west wing. The west wing is also where shrimp and rotifers are raised as food for baby fish like pipefish. It is also where Oregon Sea Grant's aquatic veterinarian teaches aquarium science students and where sea stars stay to boost their immune systems. Oregon Sea Grant operates the Visitor Center, which features interactive exhibits and attracts more than 150,000 visitors each year. It is home to Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program for K-12 students and teachers."
