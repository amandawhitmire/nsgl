11,Abstract:,"Scientists often portray data as visualizations in order to reveal salient patterns. Rowe's previous work indicates that scientific conventions in these images need translation for the public to make sense of the information, just as technical jargon needs translation to lay language in stories in the news media. Here, we investigate visitors to a marine science center as they use an exhibit to try to make meaning of these visualizations presented in a spherical display with interpretive text and images. We draw on both a constructivist framework that suggests, in order to make meaning, visitors must use prior knowledge and experiences, and a sociocultural perspective that postulates visitors make meaning through dialogue and the use of tools such as the images. Using unobtrusive and videotaped and interviews with video-â€‹stimulated recall, we ask whether these visitors 1) work to make meaning as groups, 2) recall details presented in accompanying text, 3) understand the color schemes used in the images, and 4) have more interactions with and/or better understand particular images. Our findings indicate that many visitors did talk together about the exhibit content, but that the images still remained obscure due to unfamiliar color schemes and lack of geographic markers. Though many did verbalize prior knowledge during their interactions, most groups were unable to recall details presented in the interpretive text. While the spherical display with interactive kiosk proved engaging, more work to scaffold meaning-making from the images by reducing processing spent on less-relevant contextual details is warranted."
