9,Abstract:,"Did you know that octopuses not only have eight arms but also have three hearts? Or that octopuses are great escape artists, able to squeeze through any small space they can fit their beaks through? Or that the giant Pacific octopus can grow up to 16 feet across and weigh up to 110 pounds? These are just a few of the interesting things you'll learn when you read this two-page fact sheet, Giant Pacific Octopus. You'll also learn what scientific classifications the giant Pacific octopus belongs to; why the plural is ""octopuses"" instead of ""octopi""; how many suckers female and male octopuses have; what an octopus has in common with a house cat; where octopuses live; where the octopus's mouth is and what it eats; how an octopus catches, paralyzes, and eats live prey; what animals eat octopuses; what an octopus's ""ink"" really does; how octopuses can change color; how octopuses make more octopuses; and a lot more!"
