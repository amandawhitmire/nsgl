11,Abstract:,"Thermal conductivity, specific heat and density of Pacific whiting surimi paste with varying moisture content were measured and modelled over the cooking temperature range. Both thermal conductivity and specific heat were found to increase with increasing moisture content and temperature. Surimi density was found to decrease with increasing moisture content and temperature. Empirical models, based on quadratic functions of temperature and moisture content, were fitted to the experimental data for each property."
