12,Abstract:,"There are numerous reports on the occurrence of conjugated dienoic, trienoic, and tetraenoic fatty acids in plants, most of which are 18-carbon compounds originating from oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, or stearidonic acid. The biosynthesis of these conjugated polyenes from their fatty acid precursors, however, is still poorly understood. This paper reports that the biosynthesis of conjugated triene-​containing fatty acids by the red alga ""Ptilota filicina"" is catalyzed by a novel enzyme, polyenoic fatty acid isomerase. The enzyme has been highly purified and is described here for the first time."
