12,Abstract:,"A research, planning and outreach initiative is underway to increase the resiliency of Pacific Northwest ports and harbor to catastrophic earthquakes and tsunamis. One element is a natural hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness planning process that combines technical expertise with local stakeholder values and perceptions. This paper summarizes and examines one component of the process, the vulnerability assessment methodology, used in the pilot port and harbor community of Yaquina River, Oregon, as a case study of assessing vulnerability at the local level."
