11,Abstract:,"Beginning in 1998, anomalous wave-induced erosion on Oregon beach platforms uncovered the remains of trees buried and preserved 2-4 thousand years ago. Lack of evidence of prior colonization by marine life indicates that the forest remnants had been nearly continuously covered by sand since burial. This report is part of the authors' ongoing research into the current episode of sand erosion."
