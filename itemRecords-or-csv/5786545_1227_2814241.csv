9,Abstract:,"This classic promotional film, produced by the Bonneville Power Administration n 1939, touted the benefits of damming the Columbia for hydropower. Scenes of the construction of Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dams are dramatic and strongly argue for the social benefits associated with hydropower. The comparatively low rates that public utility customers would pay for hydropower are emphasized, but the costs of such development to salmon, river ecosystems, and native people were either minimized or not understood. This 34 minute video 'reprint' is a fascinating visual, historic, and social document, suitable for secondary school through adult audiences."
