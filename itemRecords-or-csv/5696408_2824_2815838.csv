13,Abstract:,"The use of masculinized female salmonids (XX males) to produce all- female populations is now a well-documented method for control of sex in aquaculture systems. Masculinization usually involves the use of the synthetic androgen 17 alpha-​methyltestoster​one (MT). However, the naturally occuring steroid 11 beta-​hydroxyandroste​nedione (OHA) resulted in transient masculinization of rainbow trout when fish were either immersed in or fed the steroid. This study was designed to determine whether a gynogenetic group of rainbow trout could be sex-reversed to males with intact sperm ducts by using MT or OHA. The study also sought to determine when fish were most sensitive to the masculinizing effects of the androgens, whether multiple doses resulted in greater masculinization​, and if masculinization females were capable of producing 100% female offspring."
