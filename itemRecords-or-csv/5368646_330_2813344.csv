14,Abstract:,"A cruise was conducted in June, 1985 (for the seventh straight year) to study the distribution, abundance, migration, growth, and feeding habits of juvenile salmonids during their first summer in the ocean off Oregon and Washington. Sampling was concentrated near the Columbia River Plume during the first week of the cruise; thereafter, a coastwide survey of the ocean off Oregon and Washington was conducted along standard transects."
