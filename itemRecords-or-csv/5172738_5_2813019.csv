15,Abstract:,"As with previous Sea Grant conferences, the major goal of the Third National Sea Grant Conference was strengthening Sea Grant nationwide by openly discussing and critically evaluating our activities. In such an atmosphere, there are several avenues that help contribute to strong and vigorous programs. An important avenue is the contact that occurs among representatives of participating Sea Grant institutions that offers an opportunity to learn about programs being conducted in other parts of the country. Such exchange of information helps to avoid duplication of effort and enhances existing programs by fostering more rapid diffusion of information about them. Another avenue to program improvement offered by a conference such as this is the opportunity for direct input from the industrial and business sectors that are concerned with the direction Sea Grant takes. Sea Grant institutions learn more quickly the needs of industry; industry, in turn, finds out about progress that may offer opportunities for profit, Programs on the conference agenda were concerned with food and non-food resources. Participants were drawn from state and federal agencies, industry, universities, and other institutions with an interest in marine sciences. There was a real and successful attempt to get input from the men actively engaged in wresting a living from the sea. For example, active participants were leading fishermen. The nature of the material presented at the conference and reported here is indicative of the cooperative spirit of state and federal efforts to develop the resources of the oceans. A public awareness of the nature and results of these efforts will do much to further the goals of the National Sea Grant Program. Involving all interested groups in a National Sea Grant Conference leads to even better understanding and to a sharpened definition of our goal of the wise, planned use of the resources of the oceans."
