12,Abstract:,"""Gloiosiphonia verticillaris"" is an annual red marine alga abundant in Oregon in the early summer, typically found in low intertidal areas scoured by sand. The crude lipid extract of this alga exhibited antimicrobial activity against ""Staphyloccus aureus"", ""Bacillus subtilis"", ""Escherichia coli"", and ""Salmonella typhimurium"". However, during efforts to isolate the antimicrobial natural products from a portion of the active material, most of the activity was lost, presumably due to the instability of these compounds to activated Si gel chromatography. Gloiosiphones A and B were, however, isolated and their structures were assigned on the basis of spectral analysis."
