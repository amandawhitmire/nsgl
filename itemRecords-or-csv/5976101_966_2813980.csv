11,Abstract:,"If you buy albacore directly off the dock, you should know how to judge its quality. Top-quality tuna is a result of extra care on the part of the fisherman, and often is worth paying for. This fact sheet offers tips to off-the-dock buyers: how to spot high-quality whole albacore; how quality relates to the way you intend to use the fish; what you need to know about fresh and frozen tuna."
