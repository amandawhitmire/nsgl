10,Abstract:,"Heavy minerals generally are concentrated by the swash of waves on the beach face, preferentially carrying the light minerals offshore and leaving the heavy minerals behind. Sorting is primarily due to selective entrainment and transport of the mineral grains according to their densities and sizes. Shear sorting due to grain-â€‹dispersive pressures concentrates the heavy minerals within individual laminae, but it remains to be shown that this process, together with erosion of the beach face, can lead to the formation of a significant placer. Sorting by grain-settling velocities appears to govern in part the overall ranges of grain sizes and densities of sand found in the nearshore. Much of the energy of a wave swash is contained within long-period infragravity motions rather than at periods of the incident wave bores. These long-period swash motions may play a significant role in mineral sorting leading to placer formation."
