10,Abstract:,"Marine science is the study of the ocean and its related environments. As the world's population grows, the ocean will become increasingly important to us as a source of raw materials, food, fresh water, a power source, and for recreation. The importance of the ocean to mankind, the influence that the ocean has for the people of coastal states, and the current interest in marine science, has prompted the writing of the 4-H project. This beginning project is written for sixth to eighth graders, but is also suitable for older youth. An advanced project is available for those who have completed this unit. Each unit may be continued for two or more years by developing additional activities. Each Marine Science Club will plan its own program by selecting activities from those listed for this project and by developing other similar activities. Ten or more meetings with at least two trips to the coast will be needed. KW: BEACH SAFETY; PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY; LIFE IN THE OCEAN AND ESTUARIES."
