14,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus causing epizootics among wild and hatchery-reared salmonid fish. The purpose of this study was to develop neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against selected strains of IHNV to determine if these highly specific reagents could be used to differentiate between antigenic variants of IHNV in a manner similar to that reported for rabies virus. It was also of interest to determine if isolates of IHNV fell into different neutralization patterns that would correlate with differences in virulence, host range, or geographic distribution."
