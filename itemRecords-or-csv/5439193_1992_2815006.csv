13,Abstract:,"The use of hormones to accelerate final sexual maturation in salmonids has been highly successful; however, little is known about the effects of these treatments on gamete quality. In this study, eggs were removed from coho salmon at various times after the occurrence of ovulation to determine if extending the time between ovulation and stripping of eggs affected egg viability. Females treated with gonadotropin-​releasing hormone analogue and untreated females were used to assess the effect that holding fish past ovulation had on egg viability."
