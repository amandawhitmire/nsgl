10,Abstract:,"The authors of this study set out to determine whether releasing more hatchery salmon smolts would result in survival of more adult salmon. Applying the Box-Cox flexible functional form to Hokkaido chum salmon and Oregon coho salmon, they found that a maximum number of adults would be reached with increasing smolt release for both species. Thus adult marine survival for these two salmon is density dependent. The authors also found that with increasing Hokkaido chum smolt release, the variability of adult production increases. Results should caution managers that releasing smolts of these salmon species beyond a certain number will not necessarily produce more adult salmon."
