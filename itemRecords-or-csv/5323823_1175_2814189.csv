10,Abstract:,"Oregon 's waterways-the rivers, estuaries, takes. and associated wetlands-are extremely valuable natural and economic resources. They harbor abundant fish, shellfish, and microscopic plants and animals, Waterways area so important for boating, fishing, swimming, and other recreation. Navigable rivers are essential highways of commerce, and industry uses. As we come down and build at the water 's edge, however, conflicts arise. Dredging, filling, bulkheading. bridging, piledriving, and waste disposal are necessary to make economic use of waterways; but these activities usually have adverse impacts on natural aquatic resources. Navigability sometimes threatened by ill-placed development; ownership may be an issue. Protecting navigability, natural resources, and the public interest spells regulation and regulation means paperwork, studies, time, and money. This publication briefly explains how these regulations work, how to apply for permits for waterway development, and how the public decisionmaking process works. It does not cover all the necessary permits for installing dams or hydroelectric facilities. KW: RIVER; LAKE;ESTUARY;DE​VELOPMENT;REGUL​ATION;PERMIT."
