11,Abstract:,"The regional fishery management councils, under which federal U.S. fisheries are managed, have been the subject of criticism for both their structure and their processes. Many fisheries under their management face overfishing, discards, high management costs, and low industry profitability. Two recent national commissions have recommended structural reforms to address these performance problems. I describe these recommendations and question the sufficiency of these reforms to improve management performance. I call attention to the institutional problems that must also be addressed if the structural reforms are to be effective: the absence of property rights in fishery use and the poor incentive structures facing fishery users and managers. Together these would provide the institutional support needed for fishery management to improve performance."
