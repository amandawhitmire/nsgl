12,Abstract:,"This research was conducted to fill a gap in the knowledge of guided fishing charters and companies providing other types of guided recreational experiences along the Oregon coast. This stage of the research examined three services: guided charter salmon fshing, guided whale watching, and guided kayaking tours. Prior to this study, data on the number and type of operators, how well they market themselves online, the services they offer, and the price of services were not readily available. This study presents an inventory of targeted types of guided- tour companies operating on the coast. This research may serve as a foundation upon which future research and needs assessments are conducted to further understand how guided tour operators are reaching their customers and selling their products."
