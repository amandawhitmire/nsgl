11,Abstract:,"This publication brings together research and other sources of information that explore the problems of defining, identifying, and sustaining Oregon's fishing communities. The editor has included profiles of those communities-- Brookings; Gold Beach; Port Orford: Bandon; Charleston, Coos Bay, and North Bend; Winchester Bay; Florence; Newport; Depoe Bay; Pacific City; Garibaldi/Tilla​mook Bay; and the lower Columbia River. Longtime observers of the fishing industry suggest actions that researchers and managers can take to help fishing families and businesses make decisions about the future."
