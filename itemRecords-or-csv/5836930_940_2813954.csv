13,Abstract:,"This guide depicts all fifty species of living marine mammals known from the eastern North Pacific Ocean, which includes the sea otter, sea lions, fur seals, true seals, rorquals, the right whale, the gray whale, sperm whales, beaked whales, dolphins, small-toothed whales, and porpoises. Not only the species but also their behaviors are illustrated; photographs show spy hopping, breaching, and other 'common visible behaviors.' The conciseness, portability, and durability of this four-color waterproof brochure may make it the ideal field tool."
