9,Abstract:,"The purpose of this research was to explore the impact of finfish bycatch on the ocean shrimp Pandalus jordani fishery using two methods. One method looked at the breakage of the shrimp by finfish bycatch in the nets. The other looked at the impact of bycatch on fishing decisions. At-sea research found that finfish bycatch contributes to the breakage of ocean shrimp. However, the impact is small relative to breakage caused by other handling procedures. Bycatch was measured from each net of a double-rigged shrimp vessel, where one side employed a Nordmore grate bycatch reduction device (BRD) and the other served as a control. Shrimp catch was controlled for BRD use and catch day, and sampled throughout processing to evaluate breakage. At greater than 50% bycatch there was a significantly higher percentage of broken shrimp in the control side than in the BRD side for samples taken at the first and third sampling point (p<0.05). After this point the differences became non-​significant. The percent breakage increased from a mean 2.4% broken before placement in the hold to a mean 18.0% broken in the final product. The impact of bycatch on fishing decisions was evaluated by distributing an expanded logbook to volunteer Oregon shrimp vessels in 1998. Logbook questions addressed the reasons and time involved for running to initial fishing grounds, relocating overnight, relocating between tows, dumping tows, and modifying gear. Completed logbooks were collected from 20 vessels representing 263 trips, 1043 fishing days, and 4727 tows. A soft mesh BRD was used at some point by 25% of vessels on 8.7% of trips and 3.3% of tows. Bycatch did not figure prominently in reasons given for choice of initial fishing grounds, relocating between fishing days, or relocating between tows. Bycatch was the main reason cited for dumping tows. In total, 430 (9%) tows were dumped. The estimated weight offish and shrimp dumped equaled 11.3% and 0.3%, respectively, of the landed shrimp catch. Pacific whiting Merluccius productus caused 81.4% of the tows dumped due to bycatch. Opportunity costs attributed to bycatch alone were equivalent to net revenue resulting from 12.3 tows or $3,203 per study vessel. At the fleet level, opportunity costs due to dumped tows totaled 1,227 effort hours, 32.4 trips, or $155,070. This equates to a 4.6% loss in gross ex-vessel revenue."
