22,Abstract:,"The ESTUARY curriculum consists of three major activity areas. Classroom: slide/tape introduction, reading booklet; Laboratory; and Field Trip. It provides a teacher's manual with discussion guides, master worksheets, tests, answer keys, an annotated bibliography, and additional information. A field trip to the South Slough Estuarine Sanctuary is strongly recommended and can be arranged by calling the sanctuary to schedule field trip dates and overnight housing accommodations if needed."
