12,Abstract:,"This study examines the hypothesis that Oregon beach sands are in part relict, the along-coast variations in their compositions having been determined in part by the mixing of sand from the several sources during Late Pleistocene lower stands of sea level, when headlands did not interrupt the mixing. The resulting along-coast pattern of mixed sands could then have been isolated between headlands within the last few thousands years of the Holocene transgression, during which time the overall beach compositions might be modified by more local sources. In order to test this model, a detailed study has been undertaken of the heavy-mineral compositions of Oregon beach sands north of Cape Blanco, and of the potential river and sea-cliff sources."
