14,Abstract:,"This report takes its place among a succession of efforts on the part of U.S. scientists in recent years to reach a nationally integrated program for study of oceanography of the Bering Sea conducive to future cooperative study on an international basis. The workshop held at Salishan Lodge, Oregon, in November 1973 brought together many U. S. participants of the First International Symposium for Bering Sea Study held in Hakodate, Japan, nearly two years ago. Proceedings of the international symposium have been published by the institute of Marine Science, University of Alaska, as Oceanography of the Bering Sea. In the interim, several independent projects have been conducted by separate institutions and agencies in the U. S., paralleling national efforts likewise in Japan and the USSR. Joint international studies have been initiated through cooperative scientific activities between the U. S. arid Japan and the U. S. and USSR. It was the purpose of the workshop described herein to formulate a prospectus for a U. S. program in Bering Sea oceanography. The suggestions in this report are offered as a guideline in the preparation of specific research proposals for most effective response to scientific needs in this area of study."
