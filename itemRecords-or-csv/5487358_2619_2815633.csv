10,Abstract:,"Little is known of the dietary requirements of marine suspension-​feeders, mainly due to difficulties in preparing and delivering microparticulat​e diets to animals living in an aquatic environment. The food particles must be stable in seawater and digestible by the consumer. A laboratory method for preparing cross-linked, protein-walled capsules is described in this study as a means of successfully delivering dietary protein to marine suspension-​feeders such as the oyster ""Crassostrea gigas""."
