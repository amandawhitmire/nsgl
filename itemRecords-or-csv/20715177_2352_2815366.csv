9,Abstract:,"This plan is intended as a first step in a series of actions to upgrade the interpretive experience at the Whale Watching Center in Depot Bay, Oregon. It is intended to provide guidance in the form of a set of recommendations plus design concepts for interpretive, orientation and wayfinding strategies that support the visitor experience on the site and also support the agency's mission. Shawn Rowe from Oregon Sea Grant spent a bit of time consulting with the contractor on this project."
