14,Abstract:,"Salmon availability is highly variable, but the trend in the Pacific northwest has been downward, despite efforts to improve fishing via legislation, treaty, and other policy initiatives. Because of the severe decline in salmon fishing, Washington and Oregon requested help from the federal government, and in 1994 several disaster-relief programs were launched: habitat restoration and data collection jobs in Oregon, and a license buyout in Washington. Are these programs meeting the needs of gillnetters? A survey of 355 licensed gillnetters in Washington and Oregon asked about the effectiveness of disaster relief programs, adjustments made by gillnetters, and their views on the fishery's future. In general, the gillnetters expressed extreme frustration with both the salmon crisis and the disaster relief programs. Gillnetters' recommendations are summarized."
