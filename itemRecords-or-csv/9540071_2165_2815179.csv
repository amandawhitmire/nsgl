16,Abstract:,"Whether it is to evaluate a public investment, or managing the economic security against risks, estimating economic impacts is a crucial process for regional government to make strategic decisions. This study developed a methodological framework to estimate spatially-​explicit industry networks within a jurisdictional region, which provide insights of sector interdependenci​es and leads to an improved economic impact assessment. We applied our framework to estimate the economic impact of a Tsunami event on Clatsop County, Oregon. We first spatially disaggregate the county-level economic network data into two sub-county regions, one of which is spatially aligned with the extent of the potential damage from the Tsunami event. Then, using the derived sub-county regional economic network data, a Multi-regional Input-Output (MRIO) model is built to simulate the both the direct and indirect economic damages to the local economy due to a Tsunami event. Comparing the improved assessment with results from County-level IO model, our method captures the additional interdependenci​es between business service sector inside hazard zone and forestry sector outside of hazard zone within the county, which leads to increased economic impacts after the Tsunami event. In this case study, the information on interdependenci​es between sub-​jurisdictional regions from our model not only improves economic impact estimation, but also helps regional government to identify vulnerable sectors and key economic linkages that affect economic security. Moreover, this spatially-​explicit economic impact assessment framework connects well with the current taxlot-level physical damage estimation by the civil engineers. Together, we built an economic-​engineering impact assessment model to provide a more comprehensive and accurate impact estimation of a Tsunami event."
