13,Abstract:,"In 1995, Oregon began preparing a voluntary plan for restoring Oregon coastal coho salmon runs. The plan encourages a cooperative approach among state agencies, federal officials, and community partners. To learn about the people most affected and most likely to participate in this plan, the authors conducted a survey of 505 coastal residents. Respondents' views suggest support for a voluntary, nonfederal approach to salmon restoration. They show a willingness to pay modestly and to volunteer for salmon restoration, but they lack faith in government's effectiveness. The survey suggests that planning and communications programs will be more successful if they recognize that people's declared values affect how they perceive and receive information about salmon issues more than do any standard demographic variables."
