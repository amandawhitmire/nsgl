13,Abstract:,"The workshop was designed to provide information and, when appropriate, to offer recommendations to institutions in Latin America concerning three areas: - (1) the establishment or improvement of marine extension programs, (2) the development of an undergraduate curriculum in marine resource management, and (3) the development of an undergraduate curriculum in ocean engineering. Consequently, the workshop was divided into three sections: marine extension programs, marine resources and management, and ocean engineering. The session also provided an opportunity for professionals in marine science and engineering to discuss the current and future needs of marine programs in Mexico and other Latin American countries. This report considers some of the basic material covered by the workshop and presents proposed curricula in marine resources administration and ocean engineering.
