13,Abstract:,"The Oregon State University School of Oceanography conducted purse seining surveys of juvenile salmonids in the ocean off Oregon and Washington during spring and summer 1981. The objectives of the field study were: (1) To collect information on the distribution and abundance of juvenile salmonids off Oregon and. Washington; and to relate distributional patterns to oceanographic conditions and forage availability; (2) To make observations on fish movement through recovery of fish marked with coded wire tags and fluorescent pigment; (3) To collect juvenile salmonids for studies of growth, condition and food habits; (4) To assess the composition, abundance, and food habits of nekton co-occurring with juvenile salmonids."
