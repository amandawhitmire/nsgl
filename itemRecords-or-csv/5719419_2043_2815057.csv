15,Abstract:,"The authors examine the significant features of state, federal, and international ocean and coastal law. Each chapter contains one or more problems which are intended to provide a specific context in which to think about the statutes, regulations, and cases. An instructor can organize class discussions around these problems. The nine chapters cover the following subjects: coastal and ocean ecology; private and public interest in coastal lands and waters; protecting water quality and water habitats of the coastal zone; comprehensive management of coastal development; U.S. rights and jurisdiction in the ocean under the international law of the sea; ocean energy and mineral resources; fisheries; marine mammals and endangered species; and pollution."
