11,Abstract:,"Shear stress of Alaska pollock surimi gels, with and without beef plasma protein (BPP), increased as heating rate decreased, but shear strain was unaffected. An increase in shear stress was accompanied by an increase of cross-linked myosin heavy chain. Slow heating rates increased proteolysis in Pacific whiting surimi as shown by degradation of myosin heavy chain and low shear stress and shear strain. Proteolysis of whiting surimi was lessened by BPP to a greater extent as rapid heating rates."
