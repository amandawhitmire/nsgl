12,Abstract:,"""Laminaria sinclairii"" has recently been shown to produce a variety of interesting oxylipins, including several hydroxy acids and three novel divinyl ethers. However, careful scrutiny of several minor fractions obtained during isolation of the above compounds showed one to possess a cyclo-​propyl-​containing oxylipin. Following isolation of this compound by HPLC, spectroscopic analysis showed it to be identical in overall structure and relative and absolute stereochemistry to neohalicholacto​ne, and oxylipin originally isolated from the marine sponge ""Halichondria okadai"" Kadota along with the related metabolite halicholactone."
