10,Abstract:,"The compilation of this extensive data set represents one of the most intensive tagging efforts ever mounted at either public or private Pacific salmon hatcheries. These hatchery experiments, designed to evaluate potential increased production of adult fish, address the following areas: (1) the adequacy of measures used to define the stage of smoltification, (2) the relatively poor contribution of underyearling fish when compared to releases of yearling smolts, (3) the rather considerable variability in survival observed in this and other studies in regard to size and time of release of juveniles, and (4) the need to expand these types of hatchery trials to partition the cause of density-â€‹dependent and size-dependent mortalities into ocean, estuary, and hatchery effects."
