11,Abstract:,"Mariculture, or saltwater ""fish farming,"" has been a part of the Northwest fisheries scene for many years. Recent state legislation has made new Pacific species available to this growing field of commercial enterprise, one that may someday provide us with most of our seafood, This Symposium attempted to examine some of the legal implications of the mariculture trend and focused discussion on the laws, new and old, that affect establishment and operation of mariculture businesses."
