12,Abstract:,"Commonly used food-grade inhibitors, beef plasma protein, egg white, and potato powder were characterized for their inhibitory activity toward proteinases. BPP and egg white had the highest rate of cysteine and serine proteinase inhibition, respectively. Egg white, containing specific serine proteinase inhibitors, reduced trypsin activity by as much as 99%. Active inhibitory components in the proteinase inhibitors were detected by inhibitory activity staining on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-substrate gels."
