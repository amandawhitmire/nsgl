12,Abstract:,"Fifteen shark species make their home off the coast of Oregon during at least some part of each year. And you can get as close to them as you want with this colorful 24 x 36"" poster. Some of those featured: the sixgill shark, with its electric green eyes; the sand-loving Pacific angel shark; the sluggish Pacific sleeper shark, which catches faster prey by ambushing it; the salmon shark, which uses a different technique, running down its favorite prey (salmon, of course) in high-speed chases; the common thresher, which uses its long tail to herd and stun its prey. The watercolor illustrations were done by wildlife illustrator Duane Raver."
