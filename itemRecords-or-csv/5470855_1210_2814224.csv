11,Abstract:,"Despite the fact that archaeological sites on the Oregon and northern California coasts have been sampled for over 100 years, we still know very little about marine mammal hunting as undertaken by prehistoric occupants of this southernmost part of the northwest coast. In this article the author reports on zooarchaeologic​al data recently gathered from the Oregon coast. Review of marine mammal behavior and natural history leads to the inference that late prehistoric strategies for taking those mammals involved relatively simple procurement techniques in the mainland littoral zone."
