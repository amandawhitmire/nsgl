13,Abstract:,"Many fish species and by-products of the seafood industry are underutilized on the West Coast; however, deciding which ones offer realistic economic opportunities is difficult. This workshop comprised a series of panel discussions on assessing realistic profit potential of new products, regulatory pitfalls, domestic and foreign market entry, case studies of previous successes and failures, and engineering and technological problems facing new seafood products. A presentation on maximizing opportunities in underutilized species and by-products ended the day's activities."
