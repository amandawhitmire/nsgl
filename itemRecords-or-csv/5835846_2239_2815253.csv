12,Abstract:,"As recently as twenty years ago, only a handful of experts discussing marine bioinvasions or expressing concern about impacts of non-indigenous species on ocean communities or ecosystems. That situation changed around the world with the appearance in the 1980s of the Eurasian zebra mussel (""Dreissena polymorpha"") in the Great Lakes (U.S. and Canada), the American comb jellyfish (""Mnemiopsis leidyi"") in the Black Sea and Japanese dinoflagellates in southern Australia. The conference on which this volume is based grew from a perceived need by a steering committee to convene a national meeting for those studying marine invasions to share insights into the science of invasion ecology and into managing what is a growing worldwide problem. The volume consists of many of the papers presented at the conference. It covers new and ongoing research, work in progress, current status of management options, and recommendations for new approaches to prevent and better manage biological invasions. Abstracts of poster presentations have also been included. The volume is organized around three major topics: patterns of invasions; ecological and evolutionary consequences; and ballast water management. An additional section on outreach and education highlights the Sea Grant Programs' efforts to inform a broad-based audience. About 50 papers and another 50 abstracts are included."
