10,Abstract:,"By the year 2000 the demographics of the U.S. will have changed dramatically. Our coastal population is expected to double, and to be older than it now is. The number of jobs in the service sector will explode. Single-parent families will incr ease, as will participation of women in the work force. To be successful in the next century, coastal recreational enterprises will need to shift their marketing targets to nontraditional age, gender, and ethnic groups."
