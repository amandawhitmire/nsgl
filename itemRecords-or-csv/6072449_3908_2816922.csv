13,Abstract:,"High pressure processing (HPP) is the only food preservation technology that has reached consumers with a variety of innovative products; ""however, there is still a need for further research to develop tools that the food industry needs to formulate products and optimize processes. Achieving this goal will require knowledge of the mechanism of inactivation of enzymes and microorganisms induced by pressure treatments alone or in combination with other factors such as heat, pH, chemical additives and introduction of a competitive microflora. This article presents a critical review of the most recent efforts."
