12,Abstract:,"A spatial equilibrium approach to analyzing the economic aspects of the Pacific Northwest groundfish products markets provides a better insight into policy-related questions in the post extended fisheries jurisdiction period. Many of the benefits expected to accrue to Pacific coast groundfish fishermen and processors, after the USA extended its jurisdiction over fishery resources to 200 miles, have not been realized. Specifically, the domestic groundfish industry has developed excess capacity in its traditional fisheries while not fully harvesting the sustainable yield of large biomasses of such species as Pacific hake (""Merluccius productus""). There is interest in harvesting policies that reflect marketing considerations. The authors first estimate state, regional and U.S. inventory demand and supply equations. These equations are combined with estimates of transfer costs between states and regions, and storage costs, in a spatial equilibrium model to estimate competitive equilibrium quantities and prices. This model forms the basis for policy simulation and evaluation."
