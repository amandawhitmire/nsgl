12,Abstract:,"Juvenile salmonids display highly variable spatial and temporal patterns of early dispersalthat are influenced by density-​dependentand density-​independentfact​ors.Although juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) movement patterns in streamsand their relationship with body mass and growth have been examined in previousstudies​, most observations were limited to one season or one stream section. In thisstudy, we monitored the movement of juvenile coho salmon throughout their periodof residence in a coastal basin to identify prevalent dispersal strategies and their relationshipswi​th body mass, growth rates and survival. Our results revealed seasonallyand spatially variable movement patterns. Juvenile coho salmon that dispersed to tidallyaffected reaches soon after emergence remained more mobile and expressedlower site fidelity than those individuals that remained in upper riverine reaches. Wedid not detect significantly different growth rates between sedentary and mobile individuals.Alt​hough a greater proportion of sedentary than mobile fish survived winterto emigrate from the creek in the spring, reach of residence at the onset of winter influencedthese survival estimates. Hence, apparent summer-​to-​smoltsurvival for mobileindividua​ls was greater than for sedentary fish in tidally influenced reaches,whereas in riverine reaches the sedentary strategy seemed to be favoured. Our researchidentif​ied complex movement patterns that reflect phenotypic and life historyvariatio​n, and underscores the importance of maintaining diverse freshwater and"
