13,Abstract:,"This study investigated androgen binding in the ovaries of coho salmon to determine if the susceptibility of females to sex inversion could be explained by the transduction of the steroid signal through androgen receptors. It was assumed that if masculinizing steroids act via classical androgen receptors, then characterizatio​n of binding in gonadal tissues would be possible. The gonads of salmonids during the period of sensitivity to androgen-​induced sex inversion are extremely small, making the collection of sufficient tissues for classical binding studies impractical. Therefore, ovaries from juvenile coho salmon (i.e., animals that had already undergone sex differentiation​) were used. Androgen receptors were identified in the cytosol; the characteristics of this androgen binding site are consistent with a model of receptor-​mediated steroid-induced sex inversion."
