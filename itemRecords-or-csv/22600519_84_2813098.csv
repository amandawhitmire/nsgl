14,Abstract:,"Hosted by Oregon Sea Grant, this webinar is for students in grades 6-12 who want to explore careers in marine science. Kristin Beem, who is in OSU's College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, talks about her work providing technical support to scientists at sea. She spends about 120 days a year on research ships fixing the internet, operating sonars, troubleshooting electronics, and deploying oceanographic instruments. Amanda Gladics, a faculty member in the College of Agricultural Sciences  at Oregon State University, talks about her job as a fisheries specialist with Oregon Sea Grant and the OSU Extension Service. She helps Oregon fishermen find local buyers for their catch, and she works with them to prevent whales from becoming entangled in fishing gear. Previously, Amanda conducted research on seabirds. Tracy Crews, who manages Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program, serves as a moderator on this webinar."
