11,Abstract:,"Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, is a valuable North Pacific Ocean species caught in several commercial fisheries and is often discarded due to size or catch limits. Managers must account for the mortality of discarded fish to assess fish populations, yet discard mortality rates of specific fisheries are generally unknown. Delayed mortality is one source of undetected mortality in discarded fish. The observance of delayed mortality in discards during laboratory and field studies suggest that capture stressors may induce physiological modifications that result indirectly in future mortality from stress and/or disease. Since the imposition of a stressor disrupts the capability of a fish to maintain immunological function, understanding the capacity of the immune system to function after an acute bycatch stressor may be important in assessing the survival of discarded fish and further understanding the mechanisms behind delayed mortality. Our main objective was to describe the immunological health of sablefish exposed to capture stressors. First, we reported a number of experiments that evaluated the conditions necessary to maximize a [3H]-thymidine lymphocyte incorporated assay sensitive to B and T cell mitogens. Then, in laboratory experiments designed to simulate the capture process, we subjected sablefish to various stressors that may influence survival: towing in a net, hooking, ecologically relevant temperature of seawater and air, and air exposure time. Following the imposition of stress, the immunological assay was used to assess immune function. The results demonstrated that the proliferative response of leukocytes from stressed sablefish regardless of fishing gear type, exposure to elevated seawater temperatures or air times had significantly diminished responses to the T cell mitogen concanavalin A or the B cell mitogen lipopolysacchar​ide. A significant difference in the immunological response associated with seawater or air temperature was not detected. The duration and severity of the capture stressors applied in our study were harsh enough to induce significantly elevated levels of cortisol and glucose. However, there was no difference in the magnitude of plasma cortisol and glucose among stress treatments. These data suggest that immunological suppression occurs in sablefish subjected to capture-related stressors. The proposal that the immune system is functionally impaired after exposure to capture- related stress presents a potential reason why delayed mortality is possible in discarded sablefish. As a fish is discarded back into the ocean, their ability to perform at the whole organism level may be diminished for an extended period of time and the cumulative strain from maintaining this physiological adaptation can reduce its ability to sustain normal immunological functions. Consequently, this immunological impairment can possibly predispose a discarded fish to disease and eventual death. However, further studies are needed to determine if delayed mortality in sablefish discards can be caused by increased susceptibility to infectious agents resulting from stress-mediated immunosuppressi​on."
