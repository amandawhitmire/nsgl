12,Abstract:,"Pacific whiting meets many of the criteria desirable for surimi production. It is abundant and lean, has low color and flavor profiles and is of low cost. A homogenous meterial, such as surimi, may allow for blending flesh containing elevated protease content with tissue having low protease activity profiles, and the use of protein additives to increase gel strength. The objective of this research was to evaluate the yields and compositional characteristics of surimi prepared from Pacific whiting ""Merluccius productus"" and to determine the effect of time/temperaturâ€‹e relationships and varying concentrations of protein additives on the strength of heat-set gels."
