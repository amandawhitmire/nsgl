11,Abstract:,"Agritourism is defined as any commercial enterprise at a working farm or ranch conducted for the enjoyment of visitors that generates supplemental income for the owner. The USDA estimates that 52,000 U.S. farms, or 2.5 percent of all farms, earn income from agritourism. In 2012, 576 farms in Oregon provided agritourism and recreational services.3 With more than 35,000 farms statewide, there is ample room for growth in this area. Understanding the permits required to establish an agritourism enterprise is a crucial first step toward incorporating this type of activity into your existing operation. The state of Oregon’s land use system provides a framework for regulating agritourism in the state. Because counties have a significant degree of latitude with respect to interpretation and implication of land use regulations, you should contact your local planning department to learn more about the specific requirements that apply to your business. Contact information is provided below."
