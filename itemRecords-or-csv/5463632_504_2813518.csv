24,Abstract:,"The Pacific Regional Conference to address problems and information needs regarding marine pollution of the IJ, S. Pacific coastal states and Hawaiian and Pacific Islands was convened in Port land, Ore., on June 16 through 19, 1980. The conference was one of five national regional conferences which assembled at approximately the same time for the purpose of developing the five-year Federal Plan For Ocean Pollution Research, Development and Monitoring 1981-1985. At the conference, the participants were charged with the accomplishment of four objectives: I. Develop a series of statements identifying significant marine pollution problems in the Pacific Region. 2. Define a set of information needs for each problem area which can be met through ocean pollution research, development and monitoring. 3. Recommend priorities for the sets of information needs. 4. Provide rationale for priorities assigned to the sets of information needs."
