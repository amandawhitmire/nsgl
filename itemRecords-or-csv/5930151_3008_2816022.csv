13,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the biochemical properties and consumer acceptance of fish sauce made from Pacific whiting whole fish and a mixture of its by-products. As fermentation time extended, the degree of hydrolysis, total nitrogen content, amino nitrogen content, and hypoxanthine content increased, while inosine content, moisture content, and pH decreased. All cathepsin activities were negligible after 3 months. Consumer tests showed a nonsignificant difference in overall acceptance between these samples and commercial anchovy fish sauce."
