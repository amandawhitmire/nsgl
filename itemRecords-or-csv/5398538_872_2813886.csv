14,Abstract:,"Forces acting on offshore platforms must be predicted accurately to design safe, economical platforms for severe, deep water environments. Randomness of the sea state should be considered when predicting wave loads on offshore structures. In this study, we predicted the random loads on cylinders, evaluating only cylinders which belong to the Morison equation regime (i.e., cylinders with a diameter-​to-​wave length ratio of 1/5 or smaller). Using a new method to estimate the random wave force, we were able to predict the force spectra and force time series for a given wave profile. Specifically, we addressed three problems: (1) the estimation of force power spectra; (2) the prediction of force time history; and (3) the determination of force coefficients for the frequency domain Morison equation."
