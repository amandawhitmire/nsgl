19,Abstract:,"Seaweed Hub Overview: The Sea Grant network has established a National Seaweed Hub to serve as a science-based, non-advocate resource for the domestic seaweed and seaweed aquaculture industry. This collaboration provides a framework to share information, address challenges, identify needs, and find opportunities in this emerging industry.The first goal is to establish a baseline evaluation on current needs and challenges for all seaweed stakeholders through a formal needs assessment that will inform the creation of work groups to address identified needs and challenges.The second goal is to bring seaweed stakeholders from across the country to work together to find a path forward in addressing challenges, finding solutions to needs, and pursuing opportunities for growth. This will be accomplished through participation in the first National Seaweed Symposium and continue in Virtual Work Groups.Virtual Work Groups will be completely stakeholder-​driven and comprised of a diverse group of dedicated individuals from industry, regulatory authorities, processors, culinary professionals, researchers, and others who have committed to tackling solutions to barriers that currently exist with making domestic seaweed aquaculture commercially viable. Guided by trusted Sea Grant Extension professionals, Work Groups will determine the next steps needed to move the emerging domestic seaweed industry forward. Projec​t AwardA network of 10 Sea Grant programs have been awarded a total of $1.1 million in federal funds to establish a National Sea Grant Seaweed Hub. This collaborative hub will serve as a central clearinghouse for science-based, non-advocacy, practical resources about seaweed aquaculturerese​arch and outreach efforts.The hub will provide a mechanism to share information about seaweed products and cultivation that will enable stakeholders to address challenges, pursue marketing opportunities and make informed decisions. Stakeholders who are invited to participate include current and prospective farmers, regulators, researchers, chefs and developers of non-culinary uses for seaweed.Led by Connecticut Sea Grant, the Seaweed Hub will be managed and facilitated through partnerships and collaborations with the National Sea Grant Law Center, and with Sea Grant programs in Maine, Alaska, Washington, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Woods Hole, MA."
