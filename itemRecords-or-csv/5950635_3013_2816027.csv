18,Abstract:,"This study provides the first evidence that very brief exposures to a low dose of o,p'- dichlorodipheny​ldichloroethyle​ne (DDE) during early life stages can have a long-term effect on the immune function of chinook salmon. Salmon fry were exposed as eggs to the contaminant briefly at fertilization and at hatch. The treatment was sufficient to significantly reduce the humoral response of juvenile fish (1 year later) to a mitogen. The ability of splenic leucocytes to undergo blastogenesis was significantly reduced in fish that showed uptake of DDE during the exposure. The authors report further effects of DDE and the vehicle DMSO on the immune system of salmon."
