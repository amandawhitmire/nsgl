11,Abstract:,"This paper is a limited evaluation of the relative economics of two competitive feeds commonly used in salmon rearing: the Oregon Moist Pellet (OMP) and the Abernathy Dry Diet (ADD). At this point, a word of caution is in order. No attempt will be made here to determine which diet is better. The decision as to which diet is best is strictly entrepreneurial​. Each hatchery and rearing operation is unique. This paper is limited to the examination of some of the economic issues associated with the selection of a particular diet by a hatchery operator. Although this report's assumption of nutritional equivalence is unlikely to be realized, the method of analysis can still be useful. Keywords: Fish, Nutrition."
