16,Abstract:,"Complex environmental issues often become mired in conflict. Collaborative approaches, which include public involvement and learning, can help overcome conflict. To collaborate successfully, groups must surmount the fundamental problems of incomplete and inconsistent information and imperfect understanding of complex human and ecological systems. This review of a proposed riparian ordinance in Tillamook County, Oregon, illustrates the complexity of environmental decision-making and why effective action is so difficult to achieve. It describes how each side of the argument believed the other to base its view on incomplete or inconsistent information, and how to avoid this common occurrence."
