12,Abstract:,"The thrust of this paper or echo today is based on the premise that energy scarcity, whether a crisis or not, is indeed a reality and one that will be constraining much of what our economy and citizens attempt to do in the future. The overall purpose of this talk is to review or increase the awareness of the relationship between energy, transportation, and location of economic activity. This discussion has four principal sectors to it. First, the role and function of transport in the U.S. will be examined with attention paid to the aggregate energy consumed. The second section will examine the differing production functions associated with the alternative transportation modes or different product movements. The third section delves specifically into the interaction of energy constraints, transportation and location of economic activity. The institutional characteristics of transportation will receive at least passing reference. The final section will be a ""back on my heels, eyeball estimate"" of what and how policy issues on transportation and energy will manifest themselves."
