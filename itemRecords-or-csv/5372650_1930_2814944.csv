10,Abstract:,"This forecast begins with a summary of recent trends in ocean fishing practices, goals and methods of fisheries management, and the history of the international law of fisheries management, focusing on the last 25 years. The coming quarter century of international fisheries law is previewed with, and without, the UNCLOS 1982 fisheries rules. The author predicts that UNCLOS will provide little more than an historical benchmark on the way to 2010 and that coastal nations will by then exercise complete sovereignty over fish and fishing activities in their exclusive economic zones. Developments in related, nonlegal fields are briefly noted."
