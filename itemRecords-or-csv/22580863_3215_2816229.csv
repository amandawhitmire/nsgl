11,Abstract:,"Remote setting methods allow the grower to utilize a hatchery without the expense, special abilities or location needed to operate one. In the Pacific Northwest and East coast, for example, large commercial, high-volume oyster hatcheries now produce billions of larvae for sale to growers.  Remote setting of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) was first investigated in 1972 through laboratory studies by D. S. Lund, at Oregon State University (OSU), and commercially by W. W. Budge. Larval handling and remote setting was further refined by West Coast oyster growers and B. A. Henderson, also of OSU. Prior to these efforts, oyster hatcheries were not economically feasible because of cultch (the material on which oyster larvae will set) handling and grow-out problems. Remote setting techniques helped hatcheries become viable by allowing a division of labor between the hatchery operator and the oyster farmer and enabled the hatchery to concentrate on high-volume larval production. Successful commercial remote setting methods have been well documented from the Pacific Northwest and East coast. The information here for this manual was gathered from industry manuals published and distributed in the Pacific Northwest and also generated by research and field demonstrations in Louisiana from 1990-2017."
