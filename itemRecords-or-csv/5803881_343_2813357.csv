12,Abstract:,"Some commercial fishers in Oregon consider selling directly from their boats, trucks, or small roadside stands. When fishers decide to sell their catch directly to the public, they need to obtain a number of licenses and forms from several different state and local agencies and pay the necessary fees. This fact sheet lists the required forms, licenses, and fees, and provides contact information for the relevant agencies."
