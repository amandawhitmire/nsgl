20,Abstract:,"The Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOMEX) project examines the direct and indirect effects of hypoxia on living resources (zooplankton to fish). To assess the spatial and temporal impact of hypoxia on living resources, we applied a multi-scale and multi-stressor approach based on 6 years of spatially-​explicit synoptic data. With the overall goal of providing quantitative tools to probabilistical​ly forecast the effects of hypoxia on living resources, we are employing a battery of modeling approaches of varying complexity (individual - to ecosystem-​level), spatial configuration (near-field plume to fine-scale spatial pelagic to the entire NGOMEX), and temporal duration (hourly to inter-annual). Specifically, we examined: the spatial extent and seasonal timing of hypoxia on fish growth, recruitment, and production potential; hypoxia's effect on pelagic food web interactions in the pelagic zone; and, the most effective tools needed to forecast food-web interactions, habitat suitability, and fish production related to hypoxia. Preliminary results show how hypoxia in the NGOMEX can strongly impact pelagic food webs and production through unexpected, indirect pathways, potentially leading to production changes in economically and ecologically important fishes."
