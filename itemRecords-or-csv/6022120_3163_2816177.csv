9,Abstract:,"Steep bathymetric anomalies in the beach profile, such as offshore borrow pits, submerged breakwaters, and nearshore canyons can significantly transform the wave climate through the effects of refraction, diffraction, and reflection. When located in the nearshore region the modified wave climate can also substantially change the location of breaking and has been observed to impact the shoreline morphology. The current study focuses on the borrow pit case and attempts to explain how limitations in existing methodologies may impact the predictions in both the wave field modification and shoreline response. Recent analytical methods by Bender (2003) have successfully explained the wave transformation near pits. However, these models are only capable of modeling bathymetries of constant depth surrounding the anomaly. Therefore in order to investigate cases without this restriction, this often requires numerical solutions following Berkhoffs (1972) mild-slope equation (MSE). However, a significant limitation of these model types is the accuracy suffers for steep bathymetric features. Booij (1983) demonstrates this for slopes larger than 1:3 (rise:run). Furthermore, these models often rely on Radder's (1979) parabolic approximation to the MSE which restricts the ability to include wave reflection which can be substantial in the case of a borrow pit. These limitations and their effects on shoreline response are investigated in the current study. By utilizing a form of the modified mild-slope equation (MMSE) originally derived by Massel (1993) the limitation of the MSE in representing steep features is removed. Additionally, a numerical model following Lee et al. (1998) is employed to investigate wave transformation around borrow pits of arbitrary depth. The formulation of the model is of hyperbolic form; therefore, the reflected waves generated by a borrow pit are included. The models accuracy is validated through a rigorous set of tests showing that the model compares well with previous analytical solutions for steep features."
