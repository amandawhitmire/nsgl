13,Abstract:,"A rhabdovirus that is serologically different from other fish rhabdoviruses was isolated from chevron snakehead during an outbreak of ulcerative disease in southeast Asia. The snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV) is one of the several potential pathogenic organisms isolated from animals with this disease, but the etiologic agent has not been established. The purpose of this study was to produce monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against SHRV for use in immunodiagnosis​. These MAbs were characterized by immunoprecipita​tion, immunofluoresce​nce, and serum neutralization."
