13,Abstract:,"In fall 2005, the Delaware State Library contracted with the institute for Learning Innovation, an Annapolis-based nonprofit learning research and development organization, to develop a study to explore the motivations, prior experiences, attitudes and expectations of users of the Dover Public Library. The goal of the study was to develop a better understanding of the public's perceptions and use of libraries as lifelong, free-choice learning resources. Building upon previous research, particularly research on the role that identity and visit motivation have on museum learning and behavior, the study utilized multiple methods to investigate the identity-based reasons why people do and do not use libraries regularly and how these identity and motivations impact use of a library in Dover, Delaware. This study was a pilot effort to explore the ability of such an approach to provide a detailed, empirical approach to segmenting library users, using user-centered, identity-based motivational categories rather than library-​centered, activity-​defined categories. The study also helped lay the foundation for better understanding the impact libraries have on lifelong learning and how library services and programs could be designed to better support personalized free-choice learning experiences."
