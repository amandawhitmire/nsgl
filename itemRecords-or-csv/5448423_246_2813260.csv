10,Notes:,"A report presented to the Yaquina Bay Shipping Council June 25, 1975."
11,Abstract:,"The decline in Newport shipping and its attendant problems led to the formation of the Yaquina Bay Shipping Council, a group of public-minded Newport citizens, who want to stimulate deep-water shipping at Newport. The group entered into agreement with the Oregon State University Sea Grant College Program and Department of Economics for a study of deep-water shipping. This report is the first phase of that study, and it provides an overview of the issues surrounding export shipping developments at Newport."
