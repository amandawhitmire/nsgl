13,Abstract:,"A study of fisheries-​related marine career training needs, con ducted on the Oregon Coast in December, 1970, resulted in: 1) specific opportunities for short course and workshops to be conducted by community colleges or extension educators or in combination; 2) ideas for combinations of course work with on-the-job training at both community college and high school levels; and 3) little direct evidence of a need for additional two-year curricular programs. The study, which involved questionnaire contact with 534 Oregon fishermen, marine firms, and educational groups and interviews with about 45 Oregon mariners, covered vocational training requirements, through 1975, of fishermen, seafood processors, charter boat and marina operators, aquaculturists, vessel construction and maintenance firms, and marine supply houses. The study survey was conducted at the request of Southwestern Oregon Community College with support from the Oregon State Department of Education."
