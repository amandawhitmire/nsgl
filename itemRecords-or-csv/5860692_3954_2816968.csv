11,Abstract:,"In Cuba's commercial fishing industry, production emphasis has shifted from high volume, low-value, pelagic stocks toward high-value, nearshore fisheries. Also the management of the nearshore fleet, associated service industries, and the processing sector is being conducted in a more decentralized manner, for example, via the creation of autonomous producer associations. This strategy allows much more control by fleet operators over the various harvesting activities. This paper discusses the recently implemented management structure, and its implications for harvesters, processors, and consumers both in the U.S. and Cuba."
