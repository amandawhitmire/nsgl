8,Abstract:,"Commercial fishing is a life filled with change: changing weather, changing markets, changing regulatory climates, and a changing resource. For many, what's constant are the family, and the spouse who keeps things going while the fisherman is at sea. In this 18-minute video four Oregon fishermen's wives talk about their lives and the roles they play as working partners in their families, their communities, and the businesses on which their livelihoods depend."
