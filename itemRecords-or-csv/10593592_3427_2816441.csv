10,Abstract:,"The fate of salmon in the Pacific Northwest is a perennial concern. This video combines rare color-film footage of the great Indian fishery at Celilo Falls on the Columbia River with public radio reports from 1990-91 about the listing of certain salmon populations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Four radio stories are 1) How the Salmon ESA decision was made, with Merritt Tuttle of NMFS; 2) An interview with Bill Bakke of Oregon Trout, an ESA petitioner; 3) Trying to help migrating salmon at Bonneville Dam, with OSU biologist Alec Maule; and 4) an Indian view of the salmon crisis, with Ted Strong of CRITFC. The silent film footage is courtesy of the Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District."
