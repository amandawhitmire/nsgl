10,Abstract:,"With one of the world's largest ocean Exclusive Economic Zones and extensive archipelagic waters, Indonesia has embraced the Agenda 21 call for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) with a five year national program emphasizing seven themes. Like other major coastal nations, Indonesia faces challenges in achieving sustainability while minimizing conflicting living and non-living resource uses offshore and in coastal areas. This paper reviews short and medium term legal and institutional methods for achieving improved intergovernmentâ€‹al and interagency coordination in Indonesia's implementation of ICZM, with emphasis on improved management of the coral reef, mangrove and other habitats upon which sustainable fisheries depend."
