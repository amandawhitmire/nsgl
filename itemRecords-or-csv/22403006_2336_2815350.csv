12,Abstract:,"This report is for companies along the Oregon coast that provide guided kayaking, salmon fishing and whale-watching tours. It aims to help them better understand the effectiveness of their online marketing and see how their prices compare to those of their competitors. Th​e information in this report comes from a replication of a study that was first conducted in 2017 (bit.ly/2QK6Kof​). The 2018 study uses the same methodology, with some revisions to the data collection process and adaptations to accommodate Google’s changing presentation of search results. The three main goals of the 2017 and 2018 studies were to: • identify businesses that offer kayaking, whale watching, and salmon fishing • document the products and prices offered by these businesses • measure the efficacy of these businesses’ marketing by their presence in Google search results."
