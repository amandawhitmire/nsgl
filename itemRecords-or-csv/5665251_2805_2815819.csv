10,Abstract:,"The catches and profits in a fishery depend on the technology employed, on the utilization of human and capital resources, on the abundance and distribution of the fish stock, and on the prices for fish, fuel, and labor. Here a harvest function is constructed that includes parameters for the main technical components of the fishing process: travel to the fishing grounds, catching fish, and handling those that have been caught. The fishery system does not have the same sensitivity to each technical parameter. Furthermore, small changes in a parameter can result in catastrophic alteration of the system's dynamics. It is argued that fishing technology will tend to evolve more rapidly in those components that have the greatest impact on the flow of fishing profits."
