12,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus that kills salmonid fish, including rainbow trout, chinook, sockeye, and Atlantic salmon. The disease process is associated with massive destruction of hematopoietic tissue in the anterior kidney. In this study, the parental IHNV isolate, RB-76, and four variants selected for resistance to the neutralizing MAb RB/B5 were examined for pathogenicity, antigen distribution, and G gene sequence. A correlation between changes in tissue tropism and specific changes in the virus genome appeared to exist among four IHNV neutralization-​resistant variants (RB-1, RB-2, RB-3, and RB- 4) that had been selected with the glycoprotein (G)-specific monoclonal antibody RB/B5. These variants were compared with the parental strain (RB-76) for their virulence and pathogenicity in rainbow trout after waterborne challenge."
