10,Abstract:,"Exploration and development of seabed mineral and hydrocarbon deposits can raise serious use conflicts, especially where potential conflicts are not dealt with prior to the creation of private rights in the deposits. Marine resource use conflicts arising from development of seabed hydrocarbons and minerals off the U.S. west coast are described and analyzed from a legal perspective. Techniques for avoiding or reducing conflicts include: multiple-use ocean planning to identify potential conflicts; separating exploration and development rights to remove legal impediments to conflict avoidance; using activity schedules, corridors, and buffer zones to avoid conflicts; coordinating federal and state planning and permit processes to reduce conflicts; and providing compensation for unavoidable conflicts."
