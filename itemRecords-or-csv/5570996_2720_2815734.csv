10,Abstract:,"In the Columbia River, the relatively few remaining indigenous, naturally spawning populations of salmon are depressed, and some are threatened with extinction. With few exceptions, salmon fisheries are supported by hatcheries in the Columbia Basin. Regardless of the success of hatcheries, overexploitatio​n of naturally reproducing populations in mixed stock fisheries remains a major biological and political issue. Recent concern over maintaining genetic variability portends a changing role for salmon hatcheries; in instances where natural stocks are severely depleted and possibly headed toward extinction, the goal of hatcheries is likely to shift from enhancement to genetic conservation."
