14,Abstract:,"Marine algae of the genus ""Laurencia"" occur worldwide in diverse marine habitats and are an abundant source of novel natural products. In the course of survey work on the biomedicinal potential of Caribbean seaweeds, the authors initiated a study on the chemistry of the red alga ""Laurencia obtusa."" Crude lipid extracts of ""L. obtusa"" yielded two new brominated sesquiterpenes of the chamigrene type in addition to several known halogenated sesquiterpenes."
