11,Abstract:,"Two cathodic protection techniques are commonly used to control the corrosion of salt water vessels: l! attaching sacrificial metals such as zinc; and (2) using impressed current devices which are driven from the vessel's power supply. The advice of science and industry gained through interviews, a series of seminars, and a collection of literature is summarized in this publication. Recommendations​ on the application of these techniques are made. Several factors can significantly influence the success of these techniques. A few examples are: stray currents from faulty electrical systems on the boat or dock (leading to stray current corrosion), the quality and integrity of the the paint systems, types of metals and materials used, installation practices, hull materials, and water salinity."
