12,Abstract:,"Pacific whiting ""Merluccius productus"" in the Pacific Northwest is primarily used for surimi manufacturing. Conventional surimi processing, which requires extensive washing and dewatering, yields only about 25 percent of whole fish. This study was conducted to better understand biochemical changes of fish muscle proteins as affected by novel surimi process, acid- or alkali-aided solubilization. Objectives were to evaluate the biochemical characteristics of Pacific whiting muscle proteins soluble at various pH conditions and at low and high ionic strength levels, as well as to further investigate the conformational changes and protein patterns."
