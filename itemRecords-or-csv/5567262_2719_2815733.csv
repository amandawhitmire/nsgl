10,Abstract:,"Salmonid fish are susceptible to a wide variety of infectious agents including viruses, bacteria, protozoans and fungi. Seventeen viruses have been isolated from, or are known to occur in, salmonids; more than 25 bacterial pathogens are known. Numerous protozoans affect salmonids, as do some fungi. These infectious agents vary in their virulence, the size and species of host most affected, geographic range, ease of control, and therefore their importance to aquaculture. Important representatives of salmonid diseases have been selected for discussion here."
