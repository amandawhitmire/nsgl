10,Abstract:,"The series of papers presented in this symposium volume addressed four major research themes that fall under the National Oceanic and Administration'​s (NOAA) research mission including: marine resources in the Gulf of Maine, global vent processes, deep-water ecology, and ocean technology/biol​ogical productivity. This volume addresses research on global vent processes and benthic ecology. A companion volume (National Undersea Research Program Research Report 88-3) presents the remaining papers. In many cases, the papers presented herein represent a report to the Office of Undersea Research on preliminary results of funded research and should not preclude publication in peer-reviewed journals. The following papers are in this symposium: (1) Session summary: Global vent processes, by Stephen R. Hammond, pp. 1-2; (2) Gorda Ridge and Mid-Atlantic Ridge: New frontiers for undersea research, by Peter A.
