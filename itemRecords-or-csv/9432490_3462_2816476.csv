13,Abstract:,"This publication reveals and discusses the results of a series of laboratory experiments on the collision phenomena of dual counter-​propagating solitary waves. The experiments were conducted for a variety of collision conditions, including symmetric head-on, asymmetric head-on, symmetric oblique, and asymmetric oblique collisions. The laser-​induced-​fluorescent (LIF) technique was used to capture the water-surface variations in space and time."
