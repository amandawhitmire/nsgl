11,Abstract:,"Some commercial fishermen consider selling directly from their boat, truck, or small roadside stand. Such a decision requires giving careful thought to potential problems: regulations and licenses, as well as transportation, cold storage, price monitoring, packaging sale location, and time away from fishing. This fact sheet lists the required forms, licenses, and fees in Oregon as of 2003."
