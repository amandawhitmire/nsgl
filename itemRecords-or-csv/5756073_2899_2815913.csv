10,Abstract:,"In response to a 1994 decline in the northwest salmon fishery, Congress authorized $24 million for disaster relief. The funds were earmarked for several uses: unemployment insurance, small business loans, habitat restoration jobs, data collection, and purchase of fishing licenses. The fishing population responded to the aid in different ways. Tribal fishers declined to accept relief. Charter boat operators received some loans, but otherwise little assistance. The majority of the funds went to trollers and gillnetters, on whom this study focused. Three- fourths of the people surveyed were dissatisfied with the relief programs. They felt the eligibility requirements were too stringent, the application process too complex, the concept of welfare too demeaning, and the distribution of funds unfair."
