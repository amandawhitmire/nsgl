16,Abstract:,"Previous research has shown that many red algae metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids to oxidized products resembling the eicosanoid hormones from mammals. Some Phaeophyceae and Chlorophyta also possess similar biosynthetic pathways; several have novel prostaglandin-​like substances. Studies of the molecular mechanisms by which some of these marine oxylipins are formed have revealed that novel oxidative reactions are utilized. Understanding of these biosynthetic pathways in detail has allowed their utilization to produce research biochemicals of high value, such as 12S-​hyroperoxyeicos​atetraenoic acid (12S- HPETE). Because of their biological properties, seaweed-derived oxylipins have potential utility as pharmaceuticals and research biochemicals."
