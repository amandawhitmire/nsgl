10,Abstract:,"Fisheries are viewed as organisms that have a life cycle. The typical life cycle begins with an initial emphasis on food production, proceeds to a growing interest in recreation, and finally acquires aesthetic uses. As commercial productivity and the number of commercial and recreational users increase, conservation requires more stringent management measures. Food production opportunities decline and recreation uses expand. Substituting cultured stocks for natural ones increases the quantity of fish available, but usually the life cycle process continues. To adjust to life cycle and evolutionary changes, management needs to separate conservation decisions from allocation issues, include as much of the stock's range as possible, control effort growth, and keep expectations reasonable."
