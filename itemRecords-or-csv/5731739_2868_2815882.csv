10,Abstract:,"Eight different fisheries management council regions have approached management with philosophies and methods which reflect their regional history, culture and economies. In the past decade, all regions have had to adapt to declining availability of historically important species. This paper analyzes the management changes that have accompanied resource decline in the Pacific groundfish fishery. The costs of management increase as the resource becomes more scarce. It is the hypothesis of this paper that management responses to resource scarcity result from attempts to minimize those costs."
