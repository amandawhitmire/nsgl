The publication of this report was sponsored by Louisiana Sea Grant Program,  a part of the National Sea Grant Program maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce. We gratefully acknowledge the many courtesies and skills of Capt. R. E. Adams and the crew of the R/V Oregon II. A special thanks goes to the Southeastern Biology Laboratory, National Marine Fisheries Service, at Pascagoula, Mississippi for enabling us to make this cruise in conjunction with the Ground Fish Survey Project. The computer program  for transposing the raw data onto computer tape is the work of Ms. Mary  White. Survey charts show the temperature, depth, salinity, and density  of the Mississippi Delta Bight."
