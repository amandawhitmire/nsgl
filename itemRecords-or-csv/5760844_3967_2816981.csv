11,Abstract:,"An upwelling zone exhibits both short (hours) and long-term (days) temporal changes in phytoplankton nutrient uptake and community structure in response to the rapid changes in ambient light and nutrient fields occurring during an upwelling event. In the recent literature, two contradictory descriptions of these long-term changes as they relate to phytoplankton nitrogen utilization have emerged. The first, characterized as the 'shift-up' response, hypothesizes that during an upwelling event the phytoplankton assemblage undergoes an acceleration from initially low biomass- specific (V;h-1) rates of nitrogen (NO3-) utilization until a maximal rate is achieved some seveal days after the onset of upwelling. An alternative hypothesis suggest that phytoplankton asssemblages off coastal Oregon are adapted to local conditions even during upwelling events with no evidence for a shift-up response; it suggests that any perceived changes in phytoplankton physiology are artificial in nature, that perceived changes in specific nitrogen uptake rates are a function of biomass and nutrient concentrations, and are not indicative of physiological adaptation. This study provides clear evidence of physiological changes in the natural plankton assemblage of an evolving upwelling ecosystem."
