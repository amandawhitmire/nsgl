11,Abstract:,"Section 8(g) was added to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) in 1978 and amended in 1986. It mandates federal-state sharing of the revenues from OCS tracts within three nautical miles of the federal/state boundary three miles offshore. This paper examines the complex issues which section 8(g), as amended, raises for the management of federal and state submerged lands. Cooperative federal/state approaches to implementing amended section 8(g) are reviewed. Section 8(g)'s broader implications as the only federal/state ocean resource revenue sharing mechanism currently in place are also addressed."
