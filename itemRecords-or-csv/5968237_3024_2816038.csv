12,Abstract:,"Black rockfish ""Sebastes melanops"", like most other rockfish, are long-lived, moderately fecund livebearers with long reproductive life spans. Although their longevity and low rate of natural mortality is presumed to be an adaptation to allow successful reproduction over their lifespan despite long periods between favorable environmental conditions, it also makes them more susceptible to overexploitatioâ€‹n. The objective of the research presented in this paper is twofold. First, the authors describe the basic reproductive life history of black rockfish, with an emphasis on the ovarian developmental cycle and maturity schedule. Second, they investigate age-specific fecundity and temporal patterns in parturition and discuss their effect on reproductive success in a population undergoing truncation of the upper end of its age distribution."
