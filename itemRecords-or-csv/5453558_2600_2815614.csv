11,Abstract:,"The Pacific Northwest Power Planning and Conservation Act, which calls for major institutional innovations, is discussed in the framework of a congressional mandate to preserve and restore the Columbia River Basin's fish runs. Three promises of the Act that the Northwest Power Planning Council has been unable to fulfil concern (1) interim spills for migrating fish to bypass dams; (2) program implementation; and (3) the institutional role of fishery agencies and Indian tribes. The author argues that the Council needs a better understanding of the role Congress assigned to it, and that more of the public, especially those whose livelihood and cultural identity depend on restored Columbia River Basin salmon runs, should be making their views heard to the Council."
