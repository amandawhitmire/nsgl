10,Abstract:,"Ichthyophonus is a fungal pathogen that has been reported to infect a variety of marine and freshwater fishes. It typically causes the formation of characteristic lesions in various internal organs, especially the highly vascular spleen, liver, kidney, and heart. In spite of the wide geographic distribution of Ichthyophonus, no reports of the pathogen from marine fishes of the eastern North Pacific have been published. This report notes the occurrence of Ichthyophonus in a single Pacific staghorn sculpin from Yaquina Bay, Oregon."
