12,Abstract:,"The authors extended the application of a commercial finite-element computer program package, PDEase, to simulate chilling and freezing of albacore tuna. The objectives were to explore the application of PDEase to simulate chilling and freezing of albacore tuna in different chilling and freezing media, to validate models using onboard measurements, and to evaluate the effects of some operational parameters on chilling and freezing rates."
