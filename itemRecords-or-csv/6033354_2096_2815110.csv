9,Abstract:,"Recent examinations of surficial deposits on the Central Oregon Coastal Plain have identified the remnants of a Pleistocene dune sheet (Newport Dune Sheet) that covers the preserved marine terraces. Mapping of the dune sheet (150 ground-truthing sites) shows that the dune deposits mantle more than 90% of the coastal plain. Detailed soil profiles (1-30 m depth) show that the paleodune deposits consist of interbedded dune sand, paleosols (Bg or Bw accumulation horizons), deflation surfaces, and iron-oxide (Ortstein) layers. Two dominant paleosol facies types consist of 1) flat lying, semi-continuous, Bg-accumulation horizons associated with groundwater level deflation surfaces, and 2) curvilinear, discontinuous Bw accumulation horizons associated with stabilized upland dune forms. Investigation of the cement mineralogy using XRD and SEM analytical methods show that the deposits are composed of weakly cemented minerals (vermiculite, gibbsite, allophane, imogolite, and ferrihydrite) resulting from sediment mineral weathering products, loess infiltration, and groundwater precipitation within the paleodune strata. The field and laboratory methods used in this study to characterize the geotechnical and hydrological properties included ground penetrating radar (GPR), pressuremeter, direct shear testing, flexible wall permeability, and triaxial compression testing. The dune facies consisted of clean (<5% fines), fine uniform sand with an average hydraulic conductivity of 1.49xl0^3 cm/s. The paleosol facies consisted of silty (>40% fines) fine sand to sandy silt with a hydraulic conductivity ranging from 6.21xlO4 cm/s to 1.63xl0^6 cm/s. Results from soil strength tests showed that the calculated cohesion values taken from direct shear, triaxial, and PMT testing ranged from 0 to 64.2 kPa and the angle of internal friction taken from direct shear and triaxial testing ranged from 18 to 43 degrees. The measured shear strengths of the paleodune strata are lower than values expected to support observed semi-stable slopes of 50 deg ?70 deg. Laboratory testing underestimated temporary cemented sand shear strength, however, the measured internal angles of friction should provide conservative values for long-term slope stability analysis. The results of the geologic framework and geotechnical characterization will provide a basis to aid engineers, geologists, and developmental planners in appropriate design and effective construction for ""sustainable development"" on the paleodune deposits."
