12,Abstract:,"It has been a relatively recent development in the study of marine-derived natural products to recognize that creatures inhabiting the world's oceans are rich in eicosanoids and related fatty acid derivatives, collectively known as oxylipins. Because metabolites of this class play a crucial role in both mammalian physiology and disease, interest in the structural chemistry, biosynthesis, and pharmacological activities of these marine products has been intense. This review is an attempt to cover comprehensively the available literature to October 1992 on the chemistry, biosynthesis, ecology, and pharmacology of oxylipins from marine invertebrates. Biosynthetic studies of marine oxylipins are providing fundamental new insights into the scope and nature of oxylipin chemistry and metabolism. Study of the ecological and potentially useful pharmacological properties of these unique substances continues to provide new opportunities in medicine and biology."
