13,Abstract:,"At its 17th International Conference held in 2000, the Coastal Society took stock of past successes in coastal and ocean management and looked ahead to challenges of the new century. Four prominent themes of the meeting were (1) Integrating Ocean and Coastal Management, (2) Protecting and Restoring Coastal Ecosystems, (3) Revitalizing Urban Coasts and Waterfronts, and (4) Reducing Vulnerability to Coastal Hazards. Sub-themes included: new technologies in resource management; the concept of 'essential fish habitat'; sustainability in hazard mitigation; creative solutions to perennial problems in ecosystems management; economics in coastal management; the concept of 'marine protected areas'; promoting 'smart growth'; and many more. Over 100 papers are compiled on this CD-ROM."
