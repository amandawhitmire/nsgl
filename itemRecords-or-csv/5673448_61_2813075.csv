12,Abstract:,"During the early spring of 1980 the Sea Grant College Program at Oregon State University was requested to explore the possibilities of establishing an albacore tuna processing facility in Clatsop County, Oregon. This request was primarily initiated by a local subcommittee of the Clatsop County Economic Development Committee and a subcommittee of the Oregon Economic Development Commission examining problems of the lower Columbia River economic development. The author was requested to head such a study effort by the director of the Sea Grant College Program at OSU. Essentially, the study would attempt to assist local and state officials in their decision of whether or not to pursue the re-​establishment of a local tuna processing facility after the closure of a large tuna plant owned and operated by Bumble Bee Seafoods during the winter of 1979 in Astoria."
