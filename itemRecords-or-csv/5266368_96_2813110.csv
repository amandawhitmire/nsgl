14,Abstract:,"The value and productivity of marine artificial reefs as fish havens have been recognized by fishermen and scientists for more than 5O years. Increasing demands on fish stocks by recreational and commercial fisheries as well as the degradation of many natural marine habitats has stimulated interest in artificial reefs. A variety of scrap materials have been used to construct reefs. The Port of Umpqua, Oregon has proposed to construct an artificial reef fabricated from scrap tires at the Z7 fathom contour off the coast. The intended purpose of the reef is to restore recreational bottom f1shing to this coastal area by enhancing habitats for bottom and reef f1shes. This coastal area experiences wave heights wh1ch exceed 30 feet annually. The forces associated with these waves are very large compared to those experienced at other reported reef sites. In order to prov1de a stable yet economical reef des1gn for this site, some basic information relating forces to wave induced water motions is required. This research has been funded by the Port of Umpqua and Sea Grant to 1nvestigate fundamental questions required to minimize construction costs and environmental risks while maximizing reef fishery production. Experimental studies were conducted 1n a large wave channel at the Oregon State University Rave Research Facility to evaluate wave force coefficients and bottom friction coefficients for reef components fabr​icated from tires. The results of the study are not site specific. The experimentally determined force coefficients may be applied to any location where design wave conditions are known."
