12,Abstract:,"This research was concerned with the accurate determination of lift and drag forces on horizontal cylinders from steady and unsteady flow, so that submerged pipelines can be designed with increased confidence. An extensive literature review was made on the hydrodynamic forces on submerged horizontal cylinders from steady flow and from surface waves. In this report the influence of a nearby plane boundary or free water surface, the effects of convective acceleration, and the effects of the modified oscillating flow around a cylinder on lift and drag forces have been considered from the viewpoint of potential f1ow theory and laminar boundary-layer theory."
