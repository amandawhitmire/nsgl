14,Abstract:,"Marine reserves are a type of marine protected area with full protections. This means that taking of marine species within an Oregon Marine Reserve is never allowed. Many studies from around the world show that marine reserves can provide long-term conservation benefits to marine organisms, populations, and biodiversity. In this lesson, students learn about the goals that have been set for Oregon’s Marine Reserves, and how scientific data is being collected to help determine whether the goals are being met. Learning Goals: Students in grades 6-8 will learn the following: • Oregon’s five marine reserves were established to protect marine ecosystems. • Researchers collect data over many years to determine the impacts of marine reserves and whether the goals for the reserves are being met. • Understanding the impacts of marine reserves can inform and improve fishery management decisions. Lear​ning Objectives: Students will be able to: 1. Describe the mission of Oregon’s five marine reserves, 2. Obtain, evaluate and communicate information about marine reserves from scientific texts, 3. Analyze species and habitat data collected from inside and outside of marine reserve areas."
