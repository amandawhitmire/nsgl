12,Abstract:,"For a number of reasons, icing of fish still represents the best way to chill, preserve, and land the highest quality product. Ice chills fish rapidly and is readily relocated; meltwater aids sanitation. Initial capital costs are low and operating costs can be relatively low, also. However, ice may be difficult to acquire and proper distribution on board requires a combination of work and experience. Also, in some vessels bulk loading in ice can crush fish near the bottom of the bin. The forms in which ice can be acquired are noted, along with the main jobs ice performs (chilling and aerating the catch, cooling the hold). On-board refrigeration systems using ice are described."
