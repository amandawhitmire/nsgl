13,Abstract:,"Invasions of aquatic habitats by non-indigenous species (NIS), including zooplankton, are occurring at an alarming rate and are causing global concern. Although hundreds of such invasions have now been documented, surprisingly little is known about the basic biology and ecology of these invaders in their new habitats. Here the authors provide an overview of the published literature on NIS zooplankton, separated by life history (holoplankton vs. meroplankton), habitat (marine, estuarine, freshwater), and biological level of organization or topic (e.g. distribution and range extension, physiology, behavior, feeding, community impacts, ecosystem dynamics, etc.). Amongst the many findings generated by their literature search, perhaps the most striking is the paucity of studies on community and ecosystem level impacts of NIS zooplankton, especially in marine and estuarine systems. They also present some results from two ongoing studies of invasive zooplankton in the northeast Pacific Ocean -- ""Pseudodiaptomu​s inopinus"" in Washington and Oregon coastal estuaries, and ""Tortanus dextrilobatus"" in San Francisco Bay. Both of these Asian copepods have recently expanded their range and can at times be extremely abundant (10^3m^- 3). The authors also examine some aspects of the trophic (predator-prey) ecology of these two invasive copepods, and find that they are likely to be important in the flow of material and energy in the systems in which they now pervade, although their impacts at the ecosystem level remain to be quantified. Finally, the findings of both their literature search and their two case studies of invasive zooplankton led them to make several recommendations for future research."
