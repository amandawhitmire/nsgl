12,Abstract:,"This online report was prepared for albacore fishermen and processors to support planning, design, and operation that will lead to improved quality of albacore tuna. The report provides information on how rapidly albacore can be chilled and frozen on board under a range of conditions. Many of the reported results are predictions based on a computerized model that relies on temperature measurements made during several trips over the course of three seasons. Factors addressed include fish size, ambient air temperature, tank water temperature, and the sizing of chilled seawater/slush ice tanks and refrigerated seawater tanks."
