12,Abstract:,"A condominium was built in 1982 on an Oregon bluff called Jump-Off Joe. Development had the approval and support of the city government, and registered geologists and engineers had determined that the site was stable even though it is adjacent to an active landslide and in an area where the coastal rate of erosion is greatest. Within three years slope retreat had caused foundation failure and the unfinished structure had to be destroyed. The developers, the contractor, a lumber company, and an insurance company were bankrupt; the largest creditors received 1-18 cents on the dollar. An environmental group fighting the project spent nearly $10,000. A geologist lost his certification. The debate over Jump-Off Joe was the most divisive land-use battle ever fought on the Oregon coast. It was a classic confrontation between developers who thought their project would help a city grow, and environmentalisâ€‹ts who wanted to preserve the coastline; in the end, the issues were decided by Nature. The story is summarized here."
