12,Abstract:,"Banks lend money. Fishermen often find it necessary to borrow money. Yet there seems to be a frequent failure of coordination and communication be tween the two groups. This article will attempt to bridge this ""communication gap"" by providing fishermen with knowledge, from a survey of some lending institutions, of what it is that a loan officer looks for in evaluating a fisherman's loan proposal. Of course, this is not to say that even armed with this knowledge a fisherman will be able to transform an economically unsound proposal into a sound one. It is clear, however, that if he prepares adequately be fore his initial contact with a lending institution, then the fisherman has greatly improved his chances of obtaining a loan. Getting a loan is somewhat of a sales problem and the product to be sold is the fisherman's ability to repay the money at reasonable terms. Therefore, this bulletin may be thought of as a ""sales tool"" for the would-be borrower. It offers tips on preparing a proposal to increase the chances of acceptance. It points out some pitfalls a fisherman might try to avoid in negotiating a loan. It attempts to solve one of the fishing industry's toughest problems—financ​ing."
