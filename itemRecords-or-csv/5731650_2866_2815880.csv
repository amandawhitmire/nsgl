12,Abstract:,"This paper analyzes international trade in value-added products when free trade and perfect competition for an intermediate products (such as raw fish) is not operating. Current evidence from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade regarding disputes between countries, such as the U.S.-Canada dispute over trade in raw herring, suggests that bilateral trade in raw fish among major exporters may not be completely free of structural and political barriers. The analysis illustrates how, under such conditions, economic forces contribute to the creation of trade disputes."
