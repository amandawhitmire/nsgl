12,Abstract:,"In 1991, the National Marine Fisheries Service and, on a broader scale, the participating nations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), placed multilateral restrictions on the harvest of swordfish from North Atlantic stocks. These restrictions were necessary to reduce fishing mortality on what were deemed to be overfished stocks. A multi-market approach is used to estimate consumer welfare changes in swordfish and tuna markets as both markets adjust to changes in swordfish management. The results of this analysis are compared and contrasted with that of a partial equilibrium approach in which market prices of substitute species are held constant. The study findings indicate that the partial equilibrium approach ignores the price effects of market interactions and results in incomplete analysis of fishery management policy."
