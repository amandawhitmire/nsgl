12,,"The hydrodynamic forces on a horizontal cylinder, either immersed or towed in waves, are determined experimentally for Reynolds number up to 500,000. The differences of the wave force coefficients between a horizontal cylinder in waves and in planar oscillatory flow are shown and the effects of a current on the force coefficients are examined. The hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder towed in a wave field can be simulated if the linear superposition principle is assumed."
