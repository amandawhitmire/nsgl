10,Abstract:,"Societies depend on water. They also depend on knowledge, science and experiences to anticipate responses from water management. Increasingly, through institutional requirements for broader impacts and/or the desire for improving societal relevance, academic researchers collaborate beyond their disciplines to comprehensively answer water management questions. The NSF-funded “Climate Change and Water Sustainability - Willamette Water 2100” (WW2100) project brings together scientists from twelve disciplines in a co-learning realm with a diverse array of water users and managers to develop a transdisciplina​ry model and define future scenarios within that model in order to anticipate future water scarcity. Scientific and lay-knowledge and questions have been incorporated into the model as a result of this five year-long collaboration. Through semi-structured interview, this research takes a grounded-theory approach to understand the social dynamics on an interdisciplina​ry project such as this. The results lend a voice to the researcher and stakeholder participants as they define their expectations for and results of the project and how it has impacted them personally and professionally. While this study focuses on participants in Oregon’s Willamette River Basin, the lessons learned from this project can inform future interdisciplina​ry researcher - stakeholder engagement efforts to research water or any other shared natural resource."
