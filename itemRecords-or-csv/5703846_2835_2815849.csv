11,Abstract:,"Multiple approaches to control viral infections in fish are being experimentally employed. They include techniques to monitor fish populations for viruses by tissue culture infectivity, tagged antibody reagents to detect viral proteins, and nucleic acid probes for ""in situ"" hybridization or polymerase chain reaction amplification. In addition, scientists are developing prophylactic treatments in the form of traditional vaccines and subunit, peptide and genetic vaccines using molecular biological techniques. The success of all these approaches is obviously dependent on an understanding not only of the molecular structure of the virus and its genome but on the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to disease in the host animal as well. It is at this level that the formulation of appropriate control strategies has been difficult. For example, molecular techniques have provided evidence that the survivors of infection with infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus are long-term carriers of the virus. This finding raises questions regarding the policy of releasing anadromous fish that have survived the disease. Is there a vaccine formulation that will prevent carrier formation? This, and related questions are discussed in this review."
