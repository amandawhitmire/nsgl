15,Abstract:,"A laboratory benchmark test for tsunami inundation through an urban waterfront including free surface elevation, velocity, and specific momentum flux is presented and compared with a numerical model (COULWAVE). The physical model was a 1:50 scale idealization of the town Seaside, Oregon, designed to observe the complex tsunami flow around the macro-roughness such as buildings idealized as impermeable, rectangular blocks. Free surface elevation and velocity time series were measured and analyzed at 31 points along 4 transects. Optical measurements of the leading bore front were used in conjunction with the in-situ velocity and free surface measurements to estimate the time-dependent specific momentum flux at each location. The maximum free surface elevation and specific momentum flux sharply decreased from the shoreline to the landward measurement locations, while the cross-shore velocity slowly decreased linearly. The experimental results show that the maximum specific momentum flux is overestimated by 60 to 260%, if it is calculated using the each maximum values of the free surface elevation and cross-shore velocity. Comparisons show that the numerical model is in good agreement with the physical model at most locations when tuned to a friction factor of 0.005. When the friction factor decreased by a factor of 10 (from 0.01 to 0.001), the average maximum free surface elevation increased 15%, and the average cross-shore velocity and specific momentum flux increased 95 and 208%, respectively. This highlights the importance of comparing velocity in the validation and verification process of numerical models of tsunami inundation."
