9,Abstract:,"Macroalgae (seaweeds) are the basis of a major global industry. Oregon, however, does not allow the commercial harvest of its seaweeds. This study looked at within- and between-year recoveries of five species of macroalgae following harvest. Three experiments compared seasonal harvests, removal methods, and removal amounts. Only Alaria marginata Postels et Ruprect regained pre-harvest lengths within one year. However, recovery was evident in all five species one year after treatments. These results suggest the possible sustainable harvest of Oregon's algal resources. Additionally, the diatom community epiphytic on Mastocarpus papillatus (C. Agardh) Kutzing was chronicled between May and September 2002. Diversity peaked in May when abundance was lowest and reached a low in July when abundance was highest. Cocconeis scuttelum Ehrenberg was the most common epiphytic taxon. Characterizing the epiphytic community provides an additional metric for assessing macroalgal recovery."
