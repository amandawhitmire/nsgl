15,Abstract:,"In recent years, an increasing number of large whales have become entangled by crab trap lines off the U.S. Pacific coast. Wildlife managers are interested in knowing whether the whales are from threatened or endangered populations. In this lesson, students will learn how whale populations are defined, and how population genetics can be used to help inform marine policy and management. Lea​rning Goals: Students in grades 9-12 will learn the following: • Genetic data provides information that can help researchers and resource managers identify and protect populations that are at greatest risk. • Genetically distinct populations of organisms can exist in the same area during certain periods of the year. • Knowing the status of the population to which an impacted individual whale belongs can inform how managers respond to threats. Learning Objectives: Students will be able to: 1. Characterize the humpback whale populations that visit the U.S. Pacific Coast, including life history events, population status, and threats. 2. Analyze genetic evidence to determine the population to which an individual belongs. 3. Use genetic evidence to inform policy proposals that could protect whale populations that are most at risk."
