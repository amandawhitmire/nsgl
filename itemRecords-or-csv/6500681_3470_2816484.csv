19,Abstract:,"In a wonderful blend of art and science, nationally syndicated Stone Soup creator Jan Eliot depicts her character Alix, a young girl and ""budding"" scientist, innocently releasing an invasive crayfish into the wild. The comic strip series recently featured in a Science News article discusses the consequences of releasing nonnative organisms on the fragile balance between organisms in the environment."
