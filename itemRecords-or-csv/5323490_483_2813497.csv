14,Abstract:,"Seventeen cultures of Yersinia ruckeri isolated from diseased salmonid fish in Oregon and Idaho, U.S.A. and Saskatchewan, Canada, were studied by serological and immunological methods. Based on agglutination reactions, four were found to have an antigenic composition distinctly different from that of the other thirteen. Thus the existence of two serotypes, referred to as I and II, was demonstrated. The group which included the Idaho strain (H1-70) was designated serotype I. Cultures of serotype I also differed from those of serotype II with respect to the fermentation of sorbitol. A bacterin prepared from a formalin killed culture of serotype II given intraperitoneal​ly to juvenile rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) protected them against infection with cultures of either serotype I or I I. Bacterin made from a culture of serotype I, however, provided protection against serotype infection, but not against serotype II. Bivalent bacterin (serotype I and II) effectively protected fish against infection with either serotype."
