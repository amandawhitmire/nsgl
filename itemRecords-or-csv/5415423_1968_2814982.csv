10,Abstract:,"Anadromous fish provide a fruitful area for legal study because of their environmental sensitivity, their immense migrations, their economic value, and their role in a long history of bitter allocation struggles. A course in Pacific salmon law offers an opportunity to examine diverse legal principles-​-​ranging from judicial interpretation of century-old Indian treaties to administrative implementation of recent federal laws and international treaties-​-​affecting efforts to preserve, restore, and fairly allocate the resource. Thus, students are exposed to real property concepts, federal environmental legislation, administrative procedure, interstate disputes, and international law and custom--topics seldom explored in a single law school course. In addition, the course involves interdisciplina​ry issues, such as how decision makers should be affected by cost-benefit analysis, scientific uncertainty, and biological concerns like genetic diversity."
