13,Abstract:,"Few studies have investigated the effect of n-3 fatty acids obtained solely from a practical amount of dietary fish consumed under carefully controlled dietary conditions; none have studied the effect of different species of fish. Here, a feeding study was conducted in humans under rigidly controlled dietary conditions in normotriglyceri​demic male subjects. The objective of this study was to examine the effect on serum lipids and apolipoprotiens of the consumption of Dover sole (""Microstomus pacificus""), which is low in n-3 fatty acids, and of Chinook salmon (""Oncorhynchus tshawytscha"") and sablefish (""Anoplopoma fimbria""), which are relatively high in n-3 fatty acids, when these fish were used as the primary source of dietary protein in a typical Western diet."
