10,Abstract:,"Corroded hardware like fittings, bolts, plates, and wires is a fact of life in any area near the sea. It is extremely common on boats and fishing gear. People often assume that a simple, though not always inexpensive, solution exists: make it out of stainless steel. But under certain conditions, you might discover that after a short period of time, the piece of stainless steel has corroded and fallen apart, anyway. This fact sheet goes into more detail on how corrosion can occur in cracks and crevices where seawater is essentially stagnant. It is called crevice corrosion."
