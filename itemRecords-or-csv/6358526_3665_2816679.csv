9,Abstract:,"Immersion suits, also called survival suits, have helped saved hundreds of lives, largely because they provide protection from hypothermia. However, the protection of a survival suit is only good if you have it on and during at-sea emergencies, you may only have seconds to do this. This video walks you through the proper techniques for donning immersion suits and entering the water."
