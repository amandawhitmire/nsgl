12,Abstract:,"Micro- and ultafiltration were utilized for recovery of proteins and for water recycling from commercial surimi processing waste water. The proteins recovered by microfiltration showed highly functional properties and composition comparable with proteins in regular surimi. Surimi with a substitution (10%) of recovered proteins did not diminish in gel hardness, elasticity, color, or water retention. Aerobic plate count, chemical oxygen demand, protease activity, and turbidity in the surimi waste waters were reduced by ultrafiltraton. Results indicated a potential for recovering proteins to extend yield and recycling water."
