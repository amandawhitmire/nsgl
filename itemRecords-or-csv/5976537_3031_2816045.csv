11,Abstract:,"The enumeration of fecal indicators is the cornerstone of testing for fecal pollution in recreational, potable, and shellfish water. There is currently no single bacterial indicator used in all water systems. Here microbiologists report a quantitative ""Taq"" nuclease assay for general fecal pollution using a ""Bacteroidetes"" 16S rDNA marker. The assay is compared to the Colilert-18 system for accuracy, range, and limits of quantification in serial dilutions of primary sewage influent."
