11,Abstract:,"After site planning has been completed, a thorough design process, usually culminating in a set of drawings and specifications and a stormwater report, is needed to ensure that proposed low impact development practices function optimally according to the client’s desired outcomes (i.e., remove pollutants, relieve flooding, provide habitat). This fact sheet points out some key hydraulic and hydrologic considerations for the design phase that apply generally to the project."
