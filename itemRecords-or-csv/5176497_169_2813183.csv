14,Abstract:,"On February 6-7, 1975, the Pacific Sea Grant Advisory Program (PASGAP) sponsored a fishery cooperative symposium. participants included commercial fishermen, members and managers of coops, attorneys, accountants, and representatives from government agencies and state extension programs. The objective was to provide practical information on organizing and operating a fishermen's cooperative. The symposium focused on the experiences of people already involved in cooperatives and on questions from other participants who had come to learn more about coops. This publication is a results of the symposium. It incorporates panel members' presentations, participants' questions, and discussions of the group as a whole; but it is not simply a transcript of the proceedings. The publication contains information on services available to coops; practical guidelines on cooperative management, plant operations, and marketing; and also some first-hand reports on coops already established in the Northwest."
