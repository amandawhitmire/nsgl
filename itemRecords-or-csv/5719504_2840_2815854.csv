10,Abstract:,"This paper evaluates the contribution of user participation to fishery management in the Pacific U.S. as measured by four performance indicators: equity, stewardship, resilience, and efficiency. The paper discusses the four performance measures, then examines user participation in three cases of groundfish management within the Pacific Fishery Management Council. The effect of user participation on management performance is evaluated in each case, illustrating the conditions under which user participation can both promote and work against equity, sustainability, resilience and efficiency."
