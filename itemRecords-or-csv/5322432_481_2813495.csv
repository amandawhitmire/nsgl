15,Abstract:,"Such is the pace of federal fisheries law that the original edition of the Guidebook was outdated even as it was being published. This revised edition incorporates the 1983 amendments to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, together with regulations in effect as of mid-1984. Its loose-leaf format will permit convenient and inexpensive updating of Guidebook material. The scope of the revised edition has been expanded somewhat to include recent developments in federal law that are peripheral yet possibly of great importance to future implementation of the FCMA. Most importantly, these include the interlock between the FCMA and the Coastal Zone Management Act, how each of these Acts bears upon CZMA ""federal consistency"" provisions, and also the possible effect on the FCMA of the Supreme Court's ruling on the unconstitutiona​lity of the ""legislative veto."" Another new feature of this edition is its ""pan-​Pacific"" emphasis, with coverage expanded to include fisheries in the vast portion of the Pacific governed by the Western Pacific Fishery Management Councils Also new is a table of operational or proposed fishery management plans for the jurisdictional areas of the three Pacific Councils. The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act of l976  FCMA! has turned out to be one of the most controversial and confusing pieces of federal legislation in recent memory. The controversy is inevitable, but in this Guidebook we try to do something about the confusion. We hope that this book will communicate effectively to a broad range of readers, but especially to those who are most affected by the workings of the bureaucratic machine created by the provisions of the FCMA."
