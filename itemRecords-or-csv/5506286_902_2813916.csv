11,Abstract:,"Fishing nets have been used for thousands of years by those who seek food from the sea or to make their living by catching fish. The introduction of net making machines about 100 years ago speeded up operations considerably and meant much bigger nets could be manufactured. However, many hours still had to be spent by fishermen washing the natural fibres, preserving them with tar or tannin and mending them to extend their useful life. When synthetic fibres were introduced in the 1950s, nets of greater strength and longer life became available to fishermen; despite these advantages modern nets still get damaged and have to be repaired by hand. Originally published as a guide to mending and patching nets aboard Australian fishing boats, this publication offers diagrams and descriptions of net knot types, mending, and patching."
