10,Abstract:,"As suitable building sites become scarce, the pressure to develop in natural hazard areas increases. Many citizens are not aware of the potential dangers which exist in hazard-prone areas. In response to this lack of awareness, the following information has been compiled to aid property owners, sellers, and buyers learn about natural hazards along the Pacific Northwest coast. The following summary of information will briefly describe common natural hazards and discuss their significance in relation to various land types found along the coast; provide some guidelines for identifying possible hazard areas and indicate some special precautions which may be necessary in such areas; and list sources of additional information for those seeking answers to specific questions or problems."
