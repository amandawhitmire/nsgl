12,Abstract:,"When a family member is either the owner of a fishing boat or a member of the crew, there is always the risk of injury or death, or the loss of the vessel at sea. This publication is intended to help you gather, and provide a record of, essential information about you, your family, and vessel. In case of an emergency the information would help survivors deal with post-casualty demands and concerns."
