13,Abstract:,"Fishery management conflicts increase as decisions evolve through three stages: conservation, regulation, and allocation. The major sources of conflict in fishery management are increases in the size and effectiveness of user populations, stabilization or decline in the resource base, cultural differences between users, and different goal orientations of users. Four case studies of Pacific U.S. fishery conflicts are presented along with the processes used to resolve them. From the case study examples, two approaches to the resolution of conflict, authoritative and participatory, are generalized. The future direction of fishery conflicts is projected to be the expansion of fishery-â€‹specific conflicts into more general resource system conflicts."
