12,Abstract:,"This work continues the authors' bioprocess engineering analysis of ""Agardhiella"" microplantlet cultivation. They report that their stirred tank bioreactor is a suitable configuration for long-term cultivation of ""Agardhiella"" microplantlets. However, biomass production at high plantlet density can be limited by the carbon dioxide input associated with the aeration gas."
