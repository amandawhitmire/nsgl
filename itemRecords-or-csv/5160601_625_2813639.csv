11,Abstract:,"Anyone taking a trip at sea or walking on the beach notices that nearshore water along coasts is frequently green or brown and sometimes even red. Often these colors signify the presence of mud or silt carried into the sea by rivers or stirred up from the bottom if the water is sufficiently shallow. However, a murky green or amber appearance is almost always due to the presence of many small, single-celled plants called phytoplankton, or ""plant wanderers."" These plants contain green pigment, chlorophyll, by which they carry out photosynthesis,​ using light energy. They also contain other ""accessory"" pigments which are used either to trap sunlight or to protect the chlorophyll from too much sunlight."
