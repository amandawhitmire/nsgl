11,Abstract:,"Touch pools have been proven as one of the most popular and memorable exhibits in aquariums, and with their popularity, touch pools seem to be a great teaching tool for marine science. Parents in a free choice learning setting such as touch pools often serve as facilitators who serve as a ""bridge"" which connects the gaps between their children's ability to understand the content and the knowledge behind the exhibits. Language, as a physical and psychological tool, affects the engagement of learners by creating different socioculturally meaningful types of interaction within which learning occurs. In our study, we compared the visiting experiences between the regular U.S. and Taiwanese visiting families using questionnaires, discourse analysis of video recorded behaviors and in depth interviews at Hatfield Marine Science Center in Oregon, USA. For this study, we focused on the interactions between parents and children through dialogue and the role of parents as facilitators in their children's learning. We documented the differences of interactions between non-native (Taiwanese) and native English speaking families in an English-based free choice learning setting and the socio-cultural meanings of visiting children's learning experiences. Our findings on the roles of languages and cultural backgrounds play in the families' visiting and learning help us better understand the visiting experience of our visitors and might be applied to exhibit design and the implementation of learning events in order to facilitate science learning in free choice settings and enhance the public's scientific literacy in general and marine science literacy in particular."
