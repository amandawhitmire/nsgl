9,Abstract:,"Fish ball is an extruded surimi-based product that is popular among Asian communities. In the manufacturing offish ball, optimum floatation is extremely important for maximal production. Factors affecting floatation offish ball in water were investigated. The density of threadfin bream surimi significantly decreased (P<0.05) as moisture content increased from 80% to 84% and surimi paste temperature increased from 5 deg C to 40 deg C, to 90 deg C. Increased salt concentration from 2% to 3% also decreased surimi density. The ability of surimi to float or sink in water was observed according to changes in density. In gel texture measurement, when surimi was thawed for 1 h before chopping at 5 deg C with 2% salt, the highest breaking force and deformation values were obtained. When surimi was thawed for 4 h before chopping at 20 deg C with 3% salt, the lowest breaking force and deformation values were found. Apparent viscosity of surimi decreased as moisture content increased from 80% to 84%, salt concentration increased from 2% to 3%, and chopping temperature decreased from 20 deg C to 5 deg C. Setting surimi in salt solution (5 or 10%) significantly reduced (P<0.05) stickiness of surimi, which is the tendency of surimi to stick to one another. Fresh fish ball is an extruded surimi-based product that is packaged after setting. Oversetting of fresh fish ball occurs at chilled temperature during storage. Shelf life extension of fresh fish ball by reducing oversetting conditions and microbial counts were examined. Encapsulated citric acid (CT) and Glucono-​Delta-​Lactone (GDL) were used to reduce oversetting. Parameters such as color, texture properties, pH, non-disulfide covalent bond, TGase activity, microbiological assay, viscosity, and water retention ability were examined to measure changes of fresh fish ball during refrigerated storage. Acetic acid, GDL, and chitosan were used to inhibit growth of microorganisms. Shelf life was measured for a period of 21 days. At Day 21, a reduction of 46%, 56%, and 26% in breaking force compared to the control was observed for 0.5GDL, 1.0GDL, and CT, respectively. GDL at 1.0% was shown to be the most effective in controlling oversetting of surimi. Chitosan (1%) dissolved in acetic acid maintained both total aerobic plate and yeast counts as <1 log CFU/g throughout the 21 days of storage."
