12,Abstract:,"In order to identify genes in fish that respond to virus infection or interferon induction, microbiologist began a study using suppressive subtraction hybridization to construct cDNA libraries enriched for interferon-​inducible genes. Subtraction hybridization libraries were constructed with cDNA obtained from the kidney, spleen, and liver of Chinook salmon (""Oncorhynchus tshawytscha"") and staghorn sculpin (""Hemilepidotus spinosus"") before and after injection with poly-IC, a potent interferon inducer. This method identified genes very similar to those described as interferon-​inducible genes in mammals."
