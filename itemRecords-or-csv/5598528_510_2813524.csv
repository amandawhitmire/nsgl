13,Abstract:,"The Kumamoto oyster ""Crassostrea sikamea"" is a distinct biological species. Confusion over the specific status of the Kumamoto oyster has contributed to contamination of commercial brood stocks on the west coast of the U.S. The long-term persistence of this species in the west coast oyster industry is threatened by hybridization with Pacific oysters and by the fact that an inadequate number of individuals effectively propagates. The west coast oyster industry should take immediate steps to preserve the genetic integrity and diversity of its Kumamoto oyster brood stocks. Researchers met at a 1992 workshop, reported on here, to achieve a better understanding of the Kumamoto brood stock situation and to devise a strategy for ensuring a reliable source of high-quality Kumamoto oysters."
