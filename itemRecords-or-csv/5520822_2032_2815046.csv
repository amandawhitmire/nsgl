10,Abstract:,"The hypothesis that the estuarine phase of the early life history of chum salmon is critical needs to be tested. If this phase is essential, increased releases of hatchery fish from private or public hatcheries may not be beneficial unless release strategies minimize or circumvent density-â€‹dependent growth and survival in estuaries, e.g., by modifying size, time, or numbers of fish released. The downstream movement, distribution, abundance, residence time, growth, and production of chum salmon in Netarts Bay, Oregon, were studied. Based on recaptures of fin-clipped hatchery fish, the residence of juveniles varied inversely with size of fish at release. Large (6.5 g) fish immediately emigrated from the estuary and 3-4 times as many returned as adult fish than did smaller (1.0 and 2.2) g juveniles, which had residence half-lives of 5-16 days."
