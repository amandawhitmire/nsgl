16,Abstract:,"Members of the family Birnaviridae possess a bisegmented double-stranded RNA genome consisting of two segments within an unenveloped, single-shelled icosahedral capsid. Members include infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), the causative agent of an acute, contagious disease of young salmonid fishes. The sequence of the viral A segment has been determined for two IPNV Jasper strains. Here, the genome segment B sequence of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus was determined for both the Jasper and Sp serotypes. The sequences are 2784 and 2630 bp long, respectively, and contain a single large open reading frame encoding the VP1 protein, the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of IPNV. Unlike the RdRp associated with single-stranded plus RNA viruses, the birnavirus RdRP lacks the Gly-Asp-Asp motif characteristic of this enzyme family."
