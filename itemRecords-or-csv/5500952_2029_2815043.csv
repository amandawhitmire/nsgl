10,Abstract:,"Health management in aquaculture depends on maintaining optimal environmental conditions, enhanced resistance, and control of pathogens. Maintaining adequate water quality and quantity are integral parts of fish culture, necessary not only for infectious disease control, but for survival and growth. Control of pathogens is accomplished several ways, the most effective being avoidance of the pathogen. Other control methods include management techniques which decrease opportunities for disease transmission, prophylactic administration of antibiotics or vaccines, and therapy with drugs and chemicals. These methods are discussed using ""Vibrio anguillarum"" and ""Renibacterium salmoninarum"", the causative agents of vibriosis and bacterial kidney disease, respectively, as examples."
