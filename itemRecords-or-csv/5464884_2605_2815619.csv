12,Abstract:,"With extended fisheries jurisdiction, competition at the negotiating table has replaced competition on the fishing grounds. Thus, where a distant water fishing nation (DWFN) holds cost or market access advantages over competing DWFNs, these advantages will more likely be realized after extended fisheries jurisdiction than before. In addition, coastal countries may now compete for opportunities to cooperate with DWFNs in their own fishing zones. When coastal countries such as the U.S. substitute domestic fleets and processors for a foreign presence, they may lose both market access and opportunities for profitable cooperative fishing arrangements. This article explores some of these issues from a conceptual point of view and identifies some costs to coastal countries that fail to adapt to these developments."
