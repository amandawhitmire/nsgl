16,Abstract:,"The protamines are small, basic, arginine-rich proteins synthesized postmeiotically in the testes. Analysis of the regulation of synthesis of the protamine mRNA and protein is restricted by the difficulty in culturing and manipulating the cells in which transcription and translation occur. Reported here is the development of transgenic mice carrying protamine-""myc"" and protamine-Tag fusion genes; it is shown that the 5' flanking sequence for mP2 is sufficient for directing cell-specific transcription."
