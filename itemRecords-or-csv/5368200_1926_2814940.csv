12,,"To determine whether heavy mineral (e.g. garnet, ilmenite, augite, hornblende, hypersthene) grain shape affects sieving results, a beach placer was analyzed and sieved. Empirical relationships between average intermediate diameters of the grains and their sieved sizes are close enough to those for quartz to conclude that there would be little separation of the minerals by shape during the sieving process. Implications for evaluating heavy mineral sands by intermediate diameter distributions rather than by sieve size are noted."
