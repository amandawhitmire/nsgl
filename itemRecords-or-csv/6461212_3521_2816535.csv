9,Abstract:,"Prevention, early detection, and rapid response are the most cost-effective approaches to preventing the spread of invasive tunicates and associated invasive species. This illustrated guide is intended to enhance the early detection and rapid response of invasive tunicates by providing basic identification of nine of the most invasive tunicates posing a threat to the marine infrastructure, ecology, and economy of the Pacific Northwest coast. Sections on identification, similar species (those that may look similar, including natives), and ecology describe each of the nine invasive tunicates, and current distribution maps indicate areas where they've been found."
