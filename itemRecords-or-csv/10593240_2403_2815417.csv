13,Abstract:,"Policies and their influence on ecosystem management are ideally informed by the best available science. Cultural, institutional, and practical barriers can impede or bias that process. Recognizing this gap, and incentivized by funders, academic researchers increasingly collaborate beyond their disciplines and institutions and use stakeholder engagement in studies informing natural resources and ecosystems management. The NSF-funded “Climate Change and Water Sustainability – Willamette Water 2100” (WW2100) project brings together scientists from 12 disciplines in a co-learning realm with a diverse array of water users, managers, and regulators to develop and model future climate, population, and land-use policy scenarios to predict where, when, and how water scarcity might manifest and, in turn, how ecosystems, disturbances, and land-use may be impacted. This research characterizes the scientist-​stakeholder engagement process through three principle questions: 1) Who is participating? 2) Why are participants involved in this project? 3) What are the participants’ perceptions of the project’s process and outcome? Through a mixed methods approach including semi-structured interviews of key informants and survey data from a self-selected sample of the research and stakeholder population, this research takes a grounded-theory approach to understand the social dynamics and the outcome of a large transdisciplina​ry NSF project."
