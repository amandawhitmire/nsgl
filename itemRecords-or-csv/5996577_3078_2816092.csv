16,Abstract:,"""Morganella morganii"" was studied for its growth and histamine formation in mackerel, albacore, mahi-mahi, and salmon stored at various temperatures from -30 degrees C to 37 degrees C. The optimal temperature for histamine formation was 25 degrees C. Mackerel, albacore, and mahi- mahi were shown as good substrates for histidine decarboxylation by ""M. morganii"" at elevated temperatures (> 15 degrees C). ""M. morganii"" inoculated in all fish species including salmon formed histamine above the FDA guideline. Their growth was controlled by cold storage of the fish at 4 degree C or below, but histamine formation was controlled only by frozen storage. Although histamine was not detected in any frozen samples, it accumulated rapidly in the previously frozen fish stored at 25 degrees C."
