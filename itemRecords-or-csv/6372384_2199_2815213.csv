10,Abstract:,"The purposes of this study are to determine how salinity and substrate influence benthic macroinvertebra​te communities and to compare macroinvertebra​te diversity among four tidal marshes in the Salmon River Estuary. Benthic cores were collected at five random transect positions of the tidal channel in each marsh, from which macroinvertebra​te and substrate data will be taken. Salinity was measured at five stratified random transect positions nearest to the deepest section of each channel. Substrate will be quantified via sub-sampling of three 15 mL samples from each core. Preliminary macroinvertebra​te counts suggest differences in community composition among the marshes."
