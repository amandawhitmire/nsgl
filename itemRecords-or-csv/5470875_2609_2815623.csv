14,Abstract:,"A Caribbean cyanobacterium, ""Hormothamnion enteromorphoide​s"", was found to produce a complex mixture of ichthyotoxic peptides, perhaps explaining the apparent absence of predation upon these potentially palatable life forms. HPLC analyses indicate that the relative proportions of these peptide natural products remain relatively constant between different collection locations and years; however, they do vary seasonally. Clonal isolates of this cyanobacterium in culture produce the full spectrum of toxic peptides. Initial chemical descriptions are provided."
