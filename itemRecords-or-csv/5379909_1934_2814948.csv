10,Abstract:,"This article is a case study of the Bonneville Power Administration'​s (BPA's) decision not to perform an EIS on the long-term electric power contracts which the 1980 Northwest Power Act directed BPA to offer to its utility and industrial customers. Because the conditions of these power sale contracts can materially affect the operation of a series of dams comprising the federal Columbia River Power System, the largest interconnected hydroelectric system in the world, the contracts may significantly affect streamflows in the Columbia and Snake River basins, which are essential to the transportation of juvenile salmon and steelhead trout. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that BPA's interpretation of the Northwest Power Act exempting the power agency from compliance with NEPA was unreasonable, and that BPA should have adopted a course of action enabling the agency to satisfy NEPA procedures while also meeting the Northwest Power Act's concern for expeditious decision making on power sale contract terms. The article concludes by suggesting a number of issues that the court-ordered EIS ought to address to help improve fishery flows in the Columbia and Snake River basins."
