13,Abstract:,"Ozone, a potent oxidizing agent, has found wide application in sterilization and control of water quality in fresh-water systems. However, its application to seawater culture systems has been limited by its residual toxicity. This paper describes a method which employs activated charcoal to remove this residual toxicity. The ozone-charcoal treatment sequence should prove beneficial in maintaining water quality for rearing even very sensitive organisms such as oyster larvae."
