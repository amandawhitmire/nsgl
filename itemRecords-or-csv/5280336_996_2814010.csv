11,Abstract:,"This report's primary objective is to report the results of tests on the effects of various cathodic protection measures on the life of galvanized wire rope hooked directly to uncoated steel trawl doors. The report will examine results of OSU experiments with wire rope in a series of controlled dock-side experiments and in a series of experiments of cathodic protection measures applied at sea. The report also examines documented corrosion experience (much of which was done in U.S. Navy-funded tests over the last 15 or 20 years) and engineering recommendations for cathodic protection. A secondary objective is to examine and summarize documented engineering recommendations on the use, rigging, and construction of wire rope used for the purpose of trawl cables. The discussion in the report is limited to commonly used materials and constructions."
