10,Abstract:,"Properly preserved, wood can withstand the ocean' s harsh environment for decades; unprotected, wood cannot withstand wood-destroying organisms, which can reduce it to fragments. Marine borers, wood-rotting fungi, and certain insects cause more than $500 million in damages to wooden waterfront structures each year in the United States alone. Above the waterline, fungi and insects exact their toll, Below the marine waterline, woodboring animals, including gribbles, shipworms, .md pholads, have been a menace since wooden vessels first ventured onto the seas, thousands of years ago."
