9,Abstract:,"Life Cycle of a Lab: Research on the Klamath River gives you a behind-​the-​scenes look at how one university science lab works-the problems to be solved, the methods used in trying to solve them, the challenges encountered, the people working together to collect and analyze the data, and the relationships between the scientists and their individual areas of expertise. The lab featured is that of Oregon Sea Grant researcher Jerri Bartholomew, a professor in Oregon State University's Department of Microbiology."
