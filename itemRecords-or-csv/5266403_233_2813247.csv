12,Abstract:,"The Ocean Structural Dynamics Symposium 1982 was held at Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, September 6-10, 1982. Worldwide demand for resource production and distribution has increased offshore construction activities in deeper and more hostile ocean environments. A concern for material efficiencies and load moderation has led to greater reliance on compliant, fixed-​based and floating structures. The design of these structures requires a dynamic analysis of wind-​wave-​current-​structure interaction. The objective of this Ocean Structural Dynamics Symposium was to brine together researchers and engineers to review and discuss the current state of technology in the dynamic analysis and design of offshore structure, mooring and foundation systems.
