11,Abstract:,"A shortage of moorage space now exists at the small boat basin at Hammond, Oregon. The Town of Hammond Parks and Recreation Commission should increase and revise current moorage rates. The rates should rise only to levels approximately level to the long-run costs in current dollars! of providing moorage space at Hammond. The structure of moorage rates should be based on the moorage area occupied by each boat, not on boat length."
