11,Abstract:,"Who are the sea people, and how do you find your place among them? If we can blow away the sea mists that form a veil between impressions and reality, perhaps we can identify some sea careers and what they require in education and training. There are many kinds of sea careers and many more that are related to the sea in one way or another. There are careers for every kind of person, for every degree of education, for nearly every sort of interest. This booklet helps explain some of these careers. KW: MARINE CAREERS; EDUCATION."
