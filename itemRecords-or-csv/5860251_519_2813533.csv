13,Abstract:,"A team of engineering faculty and students from Oregon State University performed assessments at 10 seafood processors in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington. Goals were to increase energy efficiency, reduce waste, and improve productivity. This report is a summary of recommendations and common issues found in these plants. The assessment team identified annual savings of approximately $4.4 million in the energy, waste, and productivity areas. Total implementation cost was estimated to be $5.0 million for an average 1.1-year simple payback of investment. Data is presented separately for each of the three areas. This report is adapted from information reported in the Proceedings of the Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry, American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, 2001."
