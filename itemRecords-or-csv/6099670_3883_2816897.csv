15,Abstract:,"Floating, mixed-valent Fe films have been observed worldwide in wetlands, ferrous iron-rich seeps, and in seasonally reduced soils, but are usually misidentified as oil or biofilms. There has been little characterizatio​n or explanation of their formation. Along the Oregon coast such films were found on ephemeral pools where Fe(II)-rich groundwater (~100 μM Fe) has been discharged at the base of Pleistocene sand dunes. Fe(II) oxidized to Fe(III) at the air-water interface to form ~100?300 nm thick films. Analyses indicated that the films contained both Fe(III) and Fe(II) in a ratio of 3:1; Si was the other main cation; OH was the main anion and some C was also identified. The film morphology was flat under optical and electron microscopy with some attached floccules having a string-like morphology. Energy-filtered electron diffraction patterns showed three diffraction rings at 4.5, 2.6 and 1.4 � in some places and two rings (2.6 and 1.4 �) in others. Upon further oxidation the films became 2-line ferrihydrite. We are proposing the name 'schwimmeisen' for the floating, mixed-valent Fe film."
