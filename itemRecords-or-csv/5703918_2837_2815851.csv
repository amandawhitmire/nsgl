13,Abstract:,"A polyenoic fatty-acid isomerase from a red marine alga was used to convert anandamide to another eicosatetraenoy​l-​N-​ ethanolamide isomer. This novel eicosanoid, termed conjugated triene anandamide (CTA), was assessed for its ability to bind to the cannabinoid receptor in rat brain membrane preparations. CTA is a high affinity cannabimimetic substance whose novel structure provides new insight into structure-​activity relationships of cannabinoid receptor ligands. These experiments illustrate the utility of enzymes isolated from marine organisms in the development of pharmacological probes."
