12,Abstract:,"A novel sphingolipid containing an iso-fatty acid, (4E,8E)-N-13'- methyltetradeca​noyl-​1-​O-​beta-​D-​glucopyranosyl-​4-​sphingadiene, was isolated from the Oregon marine sponge ""Halichondria panicea"" and its structure determined using a combination of spectroscopic and chemical degradation techniques. A second galactosyl-​ceramide, which contained an unusually long chain fatty acid amide component, was also isolated from ""H. panicea""."
