15,Abstract:,"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) of fish causes an acute, contagious disease in juvenile rainbow and brook trout. Highly virulent strains may cause greater than 90% mortality in hatchery stocks and are, therefore, a major concern within the aquaculture industry. No preventive or therapeutic treatments exist other than the destruction of infected stocks and disinfection of the hatchery facilities. Reported here are results of cloning the viral genome of IPNV to establish a physical endonuclease map of the two RNA segments."
