14,Abstract:,"Coastal sea level, atmospheric pressure and wind speed and direction are measured routinely at Newport, Oregon, The tide gage is situated just inside Yaquina Bay and has been operating continuously since February 1967. Atmospheric pressure is measured at the Oregon State University Marine Science Center, very near the tide gage; pressure has been recorded since November 1970, The anemometer, in operation on the south jetty since March 1969, has good exposure in all directions except perhaps northeast and southeast, Each variable is digitized at hourly intervals, The wind data are used to calculate wind stress, and sea level and atmospheric pressure are combined to yield adjusted sea level. The hourly data of all five variables are filtered numerically to provide low-passed data and very-​low-​frequency data, which suppress fluctuations shorter than 46 hours and 51 days, respectively, For each variable, the data are summarized in tables of monthly and annual means, tables of annual standard deviations, and time series plots of the hourly data and each form of the filtered data. In addition, the wind data are displayed in the form of progressive vector diagrams, scatter diagrams of the vector components, and time series of cumulative Ekman transport."
