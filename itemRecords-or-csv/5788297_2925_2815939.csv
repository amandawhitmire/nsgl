15,Abstract:,"Mx proteins are members of a family of interferon-​inducible genes expressed when cells are treated with double-stranded RNA or virus infection. These proteins are important components of the antiviral response and form the first line of the body's defense against virus infections. Mammals have between two and three Mx genes whose functions may vary with regard to the inhibition of a specific virus, cellular localization, and activity. The cDNA of three rainbow trout Mx proteins has been cloned and a comparison of their sequences with that of avian and mammalian species reveals striking conservation of domains. Like the rat and human Mx proteins, the different trout Mx proteins exhibit distinctly different immunohistochem​ical staining patterns in cells transfected with plasmids. To date, the antiviral function of the trout Mx proteins has not been satisfactorily established."
