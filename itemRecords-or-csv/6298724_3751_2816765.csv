12,Abstract:,"Based on contributions at a 2009 symposium, this book has up-to-date information on innovative and lucrative product forms that can be created from seafood processing byproducts such as protein meals, fish oils, solubles, and fish bone. The significant ecological consequences of industrial fisheries, dedicated to making fish meals and oils for animal feeds, have been recognized recently. In addition, much of the processing byproduct derived from fish being prepared for human consumption can be made into human food ingredients. The 24 contributions are valuable reading for researchers and industry specialists."
