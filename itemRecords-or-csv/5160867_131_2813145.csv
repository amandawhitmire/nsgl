12,Abstract:,"The economic importance of Oregon's seafood industry has grown since Pacific Northwest Indians subsisted on a staple diet of sun-dried salmon. When the founding settlers came to the eastern shores of America hundreds of years ago, they were dependent upon fisheries for a staple food source. Since then demand for seafood has continued to increase. Today, many Oregon seafoods are enjoyed by consumers worldwide. This publication is one of the first attempts to describe Oregon's seafood industry in economic terms. It draws together information from many local, state, and federal sources. When data were not available, they were developed from basic sources."
