17,Abstract:,"The impact of a tsunami can vary greatly across short distances because of differences intopography, building structures, the concentration of economic activities in the inundation zone, and theeconomic links beyond the inundation zone. In this study, we take these factors into account in ananalysis of a potential tsunami on the west coast of the United States. An integrated engineeringecon​omicmodel is proposed that uses detailed information on spatial heterogeneities in flood depth andeconomic activity by connecting engineering estimates of tax-lot physical damages with economicactivit​y at the sector level. The performance of this new approach, in terms of estimated total losses andthe distribution of effects across sectors, is compared with two prominent alternatives: engineering-​onlyand economic-only. This study reveals special concerns of overestimation and inaccurate vulnerabilityas​sessment by the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Hazus program, which uses an inputoutput–bas​ed framework and lacks spatially explicit estimates of physical damages and economic losses."
