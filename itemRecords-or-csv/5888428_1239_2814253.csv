11,Abstract:,"In this chapter from the Federal Fisheries Investment Task Force's Report to Congress, the role of the federal government in the habitat loss of marine fish populations is addressed. Because excess fishing capacity results not only from investments in the fishing capital of fishing vessels and the human capital of fishermen, but also from the loss of the natural capital of fish stocks, the federal government has a continuing obligation to help fishing fleets adjust to loss of fishing opportunities caused by the federal government. The authors illustrate this point with three cases: Pacific salmon habitat, coastal wetlands in Louisiana, and the Florida Everglades."
