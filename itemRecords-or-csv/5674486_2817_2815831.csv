12,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus of salmonid fish that causes severe losses at hatcheries. Although vaccines for IHNV are under development, present control measures for the disease require testing of hatchery populations for the virus and destruction of infected populations. Virus typically is detected by isolating the virus in tissue culture and then confirming its identity via serum neutralization. These methods are sensitive for infectious virus but are labor intensive and often provide answers long after the epizootic. A polymerase chain reaction method has been developed to amplify a portion of the ""N"" gene of IHNV directly from viral genomic RNA in freshly sampled fish tissues. This method was shown to be rapid, specific and very sensitive. In this paper, a simple method for the detection of the ""N""-specific RNA purified from formalin-fixed, paraffin-â€‹embedded fish tissues is described."
