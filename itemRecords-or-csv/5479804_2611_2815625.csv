11,Abstract:,"The last decade has seen U.S. government and industry interest in seabed hard minerals shift from areas beyond national jurisdiction to those within national jurisdiction. A variety of factors-​-​technical, economic, political, legal--are behind this trend. This paper focuses on the legal aspects of federal and state efforts to encourage and regulate seabed minerals exploration activities, prospective avoidance of conflicts between seabed mining and other ocean uses, federal-state relations in seabed minerals development, and the special situation of mineral deposits spanning the federal-state boundary offshore."
