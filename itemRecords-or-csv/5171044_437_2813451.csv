11,Abstract:,"Aquaculture can potentially produce very high food yields from relatively small areas in which ponds or raceways provide a controlled environment. However, realizing this potentially high production requires that the aquaculture facility provide conditions that are as close to optimum as possible for the animal being cultured. At Oregon State University, we began research in 1971 on the potential beneficial uses of heated effluents in aquaculture. During the course of the study, we conducted experiments to assess the feasibility of culturing the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and several species of salmon in warmed seawater. Our objectives in this report are to discuss the results of our work with the Pacific oyster and to consider the feasibility of using heated effluents to culture this species intensively."
