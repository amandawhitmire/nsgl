12,Abstract:,"The papers presented during the symposium addressed the wild fish question from ne of four perspectives: management concerns, habitat needs, rebuilding efforts, and case histories of selected fisheries. What happens to the Northwest's wild trout, steelhead and salmon in the 21st century will be influenced by plans now on the drawing board. In particular, resource managers are attempting to establish the significance of wild fish, to define the impact of hatchery-​produced fish on their wild counterparts, to restore or mitigate for populations injured by hydropower developments, and to agree upon harvest management policies that sustain fish populations as well as fishermen. They are also beginning to confront the effects of agricultural practices on fish populations. Representatives of government agencies, Indian tribes and private organizations convened to address these concerns at a symposium whose proceedings are offered here. The following papers are included in this proceedings: 1. Wild fish management. Jim Lichatowich pp. 3-8. 2. Salmonid habitat: new beginnings through enhancement, but not without uncertainty, risk and failure. Fred Everest, et al. pp. 9-19. 3. Harvest management: will it work? Jim Martin pp. 20-23. 4. Who will catch tomorrow's fish, and where? An angler's view. Larry Schoenborn pp. 24-27. 5. Recouping our habitat losses with a Riparian vegetation strategy. James Sedell, et al. pp. 30-39. 6. Processes of Riparian systems: back to basics. Wayne Elmore pp. 40-43. 7. Oregon's water: past and future. Tom Simmons pp. 44-47. 8. Enhancement, restoration and mitigation: how are they different? Bill Bakke pp. 50-51. 9. Is ther a conflict between protection and enhancement? Kai Lee pp. 52-60. 10. Restoration of anadromous fish--not as simple as it sounds. Brian Brown and Dale Evans pp. 61-73. 11. How fish management can affect wild populations: a case study of the Clackamas River. Douglas Cramer pp. 76-86. 12. Wild fish in a tame river: the Yakima's story. Bob Tuck pp. 87-92. 13. Cultured and wild salmon populations in the Noatak River, Alaska. William Wilson pp. 93-110. 14.
