13,Abstract:,"A sharp change in the domestic utilization of whiting occurred in 1990-92 due to increased value of surimi on the global market and to advanced techniques to manufacture surimi from Pacific whiting. Other product forms of interest to the industry include the frozen fillets. Quality changes need to be studied to enable the fishing industry to develop guidelines for harvesting, handling, and processing. The objective of this study was to evaluate protein denaturation in frozen Pacific whiting fillets stored at four temperatures."
