11,Abstract:,"Ocean Engineering is a developing field where existing engineering technologies are being extended to effectively develop the resources of the marine environment. To promote greater understanding of Ocean Engineering techniques and to identify areas of needed research, a series of weekly lectures was arranged during the Winter Quarter of 1971 on the Oregon State University Campus. Speakers were invited to give addresses to a wide range of technical and legal subjects dealing with problems involving the ocean and coastal environment. Students attending the seminars participated in exchanges with the speakers to hear about ocean engineering challenges and opportunities. It is hoped the reader will find the following papers interesting while reading of the efforts of leading professionals who have successfully dealt with marine and coastal problems. The following papers are included in this document: Ocean Food Resources and the Future of Mariculture, by William J. McNeil; Ocean Zones and Boundaries, by Jon L. Jacobsen; Use of Estuaries for Navigation and Port Development, by Ogden Beeman; Engineering in Navigable Waters, by Robert J. Hopman; Pollution: The Crime of the Times, by Commander Richard F. Malm; Environment and Technology in Marine Mining; Mining and Mineral Recovery 1969, by Michael J. Cruikshank; Some Considerations for Buoys and Their Moorings, by John Nath; Wave and Their Effects on Pile Supported Structures, by Robert L. Wiegel; A Brief Review of the Moored Instrumentation Platforms Used for Oceanographic Research at Oregon State University; by Roderick Mesecar; and Corrosion in the Marine Environment, by William D. McMullen."
