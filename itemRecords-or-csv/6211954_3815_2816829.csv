15,Abstract:,"Hypoxia is a common symptom of degraded water quality that often results from anthropogenic activities (e.g., nutrient pollution). Recognized as a threat to ecosystems worldwide, the occurrence of hypoxia in coastal waters has increased steadily over the past 50 years. The formation of hypoxia is typically the result of interactions among water column stratification, biologic processes, nutrient inputs, and other factors. Although hypoxia is an inherent feature in many ecosystems, increased anthropogenic nutrient inputs and other environmental perturbations have increased both the frequency of occurrence and intensity of naturally occurring hypoxia and has induced its occurrence in ecosystems where it had not been previously documented. In the United States, hypoxia has been found in over 300 ecosystems and often forms seasonally. Although the primary factors causing hypoxia are fundamentally understood in many ecosystems, the impacts of hypoxia on living resources and food webs are far less known."
