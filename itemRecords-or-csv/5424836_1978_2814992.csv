11,Abstract:,"The objective of this research was to determine whether the detection of predator chemical stimuli by juvenile coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") would elicit behavioral or physiological reactions or both. Extracts from the broken skin of squawfish or suckers induced a physiological stress response, thereby raising the possibility of a nonostariophysaâ€‹n fish recognizing an ostariophysan alarm substance. Rinses from human skin or L-serine were behaviorally avoided, but neither stimulus induced physiological stress responses. A conclusion from these results is that behavioral and physiological reactions to the chemical stimuli from predators do not necessarily co-occur."
