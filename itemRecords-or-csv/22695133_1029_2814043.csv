13,Abstract:,"Photographic evidence collected over the past decade indicate that seagrass abundance at Valino Island in South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve has declined over recent time. Is seagrass wasting disease the culprit, and what are the ecological impacts of reduced seagrass abundance? Lear​ning Goals: Students in grade levels 9-12 will learn the following: • Seagrass communities provide important ecosystem services. • Researchers use quantitative methods to determine whether there are changes in seagrass abundance over time. • Seagrass wasting disease is caused by a protist and is causing changes in seagrass abundance in at least one Oregon coastal estuary. Learni​ng Objectives: Students will be able to: 1. Describe basic seagrass biology and ecology, as well as threats faced by seagrasses; 2. Use quadrats to sample an ecosystem for species density; 3. Use quantitative reasoning to assess the incidence, magnitude, and impact of wasting disease on seagrasses in the South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve; 4. Analyze data to make a conclusion about ecosystem health."
