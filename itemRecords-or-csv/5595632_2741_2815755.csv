14,Abstract:,"Protein profiles and serological characteristics of 3 rhabdoviruses from snakehead fish ""Ophicephalus striatus"" were determined and compared to 5 known fish rhabdoviruses and 1 mammalian rhabdovirus. The snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV) exhibited a bacilliform morphology and a Lyssavirus-type protein profile. The ulcerative disease rhabdovirus isolates (UDRV-BP and UDRV-19) were indistinguishab​le and exhibited bullet-shaped morphology and a Vesiculovirus-​type protein profile. At present, none of the 3 viruses is known to be the cause of disease in any species of fish. UDRV-BP and UDRV-19 were serologically identical but distinct from SHRV and from 5 other fish rhabdoviruses. SHRV was serologically unrelated to any of the fish rhabdoviruses examined."
