12,Abstract:,A weakly nonlinear solution is presented for the 2-D wave kinematics forced by a generic wavemaker of variable draft. The solution is valid for both piston and hinged wavemakers of variable-draft that may be double articulated. The second-order propagating waves generated by a planar wave board comprise two components: a Stokes second-order wave and a second-harmonic wave forced by the wavemaker which travels at a different speed. A previously neglected time-​independent solution required to satisfy a kinematic boundary condition of the free surface is included for the first time. A component of the time-​independent solution accurately estimates the mean return current in a closed wave flume. This means return current is usually estimated from kinematic considerations by a conservation of mass principle.
