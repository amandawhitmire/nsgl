13,Abstract:,"Because of its high strength, renewability, and relatively low cost, Douglas-fir is an ideal choice for many important uses. Properly designed, constructed, and maintained, structures of this wood can provide long service, even in the ocean's harsh environment. This manual, cosponsored by the Forest Research Laboratory and the Sea Grant College Program of Oregon State University, is a companion to the previously published ""Wood Pole Maintenance Manual"" (Graham and Helsing 1979). It is directed to inspectors of marine wood and provides basic information on wood and wood-destroying organisms (borers) that harbormasters, port managers, and maintenance personnel can use in making wise decisions maintaining the waterfront structures in their charge. Designers and builders may also find this manual helpful in avoiding construction practices that contribute to wood deterioration. The savings could amount to many millions of dollars annually. You, the well-trained inspector, play a major role in achieving these savings. Early recognition of deterioration leads to mare economical repairs and remedial treatments to control the problem."
