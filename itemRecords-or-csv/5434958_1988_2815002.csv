11,Abstract:,"It is argued that existing federal land-based agencies provide a suitable template for a United States Ocean Resources Service (USORS). The extent to which the structure and legislative mandates of the U.S. Forest Service might provide a model for the USORS is examined with respect to (1) leadership and division structure, (2) functional area structure, (3) field unit operations, and (4) legislative chain. Possible advantages and disadvantages of such a system are summarized."
