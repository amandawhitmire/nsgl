10,Abstract:,"This report describes the nearshore wave climatology off Yaquina Bay (Newport), Oregon for the period October 1971-March 1981, and extends the time period for the wave climatology reported earlier, Creech (1977). It includes a brief description of the wave measurement system, calibration procedures, and data reduction techniques employed. Resulting data are presented as tables and diagrams showing mean, percentage exceedance, occurrence and persistence of given conditions; three-month time history plots of wave height and period are also included for the entire record length."
