10,Abstract:,"In the last few years, researchers have discovered that marine organisms use simple polyunsaturated fatty acids to form complex oxylipins resembling those produced by mammalian systems. The intent of this review is to examine and update the subset of marine-derived oxylipins that possess the most 'intriguing' structures-​-​that is, structures that are both sophisticated and related to substances of mammalian importance. The review is confined to those marine oxylipins containing at least one carbocyclic ring. The material covered is arranged by degree of ring complexity, starting with metabolites containing monocarbocyclic rings and ending with bicarbocyclic oxylipins."
