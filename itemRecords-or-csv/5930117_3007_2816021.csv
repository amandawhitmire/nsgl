11,Abstract:,"Physicochemical changes of surimi seafood under electron beam (e-beam) and heat were investigated in this study. While heat caused browning and texture softening, e-beam (up to 4 kGy) deteriorated neither color nor texture. Heat, as compared to e-beam, generated the same headspace volatiles, however, to a greater extent. E-beam was determined to be an excellent pasteurization alternative for surimi seafood in terms of retention of fresh-like physicochemical attributes."
