8,Abstract:,"To focus shellfish restoration and farming efforts, shellfish initiatives have been developed for Washington, Oregon, and California. The Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission provided funding to the Mississippi-​Alabama Sea Grant Consortium to advance the nation’s first regional shellfish initiative. The Gulf of Mexico Shellfish Initiative (GoMexSI) team engaged a broad range of stakeholders including shellfish farmers, shellfish harvesters, environmental organizations, state and local management agencies, foundations, and others to identify strategies to be implemented in the future to ensure sustainable shellfish populations for current and future generations. Regional and state-specific priorities and concerns have been identified by stakeholders through a series of face-​toface meetings, an online survey, and personal communications to capture their feedback on shellfish resources in the Gulf of Mexico."
