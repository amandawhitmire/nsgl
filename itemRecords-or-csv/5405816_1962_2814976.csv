10,Abstract:,"Spatial equilibrium models are criticized for a failure to accurately reflect observed trade flows. Trade data show that countries import the `same' commodities from several sources, not just from that source which minimizes transportation costs. Countries may want to diversify the sources of their imports for many reasons, including a desire to reduce the effects of a possible embargo by a supplier, to guard against other trade restrictions or for good political relations with other countries. This paper presents a method for making the spatial equilibrium model more realistic by allowing for a preference for diversifying trading partners. The model is a combination of the spatial equilibrium model and the minimization of total absolute deviation (MOTAD) model."
