13,Abstract:,"An obligately intracellular bacterium has been isolated and identified as the etiologic agent of an epizootic disease resulting in extensive mortality among salmonid fish reared in the Pacific Ocean coastal waters of South America. Losses to this disease were reported in 1989 to range from 30 to 90% of the coho salmon held in seawater netpens at many sites in southern Chile. Initially the disease was thought to be confined to coho salmon, but infectivity studies with the isolated organism demonstrated pathogenicity for both coho and Atlantic salmon, and, in 1990, major losses were recorded among the Atlantic salmon cultured in southern Chile. Chinook salmon and rainbow trout held at saltwater rearing sites also experienced mortality attributed to this agent. A new genus and species (""Pisciricketts​ia salmonis"" gen. nov., sp. nov.) are proposed for this organism, with ATCC(R) VR 1361 as the type strain."
