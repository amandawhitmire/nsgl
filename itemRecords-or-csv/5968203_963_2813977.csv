11,Abstract:,"The standing stocks of ciliates and phytoplankton together with physical variables (temperature and density) were measured biweekly for one year in the marine-​dominated region of the South Slough of the Coos Bay estuary, Oregon. The abundance and biomass of naked ciliates correlated significantly with ultraphytoplank​ton (phytoplankton less than 5 micrometers) biomass throughout the sampling periods and with total phytoplankton biomass between October and March. Temperature could explain 49 percent of the variation of ultraphytoplank​ton and naked ciliate biomass across seasons and may be important in determining the rate of the ciliate numerical response to increases in ultraphytoplank​ton and its assimilation into ciliate biomass. High standing stocks of ciliates, their strong coupling with ultraphytoplank​ton across seasons, and the relatively higher contribution of ciliate carbon to the ciliate and larger phytoplankton carbon pool in the October-March period suggest that ciliates are a significant component to the South Slough food web and may be particularly important during seasons of reduced phytoplankton biomass."
