10,Abstract:,"Marine debris poses a threat to our environment, human health, and the economy. The Northwest Straits Foundation has spent the past decade searching for lost nets in the vicinity of Puget Sound. This video is just one day in the life of those biologists, environmentalis​ts, scuba divers, and government officials committed to addressing one form of marine debris. This is a production of Oregon Sea Grant in cooperation with NOAA West and the West Coast Sea Grant programs."
