16,Abstract:,"Navigating along the Oregon coast presents difficult challenges to the most experienced boat operator. Sand shoals or bars, river and tidal currents, ocean swells and winds can combine to create dangerous conditions to vessels of all sizes. Pleasant sea and weather conditions can change quickly on the open ocean and bar entrances. This publication presents information on these waters that every boater should have. The descriptions are illustrated with aerial views of the channel entrances and annotated charts. There are also sections on general coastal boating concerns: storm warnings, aids to navigation, U.S. Coast Guard Stations, and safety equipment."
