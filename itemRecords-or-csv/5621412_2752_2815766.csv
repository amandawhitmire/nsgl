13,Abstract:,"The effect of heat sterilization on quality and nutrient retention of foods has been a major concern for processors since the canning industry was first established. This concern prompted studies into different means to predict these quality changes by using mathematical models that predict bacterial destruction and loss of nutrients. These models are based on experimental kinetic studies for the quality factor(s) of interest. The choice of which procedure to use, steady-state or unsteady-state, depends to some degree on the availability of equipment and mathematical models. It should be noted that large differences in the values for kinetic parameters have been noted in comparing steady-state and unsteady-state procedures. The aim of this study was to develop an unsteady-state method to determine the kinetic parameters for the heat destruction of thiamine in conduction- heating foods."
