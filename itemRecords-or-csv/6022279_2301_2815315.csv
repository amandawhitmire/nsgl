9,Abstract:,"Iron-bearing films have been documented worldwide, but with little characterizatio​n or explanation of their formation. Along the Oregon coast the films are found on ephemeral surface pools where ferrous iron discharges from the groundwater. Example sites occur at the base of Pleistocene sand dunes at Seal Rock State Park and Driftwood Creek Wayside. At these pools the iron oxidizes and a film of about 300 nm thin forms. The major constituents of the film are iron and silica in a 3:1 ratio based on Scanning Electron Microscopy - Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Seal Rock films have higher concentrations of chlorine and sodium, likely due to increased sea- spray. Fourier Transfer Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicates OH bonds, carbon peaks and peaks similar to ferrihydrite. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) show patterns similar to 2-line ferrihydrite, with lines around 2.6 A and 1.5 A. A third line at 4.5 A is also present in some areas. Halite and quartz are also found in association with the film. HRSEM-EDS of the film and flocculent find that carbon is more concentrated in the flocculent. Colormetric testing finds the film has some mixed valence, roughly 1:5 Fe(II) to Fe(III). Atomic Emission Spectrometry (AES) and Ion Chromatography (IC) analysis of the pool water finds concentrations of reduced iron to be 9 ppm, silica 7 ppm, sodium 60 ppm, and chlorine 85 ppm. The average pH was between 5 and 6. Optical microscopy and SEM find no bacteria in the film or in the water of the pools. High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (HRSEM) indicates that there may be iron-oxidizing bacteria in the flocculent on the films. Due to the absence of bacteria directly attached to the films I conclude they are abiotically formed through oxidation at the air-water interface. As oxidation continues the bacteria may attach to the oxidizing film, which falls to the bottom of the seep pool when oxidation is complete. These iron-bearing films form where iron and silica in reducing groundwater are exposed to oxidizing conditions in surface pools and seeps."
