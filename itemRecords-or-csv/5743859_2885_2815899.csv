12,Abstract:,"This study describes the distribution of recent recruits and older juvenile Dover sole in relation to depth and physical environmental variables. This information is a prerequisite for further evaluation of Hayman and Tyler's recruitment hypothesis. They describe seasonal settlement timing, distribution, and abundance during a single year, 1989, and annual variation based upon March samples for the 6-year period 1989-1994."
