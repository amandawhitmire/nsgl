14,Abstract:,"Valued in many areas of the world for its ability to stabilize shorelines and reclaim land from the sea, ""Spartina"" has become, in some areas where it has been introduced, not only a weed but a noxious weed whose vigorous growth alters the intertidal zone and overwhelms established species. The spread of exotic ""Spartina"" species into bays and estuaries is viewed with concern. In Willapa Bay, Washington, one species of ""Spartina"" introduced accidentally within the last century now threatens to degrade views and water access, wildlife habitats and natural preserves, oyster beds, and nursery areas for crab, salmon, and sole. California, Oregon, and other parts of Washington report similar incursions. In November 1990, researchers and other concerned citizens gathered in Seattle, Washington, to discuss what could and should be done to stop or mitigate the spread of ""Spartina."" This book is a record of that two-day workshop."
