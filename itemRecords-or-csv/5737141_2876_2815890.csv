12,,"Important aspects in the design of composite breakwaters are the determination of the wave-induced forces and moments on the caisson. The wave pressure on the face and base of the caisson can cause sliding or overturning failures. Various techniques have been proposed which address these questions in a rather piecemeal manner. In the present study, a coupled flow field model is developed to theoretically examine the interaction of waves with a composite breakwater. Analytical and numerical models have been developed for the interaction of simple periodic, linear wave with a caisson founded on a coarse rubble base. For the high permeability rubble typically used as the caisson foundation, the pressure distribution along the caisson base is nearly linear."
