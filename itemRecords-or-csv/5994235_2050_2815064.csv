15,Abstract:,"Most U.S. fish stocks are fully or over-exploited, and harvesting in many fisheries exceeds sustainable levels. the individual fishing quota (IFQ) is a relatively new instrument under which harvesting privileges are allocated to individual fishermen. It is considered innovative yet controversial for its feared effects on fishing communities and individual fishermen. This book provides definitions and examples, reviews legislation and regulations, and includes lessons learned from fisheries on the U.S. East Coast, Alaska, Iceland, New Zealand, and other regions. The committee discusses the public trust doctrine, management of common-pool resources, alternative and complementary approaches to the IFQ, and more. Sharing the Fish provides straightforward answers that will be important to fishery policymakers and regulators, natural resource economists, fishery managers, environmental advocates, and concerned fishermen and their communities."
