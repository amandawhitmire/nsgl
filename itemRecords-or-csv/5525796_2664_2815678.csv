11,Abstract:,"Rubble stability is a key consideration in the design of many types of nearshore structures. Present design techniques rely heavily upon empirical results. To advance the design of rubble structures beyond these approaches requires an understanding of the wave-structure interactions. This paper synthesizes previous results to analytically predict rubble stability. While this approach is still in the early stages of development, results are encouraging. Three specific aspects are: (1) hydrodynamic analysis of a toe employing a wave-rubble interaction model, (2) hydrodynamic analysis of a caisson-type breakwater, and (3) development of a rubble stability model based on the hydrodynamic forces on individual stones."
