10,Abstract:,"The information in this publication is based on more than 10 years of experience in organizing and conducting comprehensive management studies in the Pacific Northwest. Companies that have not benefited directly from comprehensive management studies can still benefit from the experience of others through this publication. Opportunities for improvement found in many of the studies are presented here in the form of a comprehensive management study report to Beaver Seafoods, a purely fictitious seafood business."
