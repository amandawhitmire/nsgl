9,Abstract:,"Oyster relaying is one of the means by which oystermen increase the net return from their leases. Using a Poisson regression model, this research evaluates the factors affecting the demand for relaying permits by the oyster industry in Louisiana, the nation's leading oyster producing state. Economic factors and prevailing environmental conditions were found to significantly influence the number of permits demanded."
