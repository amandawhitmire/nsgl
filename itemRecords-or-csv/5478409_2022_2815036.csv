12,Abstract:,"This study reports a fortuitous observation of catastrophic prawn mortality in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia. Submersible dives were being made to study the vertical distribution of prawns on the walls of the fjord. On the third day, October 8, 1986, examination of collected live prawns showed no evidence of disease or parasitism. Dead prawns, sometimes consisting only of exoskeleton remains, were observed at a density of 2/m2 in some areas; dead and dying prawns were also observed during both dives on October 9. The observed mortality was apparently caused by a water mass containing low levels of dissolved oxygen which suddenly intruded into the prawn habitat. Two possible explanations are (1) a change in the amplitude of oscillations of the oxycline and (2) an overall change in level of the mean oxygen surfaces, perhaps related to a change in subsurface properties."
