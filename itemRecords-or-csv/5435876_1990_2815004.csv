12,Abstract:,"An infinite eigenseries expansion is presented for the hydrodynamic pressure and for the dynamic response to earthquake excitation of a circular cylindrical structure having uniform stiffness and surrounded by a compressible fluid. The solution requires only a single summation over the eigenfunctions and eliminates the need for a double summation over both the eigenfunctions and the trial functions as is required by Rayleigh-Ritz methods. The analytical solution presented is valid only for the special case of a totally immersed, vertical circular cylindrical structure having both uniform stiffness and a uniform mass distribution."
