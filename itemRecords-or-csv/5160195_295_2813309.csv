11,Abstract:,"Oregon's fishing industry is made up of ""people"" as well as ""fish"". While much previous research and education has relied upon knowledge of ""fish,"" the importance of an understanding of the ""people"" in the industry is beginning to be recognized. This publication attempts to identify who and what some of these people are. The information provided here, combined with data from other sources, can act as a guide to developing research and educational programs for people in the fishing industry."
