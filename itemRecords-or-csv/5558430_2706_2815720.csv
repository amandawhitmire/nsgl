11,Abstract:,"The thermal properties of frozen foods are of interest to food engineers in modeling freezing and frozen storage processes and in designing equipment. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been used successfully to analyze thermal properties of frozen food. This is a report of research in which DSC was used to analyze thermal properties of surimi, an intermediate raw minced fish material which is typically thawed from the frozen state to make seafood analogs. DSC demonstrated great potential for measuring and modeling frozen food thermal properties."
