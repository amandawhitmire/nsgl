8,Abstract:,"The ""Intertidal Warfare"" exhibit (displayed at the Hatfield Marine Science Center Visitor Center in Newport, Oregon) is an interactive display that explores the complex and sometimes brutal interspecies interactions within intertidal zones, as interpreted by animated characters. Still images and lively descriptions capture the drama. Eye level scale looking for patterns with the naked eye."
