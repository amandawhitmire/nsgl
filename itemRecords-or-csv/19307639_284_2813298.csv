11,Abstract:,"Oregon Sea Grant coordinates an annual underwater robotics competition that tests students' engineering and problem-solving skills and aims to prepare them for technical careers. The event, known as the Oregon Regional MATE ROV Competition, is one of about 30 regional contests around the world in which students qualify for the annual international competition. In 2017, when this video was filmed, the Oregon competition was held in Lincoln City. This video was filmed and edited by Oregon State Productions with funding from Oregon Sea Grant and published on July 21, 2017."
