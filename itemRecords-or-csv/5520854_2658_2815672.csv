12,Abstract:,"Physical and psychological stress can impair immune function and lead to reduced disease resistance in vertebrates. There may also be feedback from the immune system that ultimately regulates the interrenal of teleosts. Such a system is apparent in mammals where recent evidence demonstrates that control of the HPA axis can be exerted by lymphocyte or macrophage products. The objective of this paper is to consider this possibility by presenting recent findings which suggest that elements of the immune system produce a factor that may be inhibitory to corticosteroid production by the interrenal of coho slamon ""Oncorhynchus kisutch."""
