11,Abstract:,"In the beginning I had reservations, True, the idea was exciting and made good academic sense. We would design a course and conference entitled ""Literature and the Sea"" and thereby establish a framework within which artists, humanists, and scientists could work together to determine the impact that the world' s oceans have had on the creative impulse of the writer as well as investigate how the writer has helped to shape prevailing notions about the sea. For though our objective was the noble one of fusing the many cultures, the fact is that any viable or enduring union depends upon the recognition that there are inherent differences between the arts, the sciences and the humanities. And if we hoped that our artists and scientists would be able to talk with one another in any sort of meaningful fashion, that either group would be able to talk with humanists, and that the students in the class and our conference audience would be able to make sense out of what might appear to be a chaotic assortment of approaches and directions, we had to identify those crucial differences. This done, we felt we could move toward an understanding of the common ground shared by everyone involved in the program, irrespective of academic discipline. The scientist formulates theories which refer to and explain relationships discovered in an already existing world. The artist neither formulates nor explains, He creates. Between the artist and the scientist there is the humanist-​critic."
