18,Abstract:,"The collapse of the Pacific Northwest salmon fishery is causing fishermen to turn increasingly toward the albacore tuna fishery as an alternative source of income; however, improper handling of albacore can cause the fish to produce histamine, a toxin that can be controlled by rapidly chilling and holding the fish at a low temperature. The goal of this study was to establish optimal chilling procedures by learning more about the relationships between internal fish temperatures and the ways those fish are chilled and stored onboard."
