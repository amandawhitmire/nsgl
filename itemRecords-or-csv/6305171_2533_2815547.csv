8,Abstract:,"The ""Refraction in Degrees"" exhibit (displayed at the Hatfield Marine Science Center Visitor Center in Newport, Oregon) is a super-sized refractometer which demonstrates how light refraction can be used to measure salinity. The laser pointer will show dots at different points depending on the salinity of the vial of water through which its beam is directed. Scientists and aquarists use refractometers to monitor salinity on a daily basis."
