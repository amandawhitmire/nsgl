18,Abstract:,"During the l979 meetings of the American Agricultural Association, a workshop, attended by several fishery economists, was held to discuss approaches to the study of factors affecting international trade in seafoods. This and several subsequent workshops were funded by the Oregon State University and the University of Alaska Sea Grant College Programs and led to the decision to form a team of researchers from several countries in the world. Since then, economists from several seafood-​trading countries have combined efforts to explore trade issues. Coming from universities, government bodies, and private industry, the researchers are brought together by a common interest in fisheries issues and a willingness to try a team approach to research. The present volume, the first in a series, describes aspects of fisheries in five countries. It is designed to serve as a basis for communication among researchers, familiarize readers with aspects of seafood distribution in these countries, and provide an indication of the kinds of data available and their compatibility across countries. The report is descriptive. Future reports will be a mixture of description and analysis. This is the beginning of an experiment in international cooperation whose long-range consequences will, we hope, be far-reaching. SEAFOOD;MARKET;​POLICY;PROCESSI​NG;FISHERY"
