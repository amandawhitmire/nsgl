11,Abstract:,"As part of an extensive survey of the biomedicinal potential of seaweed extracts from the Pacific Northwest of the U.S., the crude lipid extract of ""C. simplex"" (Seal Rock, Oregon) was found to contain a diversity of likely eicosanoid-type natural products. Two new cyclopropyl- and lactone-​containing eicosanoids, constanolactone A and B, were isolated as synthetic diacetate derivatives. A hydrolysis product of one of these helped to define the lactone size in these new eicosanoids."
