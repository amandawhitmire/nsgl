14,Abstract:,"Bromoperoxidase is an enzyme found in marine macroalgae that catalyzes the bromination of organic substrates. The first objective of this work is to demonstrate that the macrophytic marine red alga ""Ochtodes secundiramea"" microplantlets can be cultivated as a liquid suspension in a bubble-column photobioreactor​. The second objective is to show that bromoperoxidase is present in ""O. secundiramea"" microplantlets. The third objective is to profile the specific bromoperoxidase activity in the ""O. secundiramea"" microplantlets during the exponential and stationary phases of growth within a bubble-column photobioreactor​."
