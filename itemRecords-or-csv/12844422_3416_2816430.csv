22,Abstract:,"Listed in this full-color, 12-page guide are nine known, potentially invasive species to watch for on marine debris, including Japanese tsunami debris. As of May 2015, each of these species has been found on large structures of marine origin (docks, boats, pilings, and pallets, for example) that have washed onto North American shores from the 2011 Japanese tsunami."
