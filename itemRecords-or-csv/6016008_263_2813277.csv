10,Abstract:,"The northern Oregon coast suffers extensive loss of land as a result of landslides which constitute the primary mechanism of coastline recession. Both real property and structures along the coast have been destroyed and this destruction will continue. In certain instances, it may be feasible to protect property by engineered construction. In an attempt to propose effective methods for stabilization of potential landslides, the landslide problem on the Oregon coast is studied and a general analytical model of the landslide mechanism is presented. By means of the model, the critical factors governing slope stability are determined, applicability of various stabilization methods are assessed and recommendations are made. The northern Oregon coast is composed mainly of Tertiary (2 million to 60 million years old) sedimentary rock with unconformable deposits of Pleistocene (20,000 to 2 million years old) sandstones, siltstones, mudstones and shales which are often exposed in the terraces. The younger weakly cemented sediments are composed mainly of silts and sands with layers of gravel, coarse sand, fossil wood, peat and minor beds of sandy clay. Many coastal landslides have occurred in these latter materials. Headlands are in the main, composed of resistant igneous basalts and andesites of volcanic origin. Figure 1 indicates, in a general way, the geology of the northern Oregon Coast and generally recognized areas where landslides are known to have occurred. South of Heceta Head the coastline is rugged and composed mainly of igneous cliffs and small bays. Between Cape Blanco and Coos Bay the coast borders the Coastal Range where several uplifted marine terraces are found. Narrow sand beaches are found at the base of the cliffs. Resistant igneous headlands are found at Cape Blanco and Cape Arago and smaller headlands occur near the mouth of the Coquille River where the coast is low and backed by stabilized dunes. Large coastal sand dunes of up to 10 meters in height are found between Coos Bay and Heceta Head. Between Heceta Head and the Columbia River there are many uplifted marine terraces forming low cliffs rising from narrow beaches. The terraces are interrupted by several headlands. Both active and stable sand dunes are evident along this stretch of coast. Landsliding is most active in the area north of Heceta Head Rock lithology, structure and stratigraphy have dictated the shape of the coast, its rate of erosion and geomorphic changes. Byrne considers lithology to be the most important factor controlling coastal modification. However, the structural factors such as fractures, bedding attitude, faults and joints are of direct importance to landsliding as well."
