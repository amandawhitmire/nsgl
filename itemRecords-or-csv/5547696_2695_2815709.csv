11,Abstract:,"Vaccination ranks as one of the greatest successes of medicine, with some of the planet's most pernicious diseases eradicated or well controlled. Despite this success, technical limitations have so far restricted the number of commercially-â€‹produced human vaccines to twenty and veterinary vaccines to about fifty. Many microbial pathogens continue to present serious problems, but recent advances in biotechnology signal the real promise of increasing substantially our success in producing new vaccines, especially the use of recombinant DNA techniques. In spite of the pessimistic view expressed by vaccine manufacturers about the economic viability of developing recombinant vaccines, it is important that basic reserch is maintained, especially in those situations which are threatening the very survival of the industry and where there is little hope of developing vaccines along traditional lines."
