12,Abstract:,"Recent reports issued by two commissions that were set up to study U.S. fishery management mark the first time since the Stratton Commission in 1969 that U.S. ocean policy has been subjected to a systematic and broad-scale assessment. The next year or so will be a defining time for this policy: as of August 2004, about 40 bills with one or more recommendations from the commissions had been introduced in Congress. The question for policymakers is not only the direction of change for fishery management but also its sequence. We need to address the immediate problems of U.S. fisheries by setting hard limits on catches, allocating the catch to individuals, separating the decisions regarding catch limits and allocation, and allocating shares of the resource to the public. Once those acute issues have been addressed, efforts to make longer-term, fundamental changes are more likely to succeed. Two of the more important proposed changes are reorienting fishery policy toward ecosystems and reorganizing the institutional structure of ocean policy."
