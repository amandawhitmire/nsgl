13,Abstract:,More is understood about the pathogens of fish than the bacteria which compose the normal flora. The authors describe the bacteria that one might expect to isolate from fin fish and comment on those which are pathogenic and those which are known to constitute part of the normal fish microflora. The known presence of one bacterium should not preclude a search for other less obvious microorganisms that might be present. Bacteria initially isolated from the specimens during epizootics are frequently opportunistic or secondary invaders that become prevalent only after the activity of a primary pathogen.
