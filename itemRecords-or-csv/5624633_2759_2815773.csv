11,Abstract:,"Piscirickettsio​sis has resulted in extensive losses among salmonid fishes cultured in southern Chile. Near Puerto Montt, recurring epizootics have frequently resulted in mortality approaching 90% among the coho salmon cultured there. Three other salmonids reared in these waters are also subject to the disease. A unique rickettsial agent, ""Piscirickettsi​a salmonis"", has been isolated and demonstrated to be the causative agent of piscirickettsio​sis. The obligately intracellular nature of ""P. salmonis"" and its occurrence only in salt water suggest that a natural reservoir of infection is maintained; identification of this source of infection and elucidation of the natural mode(s) of transmission of the agent are high research priorities."
