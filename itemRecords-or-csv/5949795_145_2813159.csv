7,Abstract:,"This DVD provides highlights of the research, outreach, and education activities of the Oregon Sea Grant program. It is composed of video excerpts originally produced for various audiences, so not only will viewers sample the range of Oregon Sea Grant activities, they will also sample a range of storytelling approaches. For example, some video excerpts are parts of specific series intended for informal learners: 'The fun of science,' and 'How do they know that?' Other videos were produced for special occasions."
