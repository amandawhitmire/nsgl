9,Abstract:,"Environmental education is an essential component of natural resource management and one significant element of environmental education is a field trip. Given the growing interest in coastal and ocean ecosystems, one of the popular destinations for Oregon school field trips is rocky intertidal areas along the coast. Currently, no hard data are available on the absolute number of schools visiting rocky intertidal areas for field trips. However, the use of these areas for this purpose is judged to be significant and probably increasing. This study can be considered a ""first step"" in an effort to understand and encourage, but more effectively manage, school group use of Oregon's rocky intertidal areas. Three qualitative methods were used for this project: interviews of park managers and scientists, an on-line teacher survey, and observation of rocky intertidal use by visitors. The interview results show that the majority of school children are not adequately prepared for rocky intertidal field trips, including information about the ecology of the environment, rocky shore safety, and tidepool etiquette. Part of the problem is that there are no uniform procedures requiring teachers to get permission from the agency with rocky shore management responsibility, or requiring park managers and nonprofits to provide consistent guidelines to school groups. A variety of management strategies have been employed successfully at selected coastal sites, but mostly on an ad hoc basis. These techniques, such as area closures, use of local volunteers, and guided walks should be evaluated for possible institutionaliz​ing coast-wide. School group use and impacts need to be managed better because the well-planned and executed rocky intertidal field trip has inherent educational value for its lessons in environmental stewardship. Management should focus on improved (and required) communication between teachers organizing field trips and park staff or nonprofit groups managing the rocky shore and assisting with field trips; development of improved educational materials; and improved record keeping and monitoring that allows for evaluating impacts and carrying capacity. It is hoped that this project will help management agencies to provide appropriate recreational and educational opportunities for visitors specifically school groups, while protecting and conserving rocky shore resources. Recommendations from this study are as follows: Oregon Parks and Recreation Department (OPRD), in cooperation with other relevant agencies and organizations, should convene regular workshops so that parks staff, nonprofits, teachers, and scientists can share information about what works and what does not, be updated on rocky shore ecology and impact studies, identify management needs, develop standard procedures for OPRD management and school group use of rocky intertidal field trip sites. These workshops should be supported by high-level officials in relevant agencies and organizations in order for them to be taken seriously. Such workshops should also be held at times suitable for science teacher attendance, so that those taking rocky shore field trips can attend. Using the above workshops as a vehicle, OPRD, relevant federal agencies, and nonprofits should develop a visitor/school group program to monitor changing use of areas and be alerted to excessive impacts. OPRD, nonprofits involved in intertidal education, and the Oregon Science Teachers Association should establish a formal network to enhance communication between school teachers and rocky intertidal resource managers and promote environmental stewardship and education."
