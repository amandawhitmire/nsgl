11,Abstract:,"Krill meal can be a good partial substitute for fish meal-based commercial diets at colder temperatures (6 deg. C in this study); krill meal enhances feeding activity. For chum salmon fry, feed containing some krill produces better growth, feed efficiency, and survival than all krill feed or feed with no krill. Alaska hatchery operators, many of whom are using commerical feeds developed to rear salmonids in the moderate temperatures of Washington and Oregon, will be interested in the results of this study. Alaska hatcheries release hundreds of millions of pink and chum salmon fry every year."
