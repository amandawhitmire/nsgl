12,Abstract:,"Because of the abundance of Pacific pomfret, its important ecological role in the North Pacific and its potential for sustaining a large commercial fishery, better understanding of the biology and ecology of this species is needed. Based on results of 12 yrs of gillnet cruises by Hokkaido University, information is presented on geographic variations in size distributions, interannual trends in abundance relative to ocean conditions, patchiness of catches in gill nets, age and growth, food habits and parasites, and observations on swimming behavior of Pacific pomfret."
