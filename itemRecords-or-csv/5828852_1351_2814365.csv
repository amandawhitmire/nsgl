18,Abstract:,"Estuaries and coastal wetlands are among the most important ecosystems in the coastal zone, providing goods and services that are vital to human society. The need for protecting, preserving, and restoring these valuable ecosystems was a major factor in passage of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) in 1972. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of state coastal management programs (CMPs) in protection of estuaries and coastal wetlands. This study seeks to determine the extent to which effectiveness can be demonstrated by on- the-ground outcomes of CZM policy implementation. The research involved extensive collaboration with the states. Data collection and state profile development were based on published information, a series of structured interviews with state officials, and unpublished information from reports, permit tracking databases, and other sources. Individual state programs were evaluated to determine: (1) the importance of the issue in the state;(2) the potential effectiveness of the program, based on analysis of the policies, processes and tools used;(3) the on-the- ground outcome effectiveness based on analysis of income indicators; and (4)overall context-based performance. Tidal and nontidal management efforts were evaluated separately for both ecological and legal- institutional reasons. Findings and recommendations are listed. Among the findings were that the issue of protection is widely regarded as important, that most CMPs 'look good on paper' but the outcome measures are more modest, particularly where insufficient data has been acquired. Recommendations are made to standardize performance evaluation, improve nontidal freshwater wetland management, and establish coastal restoration policies."
