12,Abstract:,"The plasma clearance rate (PCR) of radioactivity after a single intracardial injection of 3H-cortisol was elevated during the spring in yearling coho salmon, ""Oncorhynchus kisutch."" Graphical analysis suggested a seasonal correlation between PCR and gill Na/K-ATPase activity; an explanation for this is offered."
