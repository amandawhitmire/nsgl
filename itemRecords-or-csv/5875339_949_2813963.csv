12,Abstract:,"This pilot study looks at communication mechanisms and effectiveness between the commercial fishing and fisheries regulatory communities. The authors assess factors that complicate effective communication, existing and potential communication strategies, how members of both communities perceive their effectiveness, and how these strategies affect the relationship between the communities. It is clear that improving communication between the fishing and management communities will have to take place on many levels, from individual efforts to agency wide initiatives. An appendix provides an overview of suggestions for making communication more effective, both in the short term and long term."
