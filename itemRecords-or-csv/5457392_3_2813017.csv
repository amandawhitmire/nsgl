13,Abstract:,"Oregon was one of the first states to receive a Sea Grant designation. Twenty years have passed and there are many things to look back at with pride. But there is also a good deal happening today and a great deal to look forward to. This publication is a brief overview of Oregon Sea Grant as it is today. Oregon Sea Grant has played a role in the creation of the law program, the Extension/Sea Grant system, the Marine Science Center, and much more. The list of Sea Grant accomplishments is long and these are only vignettes from the larger portrait of Sea Grant activity in Oregon, the Northwest, and the nation. In fact, Oregon Sea Grant reaches the world through its international projects. In its brief history, faced with severe budget pressures, Sea Grant has become an accepted and valued part of the marine community of America. In this program report we offer some of the proof that Sea Grant is becoming an American institution."
