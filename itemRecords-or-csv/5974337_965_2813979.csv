10,Abstract:,"The development of ports in the United States in several instances predates the founding of the Nation. At one time, ports were the primary reason for establishing inland and coastal communities. Today, ports not only play important roles in the development of waterborne commerce but they're also strategic actors in the economic development efforts of a number of States. This publication provides an overview of what the smaller ports do, how they're financed, and how they're governed."
