11,Abstract:,"An interferon-like activity in four different fish cell lines has been induced by treatment with poly I:C, a potent interferon inducer. There was considerable variation in the level of activity induced among these cells; results suggest that t he SSE-5 cell lines would be the cell line of choice to study interferon induction. Differences were also observed in sensitivity of a single virus isolate of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) to the antiviral activity induced in the four cell lines. The fish interferon is capable of protecting fish cells against the cytopathic effects of IHNV infection and should be useful as an immune adjuvant."
