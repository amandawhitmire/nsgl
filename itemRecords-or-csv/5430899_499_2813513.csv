14,Abstract:,"This workshop provided a forum for the candid discussion of seafood quality and the problems associated with attaining and maintaining it in the Pacific Northwest fishing industry. A recent Alaskan study, in which over 100 industry leaders and experts were interviewed, concluded that quality appeared to be the major hurdle facing the seafood industry in the next twenty years. With rapidly increasing sales in seafood due to health concerns over cholesterol, the industry must tackle the huge issue of quality control. This workshop offered a forum in which all segments of the seafood industry could meet, examine different perspectives on the quality issue and explore possible routes by which to proceed.
