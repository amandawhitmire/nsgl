12,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is an important pathogen of certain species of salmonid fish. Detection of IHNV is routinely done by examining hematopoietic tissues or reproductive fluids. The objectives of the study were to determine (1) if virus could be detected in mucus of juvenile salmonids infected with IHNV, (2) if mucus from adult salmonids could be used as a source of virus, and (3) if virus present in the mucus was part of the pathogenesis of IHNV. Results suggested that IHNV detected in mucus resulted from the normal progression of the disease; the integument may be a site of virus replication and a possible portal of entry."
