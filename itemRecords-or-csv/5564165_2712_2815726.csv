11,Abstract:,"Although current dietary recommendations emphasize the consumption of fish, the impact of different species of fish as components of a diet of known fat composition has not been evaluated systematically. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of the consumption of reasonable quantities of chinook salmon, sablefish, and Dover sole as components of a Western diet, on bleeding time, platelet aggregation, and ex vivo production of vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2. Results suggest that certain species of fish when consumed in reasonable amounts as part of a Western diet may cause modestly positive effects on platelet function."
