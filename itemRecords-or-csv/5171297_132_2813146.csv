18,Abstract:,"Salmonid populations in Oregon hatcheries, rivers and lakes have been examined extensively for the presence of viruses pathogenic for these species. Cell culture methods were employed that permitted the isolation of such agents from fish tissues and their identification. Two viruses have been isolated during the course of this investigation. The first of these recovered was found to cause an epizootic among juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) at the Oakridge Salmon Hatchery in 1958. The disease that the virus causes is now known as infectious hematopoietic necrosis (1HN). The second virus found in Oregon's salmonids causes the disease known as infectious pancreatic necrosis (1PN). In 1976 and 1977 a third virus was detected by one of us( M. P-F.) by microscopically examining the erythrocytes of two fish species taken in waters along the Oregon coast. Large particles of hexagonal profile, having the typical appearance of polyhedral virions, were found in the cells of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) and Pacific herring (Clupea harengus pallasi). No virus has been isolated and little is known of its properties. It is referred to as the virus of piscine erythrocytic necrosis, or PEN, and most recently as viral erythrocytic necrosis, or VEN. As soon as the presence of virulent viruses in certain salmonid populations was recognized, it became important to obtain information about the prevalence and distribution of these agents in Oregon waters. It is the purpose of the present report to provide complete information concerning this survey, including the methods used and the results, and to make recommendations​ for hatchery practices and control measures based on the acquired information.
