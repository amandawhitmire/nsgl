7,Abstract:,"Pacific whiting swims in abundance off the north west U.S. coast during much of the year. Until recently, however, the fish was shunned by commercial fishers because its flesh deteriorates quickly after the fish is caught. Although whiting could be processed at sea by modern factory ships/the economic potential of shore-based processing went unrealized. Oregon Sea Grant research and outreach helped develop new harvesting, onboard handling and processing techniques that have overcome the rapid breakdown of whiting flesh."
