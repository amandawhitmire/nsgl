9,Abstract:,"The Oregon Coast Education Program works with teachers and classes to advance the quality and frequency of coastal and watershed education activities in public schools. These education modules were developed to link together existing curriculum and resources that represent some of the best marine and aquatic education activities and practices to support field-based investigations. They are divided into three grade bands: Elementary (grades 3-5), Middle School (grades 6-8), and High School (grades 9-12). Each module is subdivided into three focus areas: Coastal Ecosystems & Ecology; Impacts & Solutions; and Climate Change."
