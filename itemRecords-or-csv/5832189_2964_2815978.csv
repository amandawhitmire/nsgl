14,Abstract:,"Three interferon-​inducible Mx genes have been identified in rainbow trout ""Onchorhynchus mykiss"" and their roles in virus resistance have yet to be determined. In mice, expression of the Mx1 protein is associated with resistance to influenza virus. The purpose of this study was to determine whether resistance/susc​eptibility to IHNV is correlated with a specific Mx mRNA species or restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) pattern. The genomes of distinct rainbow trout families selected the genomes of distinct rainbow trout families selected for different levels of resistance to IHNV were analyzed for Mx RFLP patterns. Fish from each family were also infected with IHNV and after 48 h, the Mx mRNA species were identified in northern blots."
