12,Abstract:,"There is more to coastal-erosion processes than just storm-generated waves attacking the shoreline, although this is generally a major factor. A given episode of erosion is likely in response to the combined effects of high wave energies, increased infragravity or incident swash energies, a rise in the water level due to set-up and possibly a wind-driven storm surge, and the intensification of rip and other nearshore currents. Susceptibility to erosion may also have been increased because of long- or short-term rises in sea level. Man is often a factor in causing or enhancing the coastal erosion, most obvious when jetties are constructed but can also occur with the damming of rivers or offshore dredging of sand sources. Considerable variability in beach erosion in the longshore direction may be caused by a number of factors, including the patterns of offshore bars and nearshore currents."
