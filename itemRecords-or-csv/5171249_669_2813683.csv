11,Abstract:,This report focuses on the Columbia/Snake navigation system and its current and future status in the context of intermodal ocean shipping. It covers one phase of a research program at the University of Idaho to investigate the potential of the Columbia/Snake waterway in the Pacific Northwest export distribution system. The purpose is to look at how developments in intermodal transportation encompassing ocean and inland waterway technologies that occurred in the later 1960's and early 1970's may affect waterborne commerce on the Columbia/Snake navigation system.
