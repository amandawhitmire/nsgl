12,Abstract:,"Because abundance of adult coho salmon is correlated with strength of upwelling that occurs a year earlier and because the number of precocious males returning to hatcheries after only one summer in the ocean is generally an excellent predictor of the production of adult coho, ocean conditions during the first summer in the ocean appear to significantly affect survival of juvenile coho salmon. To evaluate the linkage between ocean productivity and growth of coho salmon during their first summer, the authors compare growth rates, condition, and stomach fullness of marked and unmarked juvenile coho caught in the ocean in years of low survival and low upwelling (1983 and 1984) with those in years of higher survival and higher upwelling (1981, 1982, and 1985). The evidence for size-selective and growth rate-selective mortality in the ocean during these years is also examined."
