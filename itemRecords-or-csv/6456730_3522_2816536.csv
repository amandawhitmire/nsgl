9,Abstract:,"This curriculum uses Ocean Science Systems as pathways to stimulate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) learning to guide students in decision making. Students immerse into STEM through understanding the causes and consequences of a natural disaster such as a tsunami or bioinvasion, learn about their risks and explore choices and consequences of responses and preparation to tsunami hazards. In addition, students engage in critical thinking about the consequences of different responses. The goal is to provide STEM applications through natural phenomena, coastal engineering design and the interaction of human systems as a conduit for teachers to apply, measure and motivate STEM learning. The module includes three activities that address short- and long-term questions about tsunami risk."
