11,Abstract:,"Two methods are recommended for detection of the rickettsia first isolated from Chilean coho salmon in 1989 and demonstrated to be pathogenic for other salmonid species. Either isolation of the rickettsial agent in cell culture or detection in acridine orange (AO) stained tissue smears is an appropriate method for presumptive identification. Following detection with either AO stain or isolation in cell culture, confirmatory identification must be made using serological methods. Although isolations of the rickettsia have been limited in number and recommendations will no doubt be modified with time, the current suggested procedures are detailed here."
