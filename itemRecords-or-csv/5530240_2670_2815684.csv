10,Abstract:,"Under section 8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, federal and coastal state governments share the revenues from oil and gas pools underlying the federal/state boundary three miles offshore. In addition, Congress has fixed a state's share at 27% of all federal revenues from OCS tracts within six nautical miles of shore. States have argued that they need this money to mitigate adverse economic and environmental effects related to the development of OCS oil and gas resources. Representatives from coastal states are justified in using the 8(g) experiences as a stepping stone to the eventual expansion of federal/state revenue sharing to other OCS and EEZ resources, such as hard minerals. The four west coast states should dedicate a % of the future 8(g) and related offshore revenues they receive from the federal government to such interstate activities as mapping the marine boundaries between states, restoring commercial and recreational fisheries, and developing marine educational material."
