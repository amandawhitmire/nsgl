9,Abstract:,"This research explores the barriers that prevent stakeholders from changing their hobby behaviors to help prevent the spread of invasive species in Oregon. Invasive species are increasingly causing economic and ecosystem harm in Oregon. This is among the first studies done on the human dimensions of invasive species. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework, the attitudes, norms and perceived behavioral controls regarding preventative behaviors were elucidated during four focus groups (29 individuals) with individual groupings of gardeners, anglers, hunters and boaters. Findings indicate six belief barriers to changing hobby behaviors. These include 1) the attitude that preventative behaviors, such as using pesticides, may be worse for the environment than invasive species, 2) the attitude that the fight against invasive species is a losing battle, 3) the norm belief that institutions don't care enough to prioritize action on the issue of invasive species, 4) the norm belief that the general public both doesn't know and doesn't care about invasive species, 5) the behavioral control belief that one doesn't know enough about the preventative behaviors to be effective, and 6) the behavioral control belief that preventative behaviors are too difficult to perform. Understanding the beliefs that prevent changes in behavior will help inform the creation of effective statewide invasive species awareness and actions campaigns, such as that being led by the Oregon Invasive Species Council, as well as provide a foundation of research on which to build additional research. Findings suggest that an effective way to engage stakeholders in being part of the solution to invasive species may include addressing social norms by targeting awareness messaging and engagement activities to hobby groups."
