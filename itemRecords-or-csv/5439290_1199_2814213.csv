11,Abstract:,"In 1981-82 Abert Lake had an area of 200 km2, with a mean depth of 2.5 m and a total dissolved salt concentration of 82 g/L. During midsummer 1981, brine shrimp populations showed peak densities of 2-4 ind/L. In 1982, peak abundance occurred in early July and ranged 5-8 ind/L. Assuming a uniform distribution over the lake, estimates of lakewide abundance were (3x10)11 adults with a total biomass of (7x10)6 kg. The potential impact that the 1981-82 commercial shrimp harvest, together with estimated avian consumption, had on the adult population was estimated."
