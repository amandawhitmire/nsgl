11,Abstract:,"Anadromous fish are affected by a diverse array of human activities. Managers must decide what subset of potential actions will achieve stock rebuilding objectives with the least harm to the regional economy. Linking recovery probabilities with the costs of associated scenarios allows the depiction of a cost-â€‹effectiveness frontier, which identifies the least-cost alternatives achieving increasing levels of recovery probability. Results suggest that improvement over current survival levels may be achieved at costs much lower than those of current management."
