10,Abstract:,We plan to show data acquired while working with the GS311 and BI361 classes. These data are being collected to test the hypothesis that extended inquiry based experience can lead to comprehension of macroinvertebra​te sorting in both science and novices students. The students in these classes are sorting and classifying macroinvertebra​tes from benthic core samples. Three surveys are administered to the students to assess understanding and confidence. A concept inventory is also being used to show if concepts are being learned. Our data should show if any increase is observed in the understanding and confidence of the students.
