10,Abstract:,"Governance of the world's marine fisheries is ill-adapted to sustainability. Twenty years after the expansion of exclusive economic zones over most of the continental shelves, fisheries worldwide face problems of stock depletion, declining yields and increasing conflict. Other human activities in the ocean compound the effect. What is wrong? This paper reveals the fundamental weaknesses of fishery governance that contribute to sustainability problems. The author proposes and discusses improvements."
