14,Abstract:,"The 16S rRNA of ""Renibacterium salmoninarum,"" the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease in salmonids, was sequenced by reverse transcriptase to produce a nearly complete sequence (97%) of 1475 nucelotides. Phylogenetic comparions to seventeen genera and signature sequence analysis indicated that ""R. salmoninarum"" was a member of the high G + C Gram-positive eubacterial subdivision although the reported G + C value is only 53%. A phylogenetic tree details the relationship of ""R. salmoninarum"" to ten actinomycetes from diverse environments."
