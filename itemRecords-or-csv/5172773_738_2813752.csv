11,Abstract:,"Estuaries are the natural focal point for many industrial and recreational activities; their uses should be recognized. Ne realize that estuaries are the rearing areas for many marine animals and that land fill and pollution have wiped out many estuaries on the shores of North America. Many life forms and the valuable aesthetics of the remaining estuaries of the Pacific Northwest are in danger. Thus, it is timely to review the problems involved in the preservation and proper utilization of the estuaries in this region. Speaker​s were invited to address themselves to a wide range of subjects -- some of a legal-political nature and others emphasizing estuarine technology . Sessions were devoted to modeling, hydrodynamics, ​ sediment transport, the ecology of estuaries, state and national legal policies and standards affecting developments of estuaries. It was demonstrated that very competent talent exists in the Pacific Northwest in governmental organizations, educational institutions, industry, and consulting firms to effectively handle technical problems concerning development and preservation of estuaries, However, the interactions between local groups and governmental groups at all levels needs to continue in order to effect needed standards and regulations to reduce the complex conflicts of use of the coastal zone. On the following pages appear the texts of papers delivered by the invited speakers to this first Technical Conference on Estuaries of the Pacific Northwest."
