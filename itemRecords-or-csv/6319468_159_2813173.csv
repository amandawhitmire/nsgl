11,Abstract:,"This report summarizes the presentations and discussions at the Regional Gravel Initiative Workshop. The Workshop was designed and conducted by the Institute for Natural Resources (INR) and Oregon Sea Grant (Sea Grant) on behalf of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), the Oregon Department of State Lands (DSL) and the Oregon Concrete and Aggregate Producers Association to support and further the work of the Regional Gravel Initiative (RGI). The Workshop centered on a USGS report presented by Dr. Jim O'Connor and two scientific panels. The geomorphology panel was composed of Dr. Brian Cluer (NMFS), Dr. Pete Klingeman (OSU Department of Civil Engineering), Chris Lidstone (Lidstone and Associates) and Dr. Desiree Tullos (OSU Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering). The biological panel was composed of Todd Confer (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife), Dennis Halligan (Stillwater Sciences), Jim Waldvogel (Sea Grant), and Chuck Wheeler (NMFS). The report was prepared by Gail L. Achterman of the Institute for Natural Resources based upon notes taken by Amy Ewing, INR, Megan Kleibacker, Sea Grant, and several agency staff members who shared their notes. In the portions presented in conversational format, the text represents summary - rather than exact - quotations. For convenience moving forward, the report incorporates the discussion questions developed for the workshop by the RGI Technical Team. The questions and other material from the discussion question paper are italicized in the report."
