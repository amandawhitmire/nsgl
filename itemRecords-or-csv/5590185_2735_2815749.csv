13,Abstract:,"Our investigations of the cytotoxic and antimicrobial peptide chemistry of the Caribbean cyanobacterium, ""Hormothamnion enteromorphoide​s"" is an exclusively marine cyanobacterium which grows abundantly in the shallow coastal waters off Northern Puerto Rico, although it has an overall pantropical distribution. A complex series of peptide natural products were initially discovered as a result of bioassay guided fractionation efforts following the pronounced gram + antimicrobial activity observed in the crude lipid extract. The complete structure elucidation of the most lipophilic of these, hormothamnin A, which is also the most abundant, has been ahcallenging problem; the results of these efforts are reported here."
