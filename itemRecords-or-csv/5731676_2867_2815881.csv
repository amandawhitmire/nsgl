14,Abstract:,"Pacific whiting is available off the U.S. West Coast for about six months each year. A plan to extend the period of shore-based surimi production from whiting was investigated. Headed/gutted fish, and minced stabilized with cryoprotectantsâ€‹, were frozen, stored for up to six months, then processed into surimi. Measurements of texture and color were compared with those for a surimi control sample. Frozen mince stabilized with sucrose resulted in production of good quality surimi. Pilot scale yield and freezing rate studies indicated the potential feasibility of commercial- scale production."
