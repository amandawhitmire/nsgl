12,Abstract:,"Biological invasions are becoming a serious problem worldwide. Aquatic invasive species can be stopped, but only through early detection and a quick response. This educational color DVD gives an overview of the problem and provides identification and natural history information about one potential Northwest threat, the Chinese mitten crab. This video is a must-see for aquatic monitoring staff and volunteers, field educators, aquaculture operators, and others who spend time in lakes, rivers, and estuaries."
