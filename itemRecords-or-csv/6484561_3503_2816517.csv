12,Abstract:,"Transmission dynamics of the actinospore stage of Ceratomyxa shasta to the salmonid host were investigated under field and laboratory conditions. The number of parasites transmitted and the transmission rate were compared between 2 different exposure durations and also among different water velocities, by means of field exposures. Under laboratory conditions, the number of parasites transmitted and the transmission rates were compared across a broader range of water velocities and also at different water temperatures. Transmission rate was not constant over time as the number of parasites transmitted increased non-linearly between the 2 exposure durations. Transmission was also inversely related to water velocity and there was a threshold to transmission between 0*2-​0*3ms−1. Lastly, transmission rate increased with water temperature up to 18 deg. C then decreased at 23 deg. C. These experiments provide a range of values of transmission that will be incorporated into an epidemiological model to simulate the effectiveness of different management strategies. Additionally, these experiments provided novel information on the effects of environmental conditions (i.e. water velocity and water temperature) on the transmission dynamics between the salmonid host and the actinospore stage."
