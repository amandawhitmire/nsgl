11,Abstract:,An eigenfunction expansion complete to second order is presented for the two-dimensional wave motion forced by a sinusoidally moving generic wavemaker. A time-dependent second-order evanescent interaction potential and time-â€‹independent potential required to satisfy boundary conditions exactly are examined in detail. The amplitude of the second-order free wave computed by including the evanescent interaction potential compares favorably with previously published values based on a complete Lagrangian solution. The theoretical results for the amplitude of the second-order free wave are in reasonable agreement with experimental data.
