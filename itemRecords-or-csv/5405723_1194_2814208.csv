10,Abstract:,"A minute bivalve, ""Adontorhina sphaericosa"" Scott, spec. nov. (Thyasiridae), is described from Boca de Quadra, Alaska. The new species occurs from 95 to 330 m in two fjords in southeast Alaska, at 165 m in British Columbia, and from 204 to 458 m on the continental slope of Oregon. The morphologic relationship and familial placement of three thyasirids, ""Adontorhina, Axinulus,"" and ""Leptaxinus"", are discussed. A revised description and new records of ""Adontorhina cyclia"" are reported, including a major northern range extension to the Bering Sea, Alaska. The gross anatomy for both species of ""Adontorhina"" is described and illustrated."
