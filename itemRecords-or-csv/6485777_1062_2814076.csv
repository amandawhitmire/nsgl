10,Abstract:,"Oregon Sea Grant's Strategic Plan for 2014-2017 identifies the program's goals and strategies for addressing key issues important to Oregonians, the region, and the nation. This plan also identifies the metrics we will use to track our progress toward these goals. The process of developing and publishing a strategic plan helps us focus and unify our thinking and communicate our priorities to our many partners and stakeholders. We look to this document to guide decision-making and resource allocations toward improving the health and well-being of Oregon's people, economy, and environment."
