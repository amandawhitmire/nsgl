13,Abstract:,"The 1982-83 El Nino was an unusually intense atmospheric and oceanic phenomenon that produced severe erosion along much of the U.S. Pacific coast. Effects persist even though several years have passed. For example, after many years with minimal erosion, Netarts Spit has become an area of major beach loss; the chief impact has been at Cape Lookout State Park, a popular recreation site. During the El Nino years, sand was transported northward along the beach fronting Netarts Spit and was then swept into Netarts Bay, permanently removing sand from the nearshore zone and leaving the beach-sand volume depleted. As a result, the beach no longer buffers the parklands from wave-erosion processes. Potential solutions to the erosion problem are discussed."
