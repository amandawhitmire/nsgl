12,Abstract:,"This research postulates a conceptual framework to understand natural hazard preparedness that takes into account the learning theory of Paulo Freire operationalized by Rossatto (2005) through the concept of transformative optimism. It is proposed that transformative optimism beliefs and behaviors should be nurtured to go beyond the current resilient paradigm in natural hazard preparedness, to not only resist the future impacts of natural hazards; but to strengthen the social capital of each community to create new means to minimize such impacts in the long-term, for the current, and future generations."
