10,Abstract:,"This paper presents the results of an econometric investigation of the demand for recreational boat moorage. The demand model assumes that individuals minimize the cost of producing the services derived from recreational boating. This minimization presents the boat owner with a cost function that is incorporated into the budget constraint. The resultant demand functions show that the demand for moorage depends on variables which affect the cost of boating (e.g., the price of moorage, the cost of travel between the owner's residence and the moorage site), variables which affect owner preferences for boating (e.g., fishing activity), and variables which affect cost and preferences (e.g., location of residence). The most important findings of the study are (a) the demand for moorage is price-elastic, (b) the demands for moorage at specific locations are more elastic than the aggregate demand along the entire Oregon coast, and (c) the absolute responsiveness of demand to unit changes in moorage rates is about the same at alternative locations."
