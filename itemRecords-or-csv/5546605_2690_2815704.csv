12,Abstract:,"Cortisol is the primary corticosteroid hormone produced by the interrenal tissue of most teleosts. Many studies have demonstrated its importance in the osmoregulatory processes of various fishes. Changes in salinity evoke changes in the plasma concentration and clearance of cortisol from the blood of salmonids. Cortisol, in turn, may affect water and electrolyte exchange in tissues of the gill, gut, kidney, urinary bladder, and muscle, thus influencing the concentration of electrolytes in the blood and urine. The purpose of this study was to determine if treatment of juvenile coho salmon in freshwater with exogenous cortisol affected plasma concentrations of Na+, K+, T3, and T4, and muscle water content, before and after entry into seawater. The results suggest that cortisol may modify osmoregulatory processes and thyroid hormone activity during smoltification and acclimation to seawater in yearling coho salmon."
