14,Abstract:,"The authors have determined the complete coding sequences for the glycoprotein (G) genes from two rhabdoviruses that infect warm water aquatic animals, the snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV) and rhabdovirus of penaeid shrimp (RPS). Surprisingly, the G nucleotide sequence from RPS, a virus which has been isolated from diseased shrimp in Hawaii on numerous occasions was over 99% identical to the G nucleotide sequence from spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), a fish virus from Europe and Asia, This is the first report of SVCV isolation outside of Europe and Asia, and it is also the first report of SVCV infecting a non- vertebrate species. The G gene from SHRV was most closely related to the G genes from the three Novirhabdovirus​es, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), and hirame rhabdovirus (HIRRV). Phylogenetic analysis using the amino acid sequence from rhabdovirus G genes indicated that SHRV should be classified within the Novirhabdovirus genus. Finally, the SHRV-G gene was successfully expressed in mammalian cells under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, establishing that it can potentially be used in the production of pseudotyped retroviruses designed to infect fish."
