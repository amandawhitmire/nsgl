12,Abstract:,"Along the coast of northwestern North America during the past two hundred years, dikes and levees have been built to drain tidal wetlands, both to convert them into agricultural and to protect flood-prone areas. To control the flow of upland water into diked estuarine zones or river reaches and to keep estuarine waters from moving upstream, structures known as tide boxes are used. A flood box may be simple or complex, but it involves a culvert running through the dike wall. In all cases, gates, known as tide gates, are attached to the discharge end of the culverts to control the flow of water. The negative ecological consequences of diking and regulating estuarine wetlands with flood boxes and tides gates have received little attention. This report addresses some critical gaps in our knowledge. It explains the characteristics of traditional tide gate designs, explains the environmental effects of dikes and tide gates, and identifies areas in which more research is necessary."
