10,Abstract:,"In the 30 years between 1953 and 1983, the federal government received over $68 billion from outer continental shelf (OCS) oil and gas leases without sharing any with the adjacent coastal states. This fact alone perhaps explains why federal-state relations in the 1980s with respect to OCS oil and gas development generally have been adversarial in nature, despite elaborate statutory provisions for consultation between Department of the Interior and affected coastal states. Further, while the greatest share of the direct benefits of this development accrues to the federal government and the oil company lessees, many of its burdens are borne by state and local governments. Given this disparity and the relative lack of authority of local governments over the pace and scope of offshore resource development, it is not surprising to find state and local governments litigating to protect their interests. Recent discoveries of exploitable minerals within the U.S. 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone, coupled with the DOI's assumption of authority over them, suggest that this adversarial relationship will extend to development of hard minerals as well."
