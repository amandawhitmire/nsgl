12,Abstract:,"Chitosan has been proposed as a natural coagulating agent to solve wastewater problems. The hypothesis in this research is that chitosan complexes with natural polyanions are more effective than chitosan alone, particularly in recovering low concentration proteins from food processing wastewater. Objectives were (1) to form complexes of chitosan with natural polyanions to be added to (ex situ) or prepared in (in situ) the wastewater stream for treating cheese whey and surimi wastewater, and (2) to deduce the chitosan-​polyanion ex situ and in situ complexation mechanisms and a mechanistic model to understand protein adsorption on these complexes."
