It provides a series of reports on the laws and institutions affecting the Columbia River's anadromous fishery and are designed to serve two purposes. First, as a mechanism to report to the public the results of NRLI's more detailed legal analyses. Second, through the inclusion in each issue of ""Fish Law Briefs"" providing a format in which the pubic may be apprised of the numerous on-going developments impacting upon the Columbia's salmon and steelhead. Some cover article/topics of interest include: The Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act: A preliminary analysis; Indian Treaty Fishing Rights and Protection of the Environment; Implementing the Regional Power Act: An analysis of some pressing issues; Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) proposes draft power contracts that compromise fish and wildlife; The salmon and steelhead enhancement Act of 1980: Laudable objectives, little funding; Fish and wildlife program recommendations submitted to regional council."
