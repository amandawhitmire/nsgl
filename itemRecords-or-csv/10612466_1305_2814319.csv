15,Abstract:,"This research report is a companion to the report of the project process and outcomes, Regional Framework for Climate Adaptation: Clatsop and Tillamook Counties. The Regional Framework project, conducted from 2013 to early 2015, built on the foundation of Oregon’s state-level Climate Change Adaptation Framework, produced in 2010. With that foundation, and with an apparent interest on the part of state, federal, and local officials in exploring how the state framework might be applicable at a regional scale, the Regional Framework project captured the attention of 123 participants, 84 of whom participated in one or more of the project’s three workshops, described in detail in this report. The project also claimed the attention of a cadre of staff and affiliates of Oregon Sea Grant, whose research report this is. All but one of the authors of this report were directly involved in project activities, so readers should recognize this report as a perspective on the project rather than an independent evaluation of it."
