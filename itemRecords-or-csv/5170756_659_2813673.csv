12,Abstract:,"This report presents the findings of a sediment analysis program formulated to determine the flushing potential of various shaped small boat basins. Chemic​al tests regarding volatile solids, Kjeldahl nitrogen, grease and oil, and sulfides were performed with the results compared to established sediment quality criteria. It is felt that this method of research using sediments in describing a hydraulic system, has a potential for further use in examining marina flushing ability. Suggestions for future work are proposed."
