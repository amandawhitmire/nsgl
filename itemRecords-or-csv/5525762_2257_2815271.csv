11,Abstract:,"The convergence of the Juan de Fuca Plate with the North American Plate produces several manifestations on the seafloor that indicate expulsion of fluids from accreted sediments of the Oregon margin. Among these manifestations are authigenic carbonate deposits; carbonate slabs, crusts, and chimneys occur within several of the active vent sites on the lower slope. The objectives of this study are (1) to document and summarize their occurrence in relation to geologic structure and stratigraphy; (2) to determine their morphological, chemical, mineralogical, and isotopic characteristics​; (3) to describe the plumbing network of the carbonate structures and their relationship to probable fluid conduits, and (4) to infer the nature and source of fluids whose expulsion at the seafloor builds up these carbonate structures."
