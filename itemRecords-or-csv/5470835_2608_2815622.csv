11,Abstract:,"It has been 35 years since the first field measurements of sand transport rates along beaches permitted correlations with the causative wave conditions. The list of published field studies now includes 16 beach locations, yielding data for various types of correlations between sand transport rates, the wave conditions, and longshore current magnitudes. Given the considerable amount of accumulated data from a variety of beach locations, the question arises as to whether we can now detect environmental controls on the resulting sediment transport rates, that is, factors beyond the direct dependence on the wave power and angle of wave breaking. Various dependencies have been suggested including a simple correlation with the beach sediment grain size or settling velocity, the beach slope, or more complex combinations of various environmental parameters. The objective of this study is to reexamine those suggested correlations to determine whether improved predictions of longshore sediment transport rates are possible if we include considerations of such environmental factors."
