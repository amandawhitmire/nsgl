13,Abstract:,"From funding imaginative research to advancing the science and art of helping people learn, Oregon Sea Grant is taking risks and making commitments - hence the title of the program report. We like to think that this package [DVD with booklet] reflects that risk-taking, too. Most annual reports aren't read cover to cover. Readers browse, looking for items that interest them already or catch them now. But most reports are dull - they may look slick but they don't communicate the essence of the organization. They seem dreamed up by a consultant. We decided to do something different - something to reflect our dynamic organization and its creative approaches to challenges. So herewith our program report in booklet form - short, sweet, varied - and a companion DVD. The videos on the DVD complement the stories in the booklet, offering more depth, more perspective, and more a sense of our reality, in person. Innovative research, Extension, communications, and education, that's Oregon Sea Grant today, taking risks, making commitments."
