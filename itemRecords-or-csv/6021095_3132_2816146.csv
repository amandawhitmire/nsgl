9,Abstract:,"The marine cyanobacterium ""Lyngbya majuscaula"" has proven to be extraordinarily rich in bioactive secondary metabolites. This dissertation describes the chemistry of ""L. majuscula"" collected from Grenada, Fiji and Papua New Guinea, and the biosyntheses of two L. majuscula metabolites, curacin A and barbamide. The chemical studies with a Grenada collection of L. majuscula revealed three new metabolites, grenadadiene, debromogrenadad​iene and grenadamide. These three compounds are the only reported cyclopropyl-​containing fatty acids from Lyngbya species. The chemistry of a mixed assemblage of L. majusculal Schizothrix species from Fiji was investigated and shown to contain two novel depsipeptides, yanucamides A and B. Both compounds possessed the unique 2,2- dimethyl-​3-​hydroxy-​7-​ictynoic acid, a unit that has only been described in the structures of kulolide-1 and kulokainalide-​1, metabolites from the marine mollusk ""Philinopsis speciosa"". Chemical investigation of the highly brine shrimp toxic extract of Papua New Guinea collection of L. majuscula led to the isolation of the previously described cytotoxins, curacins A and D., Upon further investigation of the same extract, two new depsipeptides, clairamide and carliamide, were discoverd. Clairamide contains 3-amino-2- methyl-​pentanoic acid, a component unique to cyanobacterial metabolites, while carliamide possesses the 3-​amino-​2-​methyl-​7-​ octynoic acid, unit that has only been found in the structure of onchidin A, a metabolite from the marine mollusk Onchidium sp. Biosynthetic investigations of barbamide, a unique trichloromethyl-​ containing metabolite, were carried with the cultured L. majuscula. Results from the feeding experiments have established the biosynthetic units of the compound. In addition, isotope- incorporation studies also revealed the barbamide biosynthesis involves chlorination that exclusively occurs at the unactivated pro-S methyl group of leucine. The biosynthesis of curacin A was also examined. Stable isotope feeding experiments have illustrated the cysteine-​initiated (or a thiazoline acyl CoA-initiated) polyketide chain assembly of curacin A with C17 and OCH3 arising from methionine. Moreover, the labeling pattern of acetate at C18- C22 or curacin A is consistent with the five-baron unit deriving from a branded triketide-​derived precursor of isopentyl diphosphate (IPP)/dimethyla​llyl diphosphate (DMAPP)."
