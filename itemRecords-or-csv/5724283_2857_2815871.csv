12,Abstract:,"This report describes the development of a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detecting ""Piscirickettsi​a salmonis"" genomic DNA from cultured fish cells and the tissues of infected fish. This assay proved to be both specific and sensitive. Two additional PCR primers were developed that differentiated between ""P. salmonis"" isolate EM-90 and the other 4 isolates of ""P. salmonis"" examined in this study."
