15,Abstract:,"Remotely sensed lidar and in situ beach profile data are analyzed to quantify interannual to decadal foredune evolution in a U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) littoral cell. Significant regional variability exists in both foredune geomorphology and the remarkable rates of coastal change that occurred following the major E1 Nino winter of 1997/1998. Beaches in the region prograded at rates as high as 5 m/yr between 1997 and 2010 while the dune fields accumulated sand at an average rate of approximately 7 m3/m/yr. Along the 40 km Long Beach Peninsula, just north of the mouth of the Columbia River, this rate of accumulation resulted in about 300,000 m3/yr for the study period (summing to ~4 million cubic meters of new dune material). Alongshore gradients exist in both the physical (e.g. sediment supply) and ecological variables (e.g. % cover of exotic beach grass species) thought responsible for foredune evolution in the region. These gradients allow us to test hypotheses regarding the relative role of physical versus ecological controls on interannual-to decadal-scale foredune evolution."
