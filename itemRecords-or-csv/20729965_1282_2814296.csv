13,Abstract:,"Every summer, Oregon Sea Grant places high-caliber junior and senior undergraduates from around the U.S. with Oregon-based federal and state agencies and nongovernmental organizations for paid, 10-week internships. Students are assigned to a specific project under a mentor. They can assist their mentors with fieldwork, lab work, analysis, research, policy development and public engagement efforts."
