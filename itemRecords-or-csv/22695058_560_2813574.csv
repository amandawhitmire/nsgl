12,Abstract:,"The reproductive success of common murres at Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area varies from year to year. Students will learn how researchers monitor seabird populations and explore data to determine how seabird reproductive success is connected to environmental conditions and trophic relationships. ​Learning Goals: Students in grade levels 11-12 will learn the following: • Reproductive success of organisms can vary from year to year. • Long term data collection provides opportunities to record patterns and detect anomalies. • Reproductive success can be connected to environmental conditions. Lea​rning Objectives: Students will be able to: 1. Identify physical and behavioral adaptations of common murres that contribute to their reproductive success, 2. Use data to describe changes in murre reproductive success at a study site over different years, and 3. Use evidence to suggest possible contributing factors to fluctuations in murre reproductive success."
