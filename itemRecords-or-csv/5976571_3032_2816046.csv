11,Abstract:,"The Stock Synthesis program has been widely used in the Pacific U.S. for assessing groundfish stocks. A major strength is its ability to accommodate multiple input data sources having different degrees of uncertainty. For example, the program can simultaneously analyze data on catch biomass, age composition, stock abundance, and fishing effort, which are likely to be subject to different levels and types of error. Also, the Stock Synthesis results are probably sensitive to biological traits of the fish (e.g., longevity and growth), characteristics of the fishery (e.g., exploitation rate and selection pattern), and the levels of observation error in the input data series. Determining the impact of these factors on the accuracy of Stock Synthesis estimates should help users understand the model's performance and identify which input data are most in need of improvement. In this study, the authors used Monte Carlo simulation to determine the impacts of input data measurement errors and stock characteristics on the bias and precision of Stock Synthesis estimates."
