10,Abstract:,"Oregon has been a leader in developing and implementing effective regulatory programs to protect and preserve wetlands. In response to continued wetland losses and conversions, this report outlines a nonregulatory wetland restoration strategy based on public-private partnership. Ten recommendations and 33 suggested implementation actions aim at improving coordination among governmental and nongovernmental programs, providing better assessment tools, and improving technical assistance to land owners."
