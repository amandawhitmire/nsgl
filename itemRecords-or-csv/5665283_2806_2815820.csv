14,Abstract:,"""Flexibacter psychrophilus"" (=""Cytophaga psychrophila""), the causative agent of bacterial cold-water disease of salmonids, is a frequently encountered but poorly understood fish pathogen which has its salmon. An understanding of ""F. psychrophilus"" proteases is needed to investigate the role of these enzymes in pathogenicity. In this study, researchers identified extracellular proteases produced by ""F. psychrophilus"", assessed variation in protease production that occurs as a factor of culture age, and examined the variability of protease production among a collection of ""F. psychrophilus"" isolates."
