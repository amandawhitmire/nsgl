11,Abstract:,"Previous studies of the areal distribution and concentrations of the heavy mineral and metal deposits (so-called black sand placer deposits) of the Oregon beaches and the southern Oregon coastal marine terraces show that there is considerable resource potential for these deposits. Because of its proximity to coastal rivers and terrace deposits, the adjacent continental shelf is believed to contain similar placer deposits that formed during the multiple transgressions and regressions of sea level during the past several hundred thousand years. The purpose of this paper is to define the probable locations of heavy mineral and metals concentrations on the southern Oregon continental shelf and relate them to their possible analogues in the uplifted coastal terrace placer deposits."
