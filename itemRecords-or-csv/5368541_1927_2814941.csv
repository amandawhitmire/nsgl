12,Abstract:,disease;bacteri​a
13,,"Rainbow trout were infected with ""Vibrio anguillarum"", sampled, and fixed for histological examination; progression of the infection and fate of the invading pathogen were documented. The bacterium was initially sequestered in the spleen, followed by proliferation into the kidney. Death resulted from bacteremia with most tissues of the fish septic. Extensive necrosis of kidney, spleen, posterior intestine and liver was observed. The gills were congested with microorganisms and the epithelial cells destroyed. Extracellular bacterial antigen was observed in the musculature, kidney, liver, intestine and spleen. No phagocytosis by macrophages was observed."
