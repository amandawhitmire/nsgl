11,Abstract:,"Albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) is one of several commercially important species of tuna. Each year from July. into early October, albacore typically are available in the waters off the Pacific Northwest. Despite the commercial importance of albacore, little is known about the complex oceanographic factors which determine their abundance and distribution. A need exists to learn more about albacore in relation to their ocean environment. Primarily using logbook data contributed by fishermen, this study will compare albacore catches with selected ocean conditions. 'The purposes of the study are to describe the patterns of albacore catches and sea-surface temperatures which did exist during 1969, to interpret albac​ore catches in terms of sea-surface and other ocean conditions, to see if quantitative relationships can be established, and to indicate some of the further work which needs to be done. The study is limited to troll-caught albacore taken during the summer of 1969."
