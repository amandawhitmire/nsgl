10,Abstract:,"Use this comprehensive species module for an in-depth understanding of hydrilla and Brazilian elodea. Modules include a comprehensive species guide, a species-​at-​a-​glance fact sheet, a related lesson plan, suggested activies, comprehension questions, and videos and related on-line resources. Hydrilla and Brazilian elodea are invasive aquatic plants that occupy freshwater habitats. While hydrilla is native to Asia, Africa, and eastern Australia, and Brazilian elodea is native to South America, both plants are invasive to North America. Because these plants are related and both have pointed green leaves that whorl up the length of the stem, they may be difficult to distinguish at first glance."
