14,Abstract:,"Oregon is nationally known for its bountiful natural resources and conservation-​minded approach to land use development. However, recent rapid population growth has challenged the ability of many communities to keep up with development pressures without jeopardizing the long-term health of their local environment. In response to this need, the watershed education program of Oregon Sea Grant (OSG) conducted workshops in three Oregon communities (Portland, Grants Pass, and Brookings) to determine what these communities need to better protect their natural resources while accommodating growth. ""Barriers and Opportunities for Low Impact Development"" presents the outcomes of those workshops and offers suggestions for helping communities engage in their own low impact development planning."
