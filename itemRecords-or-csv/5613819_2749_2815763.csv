11,Abstract:,"The role of bacteria as beneficial or harmful agents in the culture of bivalve larvae has been the subject of many investigations. High bacterial densities in cultures of bivalve larvae are generally considered to be deleterious to the larvae and even innocuous bacteria in large numbers have been reported to depress the rate of algal ingestion. In contrast, bacteria have also been implicated as a food source for bivalve larvae or as improving the growth of larvae fed on algae. In this study, axenic larval ""Crassostrea gigas"", obtained without the use of antibiotics, were used in a series of experiments meant to reveal whether selected strains of marine bacteria can consistently improve the survival and growth of algal-fed oyster larvae."
