8,Abstract:,"Congress has mandated that all researchers who receive federal funds from NOAA's Office of Sea Grant must publish research results and distribute them to as wide an audience as possible. In addition, these results must be reported to the federal government, which maintains a library of all Sea Grant-funded publications at the University of Rhode Island. As the Office of Sea Grant says, if a work isn't listed with the library, ""it isn't a Sea Grant publication."" That is, neither the investigator nor the Sea Grant program that supported the project gets credit for the publication, and, thus, the investigator's research appears less productive than it is. It is one of the functions of Oregon Sea Grant Communications to help your project be as productive as possible. To support your work, we pay a portion of the page charges for articles published in a refereed journal, and we buy reprints of articles you publish in journals and trade magazines. When appropriate, we publish your research ourselves. In the following pages, we discuss how you can meet the publication requirements of the Office of Sea Grant as easily and efficiently as possible."
