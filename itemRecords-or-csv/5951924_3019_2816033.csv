18,Abstract:,"Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) catalyzes the hydrolysis of bioactive fatty acid amides and esters such as the endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligands, anandamide (""N- arachidonoyl-​ethanolamine) and 2-​arachidonoylgly​cerol, and the putative sleep inducing factors ""cis""-​9-​octadecenoamide (oleamide). Most FAAH blockers developed to date also inhibit cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and/or bind to the CB1 cannabinoid receptor subtype. Here we report the finding of four novel FAAH inhibitors, two of which, malhamensilipin A and grenadadiene, were screened out of a series of thirty-two different algal natural products, and two others arachidonoyleth​ylene glycol (AEG) and arachidonoyl-​serotonin (AA-5-HT) were selected out of five artificially functionalized polyunsaturated fatty acids. When using FAAH preparations from mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells and [14 C]anandamdie as a substate, the IC 50s for these compounds ranging from 12.0 to 26 mu M, the most active compound being AA-5-HT. This substance was also active on FAAH from rate basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells (IC 50 � 5.6 mu M), and inhibited [14C]anandamide hydrolysis by both N18TG2 and RBL-2H3 intact cells without affecting [14 C]anandamide uptake. While AEG behaved as a competitive inhibitor and was hydrolyzed to arachidonic acid (AA)by FAAH preparations, AA-5-HT was resistant to FAH-catalyzed hydrolysis and behaved as a tight-binding, albeit non-covalent, mixed inhibitor. AA-5-HT did not interfere with cPLA 2-mediated, ionomycin or antigen- induced release of [3 H]AA from RBL-2H3 cells, nor with CPLA2 activity in cell-free experiments. Finally, AA-5-HT did not activate CB1 cannabinoid receptors since it acted as a very week ligand in in vitro binding assays, and, at 10-15 mg/kg body weight, it was not active in the 'open field', 'hot plate' and rectal hypothermia tests carried out in mice. Conversely AEG behaved as a cannabimimetic substance in these tests as well as in the 'ring' immobility test where AA-5-HT was also active. AA-5-HT is the first FAAH inhibitor reported to date which is inactive both against cPLA2 and at CB1 rectors, whereas AEG represents a new type of cannabinoid receptor agonist."
