11,Abstract:,"This document is a summary of the 2016 Annual Meeting of the West Coast Regional Planning Body (RPB) on October 26-27 in Portland, Oregon. Included in this summary are the meeting agenda, presentation slides and condensed transcripts of discussion between RPB members as well as public comments received. Highlights of the meeting included focus on defining the regional goals and functions for the RPB, as well as updates on emerging sub-regional dialogs around ocean planning. Data-​sharing and coordination was a key theme throughout, with presentations from the West Coast Ocean Data Portal and an update on a nascent regional baseline ocean assessment inventory emphasizing the important role of information-​sharing. Key next steps of the meeting included continued development of the RPB’s work plan, emphasizing the importance of effective data-sharing and coordination in the region, initiation and support of sub-regional dialogs for ocean planning that build around existing efforts, and transparent, efficient regional collaboration between tribal, state and federal comanagers along the West Coast. Themes from public comment received at the meeting emphasized the need for increased outreach in the region to understand the role of the RPB, the importance of including a wide range of stakeholders to identify the best role for the RPB’s efforts, recognizing the important link to fisheries issues, and the need for transparency, among others."
