11,Abstract:,"The state of Oregon was involved in establishing a system of no-take marine reserves in its Territorial Sea since 2007. This process included the public in order to engage and involve them with hopes of garnering more support for the establishment of reserves. The inclusion of the public therefore required a broad dissemination of science and policy information integral to the process. To address this need, the Department of Land Conservation and Development funded the creation of two products: a website and a multimedia annotated bibliography of temperate marine reserve science comparable to Oregon. For this project, the perceived success of the website was investigated through download statistics and monthly server logs. From this, I was able to draw conclusions on the general interest of the public in the Oregon marine reserve public policy process and provide insight to others on how to use a similar product to help inform or guide a similar public policy process. The multimedia annotated bibliography was created to be a unique, user-friendly and neutral way of presenting scientific information to the public so that they may draw their own conclusions of protected area science comparable to Oregon. Additionally, a table highlighting similarities of marine protected area study locations to Oregon characteristics was created. Overall, these two Internet based tools were developed to help involve and engage the public in the Oregon marine reserve process and the results and conclusions of this project are intended to help inform the next stages of Oregon's public marine reserve process, as well as serve as a model for other citizens, agencies, scientists or decision-makers involved in a similar public policy process."
