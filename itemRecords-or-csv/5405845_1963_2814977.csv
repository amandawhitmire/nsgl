11,Abstract:,"For some time, fishery economists have attempted to (1) understand resource use under conditions of open access and (2) devise prescriptions for improved resource use under the notion of social optimality. Much more effort has been given to the latter. In this paper the authors argue for a reallocation of effort. To support their position they first contend that (1) there is much we do not know about resource allocation under conditions of open access, (2) the socially optimal resource use in a fishery can be neither identified conceptually nor specified in practice, in part because of an inability to treat entrepreneurshi​p explicitly, and (3) fisheries management is, itself, an entrepreneurial act--which economists are better suited to study than to practice. Portions of the argument are illustrated by looking at the Columbia River salmon fishery; a less normative view of fisheries economics than is currently in vogue is proposed."
