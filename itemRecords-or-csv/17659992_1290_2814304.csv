12,Abstract:,"This video shows educators how to teach students to test water quality using a kit with equipment made by LaMotte. The kit is one of several that educators can borrow from StreamWebs, a program administered by Oregon Sea Grant. StreamWebs provides educators with field equipment, data sheets, lesson plans and training so they can teach students how to collect data about the health of waterways. It also provides an online database where students can enter and analyze the information they gathered."
