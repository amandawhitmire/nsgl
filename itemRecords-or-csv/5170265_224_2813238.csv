11,Abstract:,"This report analyzes some of the linkages between economic growth and environmental change in a rural community. Recently developed methodology for estimating induced as well as direct environmental change from a new industry is applied to a current development issue on the Oregon coast . Some extensions of the methodology were developed to assist in long-​range planning. Linear programming was used to trace environmental consequences of alternative economic growth patterns. Total change from new industry (in this case, a new aluminum plant in Warrenton, Oregon) is shown to depend not only on the relation of the new industry to the environment but also on the impact of the new industry on the local economy and the feedback from the local economy's total expansion back to the environment."
