10,Abstract:,"A cliche of fishery management is that we are managing people, not fish. If achieving the objectives of the Magnuson-​Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires managing people, a critical intervention point for improving management effectiveness is where the involvement of people is the greatest - the regional fishery management councils. The regional fishery management council system is under strain. Since the inception of federal fishery management in 1977, fisheries have undergone development and growth, stress and decline. Management problems have been caused by the race for fish, a short- term perspective, an over-investment in fishing capital and an under-​investment in the information base of management. Pressures for improving management performance are growing, evidenced in part by the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act and by the large number of lawsuits contesting federal management decisions (Botsford et al 1997; Restrepo et al. 1998; Ecosystems Principles Advisory Panel 1999; Heinz Center 2000; National Academy of Public Administration 2002.) In failing to address the race for fish, the problem of overcapacity, and the need to manage for long-term productivity, management through the regional council system has become increasingly complex and costly. Losses in biological and economic productivity have required more complicated regulations, expanded requirements for information, and created more conflicts among user groups. In turn, these factors have increased management costs while undermining management legitimacy and effectiveness (Hanna 1997; 1998). The Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) introduced much stricter standards for the protection of fish populations and their habitat. But the SFA did little to address the fundamental economic problems that continue to plague fisheries. Fishery management under the council system has been conducted, for the most part, in avoidance of the fundamental economic problems facing fisheries. Many fisheries are managed under regulations that still promote a race for fish, with incentives that are incompatible with long-term sustainability. Fisheries are almost universally overcapitalized​. Economic data and analysis are inadequate to the information required. Management costs are high. Each of these problems diminishes the effectiveness of management (Iudicello et al 1999; Heinz Center 2000.)"
