12,Abstract:,"In 2008, Oregon Sea Grant (OSG) was awarded a NOAA Environmental Literacy grant to install, test, and develop evaluation rubrics for a Magic Planet spherical display system (http://www.glo​balimagination.​ com/ ). The Magic Planet is a sphere with an internal projection system that allows for spherical projection of earth systems data such as that often collected and used by ocean and earth systems scientists. In July of 2008, a one-meter Magic Planet was installed at Oregon State University's (OSU) Hatfield Marine Science Center Visitors Center (VC). Beginning immediately, base line use data were collected, recommendations were made for changes to the physical context and conceptual content of the exhibit and development of new materials was begun. Following a significant period of time during which electrical, hardware, and software issues were identified and addressed, basic formative evaluation continued in parallel with development of a suite of evaluation tools to allow for visitor reflection on video of their interactions with the Magic Planet and its visualizations. This document outlines front-end and formative evaluation findings related to the Magic Planet installation and use by public audiences. Details of the evaluation rubrics that were developed for Science on a Sphere (SOS) Network use are reported in a second document, Promoting Meaning Making at Spherical Display Systems: Evaluation Toolkit (Rowe, et. al., 2010)."
