11,Abstract:,"Sea-cliff erosion is a problem along the coast of Oregon in that many communities have been built on terraces affected by bluff retreat. Considerable coast-wide variability in the rates of cliff erosion, not explainable in terms of ocean processes, is likely due to tectonic activity that is causing differential uplift rates along the coast. In areas where sea-cliff erosion is significant, there are marked differences in the nature of the erosion processes. Excluding the landslide areas, cliff retreat along the Oregon coast is occurring at a low rate, probably because of its tectonic setting that produces coastal uplift."
