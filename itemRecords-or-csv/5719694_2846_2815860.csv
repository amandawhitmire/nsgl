16,Abstract:,"Plasmid vectors encoding the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) nucleoprotein or glycoprotein gene under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter were used to immunize rainbow trout against IHNV. The plasmid DNA was injected into the skeletal muscle of rainbow trout fry, and immunization was determined by the detection of virus- neutralizing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody activity, and by protection against live virus challenge. The studies show that DNA vaccination will protect rainbow trout against the lethal effects of IHNV infection."
