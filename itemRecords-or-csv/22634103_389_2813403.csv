15,Abstract:,"Hosted by Oregon Sea Grant, this webinar is for students in grades 6-12 who want to explore careers in marine science. These webinar features three presenters: Maureen Walczak, a professor in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS). Paul Walczak, a coring technician in CEOAS. Brendan Reilly, a postdoctoral researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography who earned a Ph.D. from CEOAS They talk about how they insert long tubes into the seafloor to collect sediment so they can understand what organisms were present thousands of  years ago and what the environmental and oceanic conditions were like back then. They also discuss plans for an expedition aboard the Oceanus research ship to collect sediment from the seafloor off the Pacific Northwest. Lindsay Carroll, who coordinates Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program, serves as a moderator on this webinar, which was recorded on June 24, 2020."
