10,Abstract:,"Like New Zealand, Australia, and the U.S., Canada is in the process of modernizing its legal regime for offshore resource management. The histories of offshore federalism in Australia, the U.S., and Canada are remarkably similar; however, Canadian arrangements vary in a number of ways. The article examines Canada's approach to fishing, marine mammals, aquaculture, marine pollution, dredging and filling, marine protected areas, coastal zone management, sea-bed mining within the national jurisdiction, and offshore oil and gas. Canada has resolved offshore federalism issues on a province-​by-​province basis for some ocean-use sectors like offshore oil, rather than seek a comprehensive national solution for most ocean-use sectors, as Australia did. The next challenge for Canada appears to be to construct an effective mutiple-use EEZ management structure with significant provincial participation."
