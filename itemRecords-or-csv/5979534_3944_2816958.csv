14,Abstract:,"Scientists examined the genetic structure in grass rockfish ""Sebastes rastrelliger"" populations as a means of inferring patterns of their larval dispersal along the California- Oregon coast. They used polymorphic microsatellite loci to assess presumably neutral variation within the grass rockfish genome, allowing for multiple independent tests for the presence of population structure. The goal was to examine the pattern of population subdivision, infer the appropriate model of larval dispersal, and consider implications for fisheries management."
