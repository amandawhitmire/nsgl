12,Abstract:,"Juvenile ""Aplysia dactylomela"" were found feeding in abundance on the tropical brown alga ""Stypopodium zonale"", a seaweed previously shown to contain numerous unique terpene-quinone natural products strongly toxic to predaceous reef fish. Lipid extracts of these herbivorous mollusks contained appreciable quantities of two ""S. zonale"" metabolites as well as one new but closely related compound, 3-keto epitaondiol. A careful examination of the seaweed blades upon which the ""Aplysia"" were feeding failed to find detectable quantities of the new metabolite which is most likely a biotransformatiâ€‹on product. It would appear that these sea hares are capable of assimilating the secondary metabolite chemistry from a wide variety of diets, including ""S. zonale"", and furthermore that the secondary metabolites of a wide variety of algae can function in the sea hares' chemical defense strategy."
