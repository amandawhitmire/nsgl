12,Abstract:,"As a result of present studies, two new fatty acid metabolites have been isolated from the temperate red marine alga, ""Ptilota filicina"" (Ceramiales, Rhodophyta). The structures of these new compounds, isolated as their methyl ester derivatives, have been elucidated. Other species of the genus ""Ptilota"" from elsewhere in the world have been examined previously for new biomedicinal agents. Oregon coastal seaweeds have not been examined in detail, presumably due to the combination of adverse collection conditions and fewer reports of unique terpenoid natural products from temperate zone algae."
