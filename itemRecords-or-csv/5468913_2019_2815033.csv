13,Abstract:,"Three new dihydroxyicosan​oids have been isolated from a previously unstudied temperate red marine alga, ""Farlowia mollis"" (Cryptonemiales​, Rhodophyta), and their structures have been deduced. Collectively, these new natural products modulate fMLP- induced superoxide anion generation in human neutrophils, inhibit the conversion of arachidonic acid to lipoxygenase products by human neutrophils, and inhibit the functioning of the dog kidney Na+/K+-ATPase."
