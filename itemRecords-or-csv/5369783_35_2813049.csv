14,Abstract:,"The Sea Grant college program was created in 1966 by an act Of Congress, It is a nationally coordinated, university-â€‹based, grassroots, program with facilities. equipment, and staff in every coastal and Great Lake state. Sea Grant is a partnership of government, university, and industry. It is supported with funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, individual States, local governments, arid private sources. Oregon State University was among the first universities to establish such a program. Our goal is to integrate research, education, and extension functions in ways that will promote understanding, development, arid wise use of ocean and coastal resources. This biennial report documents the16th and 17th years of continuous operation of the Sea Grant program in Oregon."
