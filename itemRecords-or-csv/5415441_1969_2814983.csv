12,Abstract:,"Recent developments in aquaculture in Atlantic Canada have demonstrated a need for suitable structures for the growing of mussels and oysters. One of the greatest difficulties encountered has been damage to rafts and other equipment caused by winter ice. In order to avoid this damage and some other difficulties, a growing system based on submersible structures has been proposed. Accordingly, four prototype systems made largely of wood with plastic vessels for floatation have been built and tested over a period of 18 months. Results demonstrate the feasibility of submersible systems based on the prototypes."
