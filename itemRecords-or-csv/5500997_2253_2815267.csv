13,Abstract:,"As part of an exploratory study of the geology and biology of the upper Oregon subduction zone, reconnaissance dives were made on the northern shelf edge and upper slope to (1) ascertain the structure of the benthic assemblages present, and (2) study assemblages associated with possible active vents. Although abundant calcium carbonate slabs and chimneys occur on Nehalem Bank, there are now no active subduction-â€‹driven vents. However, hard deposits produced by venting have changed the nature of the animal community in the area by providing substrate for hard-bottom organisims. In addition to a typical outer continental shelf fine sand/mud community, a hard-substrate epifaunal community is also present."
