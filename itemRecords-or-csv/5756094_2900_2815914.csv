13,Abstract:,"Ohmic heating is known as a method of generating heat rapidly volumetriically throughout a conducting material. This technique has been used to aseptically process food particulates, maximize gel formation of Pacific whiting surimi, and remove high-​molecular-​weight proteins in surimi wash water (SWW). The objective of this study was to apply ohmic heating and ultrafiltration technology to evaluate the process for proteinase recovery from Pacific whiting SWW."
