11,Abstract:,"""Piscirickettsi​a salmonis"" is the first Gram-negative, intracellular bacterial pathogen isolated from fish and is a significant cause of mortality in salmonids. Recent reports of ""P. salmonis"" or ""P. salmonis""-like organisms from new fish hosts and geographic regions have increased interest in the bacterium. In this review, the important characteristics of the bacterium including recent taxonomic changes, features of the disease caused by the bacterium including transmission, hosts, reservoirs, diagnostic procedures, and current approaches for prevention and treatment are discussed."
