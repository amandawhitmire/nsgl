18,Abstract:,"One of the major problems encountered in natural product drug discovery programs is the dereplication of known compounds. The ability to identify known or nuisance compounds at an early stage of fractionation represents huge savings in both time and effort. Here scientists present two new diffusion-​edited NMR experiments, improved DECODES and HETDECODES, that sort the constituents in a mixture by their individual diffusion coefficients. These experiments should allow the partial NMR spectral assignment and cursory elucidation of compounds in a complex mixture as an aid in the dereplication of known or nuisance compounds."
