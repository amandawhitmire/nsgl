12,Abstract:,"A Wood-boat maintenance fact sheet. Accidental damage to the hull, marine-borer attack, and fungal decay are the commonest reasons for repairing wood boats. Physical damage and marine-borer attack are usually obvious, but decay is not easy to detect. Knowing the causes of decay helps in recognizing its effects, hopefully early enough to avoid the need for expensive repairs."
