11,Abstract:,"Fish spoil quickly if you don't handle them properly from the moment you land them. Mishandle fresh fish, and you end up with softened flesh, a strong flavor, and a 'fishy' or sour odor. Handle fresh fish properly, and you will enjoy a delicate flavor, fine texture, and a pleasing or neutral odor. This pamphlet covers proper handling in order to preserve good eating quality. It addresses killing, bleeding, and gutting the fish, and chilling with ice."
