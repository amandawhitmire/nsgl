11,Abstract:,"As part of an OSU Sea Grant project concerning environmental data to support aquaculture research, we found it necessary to record salinity at the seawater intake to the Marine Science Center, Newport, OR. The operating personnel at the Center also desired that the system give an alarm indication when salinity reached or was less than 25 o /oo. We chose to use a variation on the standard hydrometer (floating density sensor) for simplicity and low maintenance. This report describes the resulting system; it has been in operational use since January 1981."
