13,Abstract:,"The rapid increase of cage salmon culture in fjords, estuaries and sea loch regions of the world requires an oceanographic understanding of the system. The cage salmon industry in South America has been very successful and Chile is one of the leaders in worldwide production. This report is a first response to the demand for an adequate data set on which to build improved cage salmon management in Chilean fjords and inland waters. It treats both the oceanographic and meteorological variables that together define the present `environment,' as well as the climatic or longer term behavior of the physical/chemicâ€‹al factors that control the environment."
