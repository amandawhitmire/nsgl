14,Abstract:,"The class is about to embark on an investigation of a special type of coastal ecosystem-​-​estuaries. Estuaries are special resources, places where the fresh water of rivers and streams meets and mixes with the salt water of the ocean. This investigation will be conducted under the guidance of the Estuary: an Ecosystem and a Resource EER! curriculum. This guide is intended to provide the classroom teacher with 1. teaching strategies for incorporating EER into the high school science program, 2. answer keys, 3. classroom discussion guides, and 4. materials for evaluating student understanding of estuaries. The staff at the South Slough Estuarine Sanctuary is willing to assist the teacher answering any questions regarding this curriculum and by helping the teacher organize field trips to the sanctuary. The sanctuary staff would greatly appreciate receiving any helpful suggestions, new materials that a class developed, and evaluations of this curriculum."
