17,Abstract:,"Oregon is ground zero for ocean acidification impacts--the water chemistry off our coast is already changing and has changed dramatically. For a glimpse into the science, the impacts and the information gaps behind ocean acidification in Oregon, check out this video. Oregon researchers, industry members and policy leaders have teamed up to better comprehend these chemical changes to our marine waters. While there are still many unknowns about specific impacts, large scale changes are likely to occur. And ultimately, these changes have the potential to impact everyone that lives here."
