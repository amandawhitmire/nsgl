11,Abstract:,"Two novel oxylipins incorporating a 2-​oxabicyclo[2.2.​1]heptane ring system have been isolated from the marine brown alga ""Cymathere triplicata"" and characterized as their methyl ester derivatives by spectroscopic methods. A biogenetic scheme for cymathere ether A is presented in which the initial step is dioxygenation of steariadonic acid mediated by a 10-​lipoxygenase."
