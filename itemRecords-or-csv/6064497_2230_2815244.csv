10,Abstract:,"Two short videos on this DVD address very common safety issues on Pacific Northwest coasts: the dangers associated with rolling logs and with rip currents. All too often, visitors to our beaches are unfamiliar with the hazards of playing on dangerous large logs that may roll in the surf or with the frightening force of a rip current, which can pull swimmers out to sea. The separate videos explain these hazards and how to avoid or respond safely to them, using interviews with experts to emphasize key insights. The videos are intended for use in settings where coastal visitors congregate, to provide critical safety information at point of use. Users may include coastal museums, science centers, hotels, motels, campgrounds, and local cable television."
