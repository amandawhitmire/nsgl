11,Abstract:,"An extensive deposit of black sands is found on the ocean beaches adjacent to the mouth of the Columbia River in the Northwest U.S. This study focuses on the textural and mineralogical characteristics of this placer with the objective of understanding the processes of selective sorting as the sand is transported alongshore away from the river mouth. Grain settling velocities have been measured, and entrainment flow stresses and bedload transport rates of the principal minerals have been evaluated in order to establish which processes are significant to the formation of these black sands. The results of this study lead to a better understanding of grain sorting during longshore sand transport and of the processes that can lead to the development of heavy-mineral placers."
