10,Abstract:,"The exploration and development of mineral and hydrocarbon deposits in submerged lands raise difficult management conflicts, especially where potential conflicts are not dealt with prior to the creation of private rights in the deposits. Substantive principles for resolving use conflicts in submerged lands have not been developed by the courts under the public trust doctrine and related judicial approaches. Thus, some state legislatures have provided submerged lands agencies with management principles and formal planning and cooperation processes to implement them so that use conflicts can be avoided. Both formal and informal methods have been used to deal with the submerged lands management problems of multiple state permits and federal-state permit coordination. Legally separating exploration rights from development rights significantly aids the resolution of conflicts."
