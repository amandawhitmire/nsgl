14,Abstract:,"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a birnavirus that causes one of the most serious diseases in trout and salmon farms in North America, Europe, and Asia. It can also kill a number of nonsalmonid fish. Most IPNV isolates are closely related antigenically, yet they exhibit marked differences in host-range in-vivo and in-vitro, in pathogenicity, and in temperature of replication. This paper reviews recent efforts to unravel the mechanisms that biologically distinguish the different IPNV isolates by characterizing the immunoreactive regions of the major capsid protein of the Sp serotype of IPNV."
