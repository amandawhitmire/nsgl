11,Abstract:,"Water, Water Everywhere suggests some ways teachers can bring marine education into their classrooms. Teachers can help Oregon students learn about how salt and fresh waters affect their lives. And they can do it without complicated change, often merely by substituting one good example for another. Marine education is especially relevant in Oregon schools. Oregon's history, culture, climate, and economy have been shaped and maintained by our ocean and our rivers; they will shape our future. This guide and the related learning activities were developed with the assistance of a number of educators; the project itself was overseen cooperatively by Oregon State University and the Oregon Department of Education, It is through alliances such as these that our overall goal of excellence will be achieved-​providing students with the best that education has to offer. The study of marine education can enrich various courses already established in the curriculum. We urge readers to turn to the section of this guide on safety, to make matters of safety a prime consideration in all instructional activities."
