14,Abstract:,"The potential of an immersion system of glucose oxidase (GOX, 1 unit/mL) and catalase (CAT) added to 4% w/v glucose in artificial seawater was determined for on-board shrimp preservation. Other objectives were to identify the mechanisms responsible for discoloration of the enzymatic (GOX/CAT) solution, and to estimate in a model system when the solution would need to be replaced. The model system consisted of fresh irradiated shrimps inoculated with ""Pseudomonas fluorescens,"" a main component of the microflora in Pacific Northwest shrimp which becomes predominant during cold storage."
