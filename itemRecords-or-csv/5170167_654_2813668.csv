11,Abstract:,"The report begins with a brief discussion of certain aspects of the production arid consumption of Pacific Coast salmon. This is followed by a description of some structural characteristics of the market for canned salmon. The next section of the report reviews some of the earlier work on demand for canned salmon. This leads into the presentation of the econometric model developed in the present study to estimate the parameters of the postulated demand relationships. This section also presents the results of the statistical analysis. Finally, the report discusses progress to date, advances additional hypotheses generated by the research, and describes how the reported research is affecting on-going analysis."
