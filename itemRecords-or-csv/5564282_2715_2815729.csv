15,Abstract:,"Salmonid aquaculture is a rapidly growing industry in the sheltered coastal waters of southern Chile; however, coho salmon ""Oncorhynchus kisutch"" reared in seawater netpens in this area have experienced an ongoing epizootic. Kidney tissue from moribund coho salmon was inoculated onto a chinook salmon embryo cell line and a previously undescribed rickettsia was isolated. This report documents the quantitative experimental infection of coho and Atlantic salmon in 1989. It details the production of the disease with accompanying mortality, and the recovery of the etiologic agent from the experimentally infected fish."
