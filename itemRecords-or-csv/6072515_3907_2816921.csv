14,Abstract:,"The interest in safer raw fish products obtained by high pressure processing is increasing. However, the pressure (higher than 400 MPa) and time (1-5 min) needed to reduce the microbial load in muscle products denatures myofibrillar proteins and changes their mechanical, functional and visual properties. The objective for this study was to evaluate the stabilizing effect of sucrose, trehalose, sorbitol and their mixtures (1:1) on myofibrillar arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) proteins subjected to pressure treatments. Fish proteins solubilized with 2.5% salt and 4, 8 and 12% sucrose, sorbitol, trehalose or 1:1 mixtures of sucrose-​sorbitol and trehalose-​sorbitol were subjected to 600 MPa for 5 min. Texture profile analysis, protein solubility, heat induced gelling and color parameters were used to quantify pressure effects. Sorbitol at 8 and 12% was the most efficient stabilizing agent against high pressure effects on protein functionality."
