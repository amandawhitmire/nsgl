13,Notes:,"Adapting to Change (series): Fishing Families, Businesses, Communities, and Regions."
14,Abstract:,"Commercial fishing can take fathers away from their families for long periods. The work is often financially unpredictable and inherently dangerous. These factors pose special challenges to fishing families. Drawing on ideas from fishing families, the authors offer practical advice for seafaring fathers who wish to forge strong bonds with their children, from infancy to their teen years. The suggestions are tied to the child's age and developmental patterns."
