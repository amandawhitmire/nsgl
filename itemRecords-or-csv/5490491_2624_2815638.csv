13,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) is a highly contagious and lethal viral disease of certain species of Pacific salmon and trout. Rapid detection of an IHN epizootic is important so that infected fish may be quarantined. No vaccines or antiviral drugs are available for the control of this disease, and avoidance of the pathogen is the only means of control. Described here is a fluorescent antibody test designed to enhance the speed of detection and confirmation of IHNV with a specific antiserum. Results indicate this is useful as a diagnostic aid and as a tool to study the biology of IHNV."
