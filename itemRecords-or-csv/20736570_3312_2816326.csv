9,Abstract:,"In this thesis, we review the co-produced coastal adaptation policies being explored by KTANs in both Tillamook County, OR and Grays Harbor County, WA, two regions of the US West Coast that have experienced vastly different coastal evolution in the last few decades and therefore have significant differences in their exposure to coastal flood and erosion hazards. We examine how variations in local priorities drive the co-development of different policies and policy scenario narratives across the two locations, and how metrics of importance to local stakeholders (e.g., the number of buildings impacted by flooding) change over time under different climate and policy scenarios. We also explore the scalability of this approach, and provide recommendations for continuing to utilize the co-developed alternative futures process. By collaborating with regional decision-makers on the project from the beginning, this work aims to co-develop usable, quantitative information and alternative adaptation policy scenarios for local communities that will promote coastal hazard resilience."
