15,Abstract:,"This report looks at a subgroup within Oregon’s groundfish trawl fleet known as the nearshore fleet. To understand this self-described “beach fleet,” researchers interviewed nearshore fishermen and fisheries managers. They also examined bottom trawl logbooks and fish tickets from  the 1980s to 2017 to learn where the fleet was fishing and which species were important to it. The report also describes how the fleet changed its fishing nets and practices to comply with regulations that aimed to bolster struggling populations of groundfish."
