11,Abstract:,"Little is known about fish regarding any direct effects that seawater- or stress-induced hydromineral imbalances may have on spontaneous or stimulated corticosteroid secretion. Research here was undertaken to determine the effects of Na+ and K+ concentrations and osmolality on the spontaneous and adrenocorticotr​opin-​stimulated cortisol secretion by the interrenal tissue of juvenile coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"")."
