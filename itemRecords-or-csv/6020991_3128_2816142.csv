10,Abstract:,"My investigations of the natural products of marine algae have resulted in the discovery of several new secondary metabolites. Bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of these new compounds and spectroscopic analysis was utilized in their structural characterizatio​n. Two new and potent antimitotic metabolites, curacins B and C, were isolated from a Curacao collection of Lyngbya majuscula. In addition, four curacin A analogs were prepared by semisynthetic methods. The structures of the new curacins and the curacin A analogs were determined by spectroscopic analysis in comparison with curacin A. The biological properties of the new natural products and synthetic derivatives of curacin A were examined. Investigations of another Curacao collection of L. majuscula revealed a new cytotoxic lipopeptide, microcolin C. Microcolin C was found to have an interesting profile of cytotoxicity to human cancer-derived cell lines. A new metabolite, vidalenolone, was isolated from an Indonesian red alga Vidalia sp. The structure of this new cyclopentenolon​e-​ containing compound was determined by a combination of spectroscopic methods. Filamentous cells isolated from female gametophytes of the brown alga Laminaria saccharins! were cultured in flasks or bioreactors. These cultures produced a variety of $omega6$- lipoxygenase metabolites: 13-​hydroxy-​9,11-​octadecadienoic​acid (13- HODE), 13-​hydroxy-​6,9,11,15-​octadecatetraen​oic acid (13-HODTA), and 15-​hydroxy-​5,8,11,13-​eicosatetraenoi​c acid (15-HETE). Five oxidized anandamide derivatives were prepared from anandamide through autoxidation in an exploration of ligand binding to the cannabinoid receptor. Their structures were determined by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS. The cannabinoid receptor binding affinity of these derivatives was evaluated. This study revealed the following trend in activity: anandamide $>$ 15- $>$ 9- $>$ 8- $>$ 11- $>$ 5- hydroxyanandami​de."
