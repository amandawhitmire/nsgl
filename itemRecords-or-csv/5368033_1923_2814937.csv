12,Abstract:,"Results conflict with the notion of heightened olfactory sensitivity during salmon smoltification. A difference of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in sensitivity to serine between zero-age parr and smolts was found; for alanine, a decrease of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in sensitivity, as the fish transformed from yearling parr to smolts. If olfactory imprinting does occur sometime during smoltification, a decrease in olfactory sensitivity would not be an expected physiological adaptation. Absolute levels of olfactory sensitivity, however, may not play an important part in home-stream imprinting. Instead, long-term memory of whatever odors are present above threshold concentrations during the period of imprinting may be the essential requirement."
