10,Abstract:,"Research supported by Oregon Sea Grant indicates that a parasite called Ceratomyxa shasta is a primary contributor to the decline of salmon in the Klamath River. Researchers have identified a particular stretch of the river in which high densities of the parasite are resulting in severe disease and death rates, thus providing a target for management actions to help solve the problem. This publication provides background on the research, discusses the life cycle of Ceratomyxa shasta and its effects on salmon, and presents the results of the study, including recommended management actions."
