10,Abstract:,The author summarizes encounters between marine mammals and debris and active fishing gear observed since 1968. Gray whales have been the cetaceans most commonly involved with fishing gear along the Oregon coast; their most frequent entanglement problem was during experimental crab fishing with helicopters from 1976 to 1978. The pinnipeds that most often encounter commercial fishing gear are seals on the Columbia River during active gillnet fishing. A three-year study of 57 beach-cast pinnipeds in Oregon revealed that shooting was the leading diagnosable cause of death for adult harbor seals. Pinnipeds have also choked to death on swallowed debris and fish.
