10,Abstract:,"Two short videos on this DVD focus attention on the risks and responses to a tsunami hitting the Oregon coast. While the occurrence of such ""monster waves"" is currently impossible to predict, planning is possible and prudent, and Oregon Sea Grant is concentrating research and community education to help coastal citizens and communities prepare. ""Reaching Higher Ground: focuses on Seaside, Oregon, and interrelated research and outreach efforts to benefit that vulnerable community, while the succinct ""Three Things You Need to Know"" distills critical information about tsunami readiness that every coastal resident and visitor should know."
