9,Abstract:,"Nereocystis luetkeana, bull kelp, is an ecologically and economically important species that is found along the Pacific coast. This study describes the epiphytic community associated with drifting Nereocystis in the South Slough estuary, the placement and conditions of drifters in the South Slough, and a previously undescribed aspect of the Nereocystis life cycle. Data from monthly boat surveys of drifting and attached individuals suggest seasonal epiphytic community changes. The life cycle of Nereocystis includes a diploid, macroscopic sporophyte stage and a haploid, microscopic gametophyte state. Adult sporophytes were found releasing structures that appear to be embryonic sporophytes. The amount of DNA in gametophyte, embryonic sporophyte, and adult sporophyte protoplasts was quantified with DAPI staining and image analysis. The released embryonic sporophytes were diploid and indicate a life history strategy previously unknown in kelps. This has not been documented before and augments the available knowledge of the life cycle of Nereocystis."
