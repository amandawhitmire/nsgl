13,Abstract:,"This study illustrated how reliable routes for the development of suspension cultures of macrophytic red algae (""Agardhiella subulate"") of terete thallus morphology can be achieved for biotechnology applications. Oxygen evolution rate vs. irradiance measurements showed that relative to the filament clumps, microplantlets had a higher maximum specific oxygen evolution rate, but comparable respiration rate, compensation point, and light intensity at 63.2% of saturation. The microplantlet culture was more suitable for suspension culture development than the filament clump culture because it was morphologically stable and exhibited higher growth rates."
