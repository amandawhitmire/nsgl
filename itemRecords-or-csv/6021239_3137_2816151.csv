9,Abstract:,"Macrophytic marine algae are a rich source of unique natural products. Controlled biological production of these compounds first requires the development of an engineered biomass production system to illustrate the application of bioprocess engineering principles to this new area of marine biotechnology. Toward this end, two axenic liquid suspension cultures were established for Agardhiella subulata including an undifferentiate​d filament clump culture established by induction of callus-like tissue from thallus explants, and a microplantlet culture established by regeneration of callus filaments. The microplantlet culture was selected for bioreactor cultivation studies because it was morphologically stable. Controlled cultivation of Agardhiella subulata microplanklet suspension was successful in both externally-​illuminated bubble- column and stirred-tank bioreactors. Limiting process parameters on biomass production, including temperature, pH, CO2 delivery, light transfer, macronutrient consumption, agitation intensity, and microplantlet morphology were assessed. The optimal growth temperature was 24 deg. C. The optimal pH environment for cultivation was centered around pH 8. The growth was not CO2 limited in either bioreactor system when aerated at 0.3 vvm containing 3500 ppm CO2 in the aeration gas."
