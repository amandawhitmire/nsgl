13,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus which causes devastating epizootics of trout and salmon fry in hatcheries around the world. Epizootic survivors are considered virus free and are subsequently released into the wild. When adults return to spawn, infectious virus can again be isolated. Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for the source of virus in these adults. One hypothesis contends that virus in the epizootic survivors is cleared and that the adults are reinfected; the second contends that IHNV persists in a subclinical or latent form and the virus is reactivated during the stress of spawning. In the study reported here, IHNV-specific lesions in the hematopoietic tissues of rainbow trout survivors, reared specific-​pathogen-​free water, were detected 1 year after the epizootic. The fish did not produce infectious virus. The presence of viral protein confirmed the presence of IHNV in the survivors and provided the first evidence for subclinical persistence of virus in the tissues of IHNV survivors."
