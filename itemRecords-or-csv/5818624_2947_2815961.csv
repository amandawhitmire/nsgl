13,Abstract:,"The lipid extract of the temperate red alga ""Rhodymenia pertusa"" has yielded four eicosanoid metabolites, three of which are new natural products. Using principally NMR and MS techniques, the authors of this study deduced their structures. The co-occurrence of these particular metabolites strongly suggests that ""R. pertusa"" contains a unique 5R-lipoxygenase system acting on both arachidonic and eicosapentaenoi​c acids."
