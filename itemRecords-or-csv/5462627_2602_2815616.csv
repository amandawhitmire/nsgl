14,Abstract:,"The effects of acute stress on the immune system and disease resistance of juvenile chinook salmon were examined. Immune function was measured by the ability of lymphocytes from the anterior kidney to generate specific antibody-​producing cells (APC). The objective was to correlate changes in plasma cortisol concentration, the ability of lymphocytes from the anterior kidney to generate APC in-vitro, and disease resistance in acutely stressed fish. Findings suggest that similar endocrine-​immune interactions operate in the mammalian and salmonid systems during acute stress."
