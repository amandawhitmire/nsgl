10,Abstract:,"Biochemical properties, functional properties, and market potential of Pacific whiting (PW) fish sauce were investigated. Biochemical properties of fish sauce made from whole fish (W) and a mixture (1:1) of whole fish and surimi byproducts (WB) were compared. Market potential was evaluated through phone interviews and consumer panelists. Proteolysis was primarily affected by cathepsin B-like and L-like enzymes. Acidic pH (4-5) with low salt concentration (15-20%) provided a greater degree of hydrolysis (DH), total nitrogen, and amino nitrogen content in PW fish sauce compared to the traditional process. The greatest Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibition (96.8%) was found in samples fermented with 15% salt at pH 5.0 for 30 days. Anti-oxidative activity (AT) increased when fermentation continued and depended on fermentation pH. Peptides with MW <590 Da possibly played an important role in ACE inhibition. Consumer tests disclosed no significant difference in flavor liking and overall liking among fish sauce samples (W, WB, and commercial anchovy fish sauce)."
