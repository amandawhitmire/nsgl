10,Abstract:,"Many factors affect decisions on design and application of onboard refrigeration systems. One of these is energy consumption, the concern for which has fluctuated, but which will undoubtedly assume a growing priority in the near future. This article addresses the direct energy costs of onboard refrigeration for both RSW (refrigerated seawater) which uses mechanical refrigeration, and CSW (chilled seawater) which uses ice brought from shore. RSW is found to consume energy at roughly half the rate predicted for CSW; seawater temperature has a major influence on results."
