13,Abstract:,"Clam digging is an exciting, inexpensive, and popular sport that combines fun and outdoor recreation for the entire family. It also provides a year-round source of excellent food. Living within Oregon's coastal bays are one or more of five major clam species—gaper, ​ cockle, littleneck, butter, and softshell. The OSU Extension/Sea Grant Program, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and members of the oyster industry are cooperating to supplement the native littleneck stocks through the introduction of the Manila littleneck clam in several Oregon bays. The razor clam, another major species, inhabits the sandy, surf-pounded beaches along certain sections of the coast. It's occasionally found in the lower portions of several bays."
