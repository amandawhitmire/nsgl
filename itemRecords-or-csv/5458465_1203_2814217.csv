12,Abstract:,"Seawalls and riprap revetments are used on the Oregon coast to protect properties threatened during erosion of seacliffs and sand spits. Most have not been designed by engineers, and therefore commonly do not follow sound design practices. They often are grossly overbuilt and do not take into consideration the processes of erosion and beach morphology. Particularly difficult is the protection of high cliffs where the structures can defend only the toe of the slope. Questions have been raised as to whether the structures might contribute to erosion of the beach and adjacent unprotected properties. Although such adverse impacts have been demonstrated in the laboratory, coastal rip currents produce significant longshore variability and tend to mask impacts by structures. Beach topography changes adjacent to seven structures, including both seawalls and riprap, are currently being monitored with the objective of determining whether the structures do cause erosion."
