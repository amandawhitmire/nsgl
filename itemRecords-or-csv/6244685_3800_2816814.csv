12,Abstract:,"Beach water quality throughout the nation is threatened due to high levels of bacteria that reside either in the beach's sediment or the near-shore bathing areas. Forecasting the variation in bacteria levels is essential to determining whether the beach is recreationally safe. Apart from the risks of accidental injuries, the major human-health concern for recreational waters is contamination by bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Although numerous sources such as aging sewage systems and agricultural runoff contribute pollutants to recreational areas; due to the complexity of the watershed where these sources reside, past studies ignored its influences on coastal beaches. However, since the watershed provides the basic hydrologic structure for catching storm-water flow and funneling it, along with pollutants, to coastal beaches, we hypothesize that watershed activities, such as urbanization and agriculture, contribute to variations in beach's bacterial levels. In this study, highly-solved, spatially-​explicit physical hydro-​meteorological data such as precipitation, runoff, wind direction, and air temperature; as well as biological data, were analyzed to try to predict E.coli counts. With the aid of a four-​dimensional, data-​visualization tool (which locates the sources of pollution), also developed during this study; an Early Warning System for beach closure events was developed as a function of antecedent rainfall, runoff, wind direction, and watershed air temperatures. This Early Warning System uses commonly (and nationally) available data and is programmed in an exportable language so that it can be easily transferred to any beach. Both the data-​visualization tool and the Early Warning System will be presented."
