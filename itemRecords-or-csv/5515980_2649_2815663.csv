10,Abstract:,"This article is a status report on implementation to date of the Pacific Salmon Treaty. The first section provides historical background on the treaty. The next section describes its governing principles, as well as the Pacific Salmon Commission's organization and resonsibilitiesâ€‹. The third section discusses the treaty's implementation over the past three years, followed by analysis of the treaty's implementation noting that the Commission has failed to address long-term management issues. It is concluded that the Commission should (1) adopt long-term goals to provide an overall framework for its research, conservation, and enhancement efforts, and (2) incorporate habitat protection into its management program."
