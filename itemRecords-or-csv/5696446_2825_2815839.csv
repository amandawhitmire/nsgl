12,Abstract:,"The vertebrate interferon system provides an initial line of defense against viral infection by inducing the synthesis of proteins that inhibit virus replication. The role of the Mx proteins in resistance to negative-​stranded RNA viruses has been well established. How fish interferons induce antiviral resistance in cells has never been determined, and the interferon-​inducible mediators of antiviral activity in fish have not been well characterized. Thus, this study attempted to define the fole of Mx proteins in the salmonid fish. A previous report provided evidence of a rainbow trout Mx gene in the RNA of a liver treated with poly (I)-c, a potent interferon inducer. The trout Mx- related sequences were detected with an Mx gene probe that was originally isolated from perch. Reported here is the cDNA cloning of a rainbow trout Mx gene; its expression ""in vivo"" in response to infection with the fish rhabdovirus, IHNV, is demonstrated."
