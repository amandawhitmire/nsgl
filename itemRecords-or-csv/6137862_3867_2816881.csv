11,Abstract:,"Invasive species were introduced into the United States as a result of trade, commerce, and the fulfillment of cultural needs. The control of invasive species has more to do with economic policy than with biology and ecology. Early detection, rapid response, and prevention are among the most effective and efficient ways of reducing the environmental and economic costs of invasive species. ""The Economics of Invasive Species"" shows how economics can provide the tools we need to understand the drivers of the invasive species problem and the costs and benefits of different control measures. Case studies on the gypsy moth, tansy ragwort, zebra mussels, invasive plant removal and revegetation, and sudden oak death demonstrate the economic effects of invasive species on natural resources. This publication is intended for members of the public, government agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations who are interested in enhancing their education about or increasing their involvement in preventing, eradicating, and controlling invasive species."
