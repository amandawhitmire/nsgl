12,Abstract:,"Measured variations of pivoting angles with grain size, shape and imbrication are employed in analyses of grain threshold to examine how these factors influence selective grain entrainment and sorting. The analysis demonstrates quantitatively that there should be a series of nearly-parallel threshold curves depending on grain pivoting angles; the pivoting angle also depends on the ratio of its size to those it rests upon. This dependence permits an evaluation of selective entrainment by size of grains from a bed of mixed sizes, the condition generally found in natural sediments. The pivoting model predicts systematic departures from the standard threshold curves for uniform grain sizes, in agreement with results of recent studies of gravel threshold in rivers and offshore tidal currents."
