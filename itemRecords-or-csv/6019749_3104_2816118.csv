12,Abstract:,"Surimi processing, which includes several unit operations, can be divided into two major stages (Fig. 1). The first stage includes heading, gutting, deboning, and mincing, which prepare the fish mince for the washing and refining operations of the second stage. Streams of water are injected into the heading, gutting, and deboning machines during the first stage to remove fish fluid and the muscle meat that adheres to the machines. The injected water also provides lubrication to promote smooth operation. In addition, fish are comminuted during the first stage into mince, 3-4 mm in diameter, which is then pumped to unit operations for washing and refining. In the second stage, fish mince is repeatedly washed with chilled water and dewatered to produce high-quality surimi. The water/mince ratio and the number of washing cycles may differ depending on the desired surimi quality. For at-sea surimi operations, where fresh fish are readily available and water is limited, only one washing cycle may be used, whereas washing may be repeated three to five times for shore- based production (1,2)."
