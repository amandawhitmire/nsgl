14,Abstract:,"Pacific whiting surimi was made from stabilized mince (SM), unstablized mince (UM), and headed and gutted (H&G) fish kept in frozen storage and compared to a surimi control made from fresh fillets. SM was made by mixing fresh mince with 12% w/w sucrose and 0.2% w/w polyphosphates. Surimi was produced from SM, UM, H&G at 1, 30, 90, and 180 days and evaluated by torsion, measuring shear stress, and true strain. After 6 months, there were no differences (p>0.05) between surimi samples prepared from SM stored at -20 deg C and -50 deg C and the control surimi. UM and H&G fish produced surimi of inferior quality."
