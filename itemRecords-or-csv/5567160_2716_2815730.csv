11,Abstract:,"Stress-induced increases in glucocorticoid secretion have been shown to have a wide variety of effects on the mammalian immune system; these effects appear to be mediated through specific glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in leukocytes. The endocrine response of Pacific salmon (""Oncorhynchus"" spp.) to stress, similar to that of mammals, is marked by a transient increase in plasma cortisol titers. Objectives in this study were to determine (1) if there were changes in the number or affinity of GR in leukocytes and gill of coho salmon during acute or chronic stress, and (2) if effects seen in GR could be attributable to the direct action of cortisol."
