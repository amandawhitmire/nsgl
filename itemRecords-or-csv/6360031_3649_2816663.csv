13,Abstract:,"This paper examines secondary science teachers' perspectives of the role that mentoring by a scientist and science educator pair played in their professional development. Multiple data sources from three years of a professional development project, including interviews, participant reflections, and a focus group, were used to examine the benefits, supporting characteristics​, and challenges of the mentoring relationship. Results indicated that primary benefits of the mentoring included assistance in translating science content and inquiry-based pedagogy from the professional development into practice and breaking the isolation felt by secondary science teachers. Specific characteristics that were found to support the teachers in the mentoring relationship included: (1) mentors who were seen as objective, outside observers; (2) a sustained relationship with the mentors; and (3) accountability. Challenges included matching scientists' and science educators' content expertise with teachers' curriculum and the negotiation of roles and expectations between the teachers and mentors."
