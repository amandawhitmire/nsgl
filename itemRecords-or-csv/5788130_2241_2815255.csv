11,Abstract:,"Recreational boating is big business in Oregon, accounting for more than $1 billion a year in spending and providing jobs for at least 29,000 people. This publication looks at the economics of the industry, from boat and equipment sales to such services as whitewater rafting, charter fishing, and windsurfing. The study found that registered recreational boaters (those who own motorboats or long sailboats) had the greatest economic impact on the state. They spent more than $850 million on their boats and activities; nonregistered recreational boating generated more than $131 million in the same period, and commercial operations, such as river cruises, charter boats, and tours, generated nearly $17 million."
