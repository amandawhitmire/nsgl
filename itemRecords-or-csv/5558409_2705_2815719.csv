10,Abstract:,"The legal regimes in Australia and New Zealand governing offshore zones, fisheries, marine mammals, marine pollution, dredging and filling, marine protected areas, coastal zone management, sea-bed mining, and offshore oil and gas are compared. New Zealand, although a relatively small island nation, has dealt with its resources in a particularly meaningful way. A major thesis of this article is that New Zealand's progress to date is due in part to the absence of the complications federalism injects into EEZ management in Australia, Canada, and the United States. Two other articles in this 3-part series will evaluate and compare the EEZ management regimes of Canada and the United States."
