12,Abstract:,"The success of commercial fishermen and their attitudes about that success are dimensions which require consideration in implementing management regulations designed to limit entry, improve the livelihood of fishermen, and reduce costs to the consumer. This case study of the fishing success and attitudes of Oregon commercial fishermen reveals a diversity of attitudes about fishing success, about competition between harvesters, and about the relations with other harvesters. In addition, the measurement of the success of commercial fishermen is subject to a number of qualifications (Appendix). All of these factors operate to reduce recognition of the need for new forms of fisheries management."
