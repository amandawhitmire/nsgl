10,Abstract:,"The development of market-based fishery management programs has met serious sociocultural resistance in many fisheries worldwide. This paper analyzes the development of three market-based fishery management plans in West Coast US fisheries to understand the role of the initial social and economic conditions and their subsequent interaction on the development path of regulation. Case studies demonstrate the importance of the initial intervention point, the attributes of users and managers, and the development process itself to program outcome."
