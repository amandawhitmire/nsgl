11,Abstract:,"The role of a commercial freezer is to extract heat from a stream of product, converting most of the free moisture to a solid. This extraction must be sufficiently rapid so the product will experience minimum quality degradation, the rate keeps pace with the production schedule, and the average product temperature on exit roughly matches the subsequent storage temperature. Surimi, which is stabilized, uncooked, washed mince, is frozen almost exclusively as rectangular blocks in plate freezers. Surimi seafoods, on the other hand, are cooked and formed products made from surimi and other ingredients. Freezing of these products most commonly occurs in contact with cold air and cryogenic gases in blast or spiral freezers. Freezing systems currently in use are reviewed."
