11,Abstract:,"A simulation technique was used to determine which hypotheses in an exploratory model contributed to the fit between calculated and empirical time series of year-class strength. The hypotheses dealt with ecological relationships operating sequentially at various stages in the life cycle of English sole. The relationships were complex because independent variables affected intermediate precursor products (e.g., spawning dates or egg numbers) that were influenced in turn by the same or other independent variables to determine later precursor products (e.g., hatching success) and subsequent end products (e.g., number of juveniles). The combination of mechanisms involved in recruitment were studied more readily with explicit numerical and functional relationships by use of a simulation modeling approach than by the usual approach of fitting a multivariate response surface."
