12,Abstract:,"Stress is known to lower the ability of fishes to resist pathogens. Knowledge of the hormonal response to common stressors associated with fish cultural practices can be of benefit in designing procedures and rearing strategies that could minimi ze stress. Studies linking the stress-induced cortisol response to immunosuppressiâ€‹on and impaired disease resistance in salmonid fishes allow suggestions for alleviating stress-induced immune dysfunction and hypotheses aimed at developing prophyla ctics and therapeutics for use in health managmment. Objectives in this paper are to review the nature of current research, considering the theoretical basis for the studies as well as findings."
