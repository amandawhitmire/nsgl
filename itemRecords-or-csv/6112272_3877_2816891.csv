9,Abstract:,"The presence of mercury in the fish supply is a growing public health concern to seafood consumers. Nearly all the states, as well as the federal government, have issued consumption advice to limit or avoid eating certain fish as the result of high mercury levels. Consumer reaction to consumption advisories, however, is unpredictable. Being voluntary in nature, advisories typically miss their intended audiences, may be misconstrued to apply to non-target species, and may lead to resource waste if landed fish are discarded due to changes in consumer demand. At the current time, no pre-harvest methods are used to control the amount of contaminants that reach fish consumers. Given that mercury bioaccumulates in fish, contamination can vary significantly by size- and/or age class. This suggests that a more directed, size-based management of marine fisheries that explicitly accounts for the economic dynamics of optimal harvesting in the presence of contamination could lead to public health improvements by limiting the amount of mercury that reaches consumers. This research examines the economic feasibility of such a management regime through the development of a bioeconomic model of the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla) fishery."
