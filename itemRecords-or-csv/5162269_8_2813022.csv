15,Abstract:,"This is our tenth Sea Grant report during the dozen years of Sea Grant history in Oregon. The focus of the message has been remarkably constant: Sea Grant is a people program, oriented toward our linkage with the sea. Sea Grant trains students to work on marine problems, conducts research to answer complex questions about the sea, then attempts to make pertinent information available to all who can use it. This report is people oriented and we have chosen to tell you about four of many very special people who are working or who have worked in the OSU Sea Grant College Program. These four people are Ed Condon, John Fryer, Court Smith, and Bruce Mate and cover areas such as Fish disease, Fish research, anthropology, and marine mammals. This report includes a listing of projects, a publications listing, and a budget summary all for 1978-1979."
