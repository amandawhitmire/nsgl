11,Abstract:,"The controversial Winchester project on Oregon's North Umpqua River is used to examine federal and state regulatory schemes governing small-scale hydropower. Between 1982 and 1985 this 1.5 megawatt project received state and federal approvals, was constructed, and experienced two years of troubled operation before it was shut down. The project led the Oregon Legislature to reform the state's standards for hydroelectric permits, and induced the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to interpret away NMFS's ability to prescribe binding conditions on projects qualifying for exemptions from federal licenses. FERC's failure to satisfy NEPA requirements caused the project to shut down in December 1985. The authors make detailed recommendations as to how the federal program authorizing small hydroelectric projects can comply with NEPA. They argue that federal and state fishery agencies should insist the Winchester project not restart until FERC prepares an environmental impact statement on the effects of the project and a proposed replacement dam on the North Umpqua's anadromous fish runs."
