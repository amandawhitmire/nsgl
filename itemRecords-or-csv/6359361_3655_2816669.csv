15,Abstract:,"Extensive hypoxic areas form each summer in the northern Gulf of Mexico. To assess hypoxia's impact on trophic interactions in the northern Gulf, we sampled fish inside and outside of hypoxic areas during late-July and early August in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Fish were collected using bottom and midwater trawls with CTD casts being made before each trawl to determine temperature, DO, salinity, and depth. 5,100 fish diets from 73 species were examined. Non-metric multidimensionaâ€‹l scaling analysis was conducted on individuals with non-empty stomachs and species with n > 15 individuals with non-empty stomach, and was used to identify general patterns in diets in relation to biotic and abiotic factors, including hypoxia. Diets of individuals within a species were generally more similar within than among species. Within species, individual diet differences were primarily influenced by fish size and then by DO. Additional work will be done to determine whether the effects of DO increase or decrease individual consumption rates, and will attempt to resolve the mechanism for these effects."
