12,Abstract:,"Coastal waters, lakes and streams in the U.S. provide a variety of seafoods, including salmon and many other fish, clams, oysters, shrimp, and crab. These delicacies can be enjoyed throughout the year if they are preserved when supplies are abundant. Canning is the method of preservation commonly used. Seafoods are high in quality and safe to eat when canned correctly. This brochure tells you how to do that."
