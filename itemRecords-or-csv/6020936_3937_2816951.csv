9,Abstract:,"The natural products of four temperate marine red algae (Rhodophyta) and one tropical marine blue green alga (Cyanophyta) have been isolated and defined by derivatization, degradation and spectroscopic analysis. The red alga Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis yielded three categories of compounds which included ten oxylipins, three unprecedented galactolipids and two novel pyrroles. The major oxylipin, 12(R), 13(S)-diHEPE, is an inhibitor of progesterone production in the sheep corpus luteum and appears to be the product of a hydroperoxide isomerase which acts on 12(S)-HPETE. The three galactolipids are the first example of MGDAG and DGDAG with specifically oxidized acyl groups, which indicates that this form of galactolipids may serve as either the storage of 12(R), 13(S)-diHEPE or the products of a lipoxygenase system that use eicosapentaenoi​c acid-containing galactolipids as substrates. The red alga Polyneura latissima produces five eicosanoids. Unlike the red algae G. lemaneiformis, Murrayella periclados and Constantinea simplex, which contain 12-lipoxygenase systems, Polyneura latissima may contain a 9-lipoxygenase system as indicated by the oxygenation pattern of the isolated eicosanoids. The eicosanoid chemistry of another red alga Rhodymenia pertusa is different from all others. The five compounds detected from this alga seem to be the products of a 5-​R-​lipoxygenase which includes 5(R), 6(S)-diHETE, 5(R*)-HETE and 5,12-diHETE. The tropical marine cyanobacterium Hormothamnion enteromorphoide​s produces a suite of cytotoxic and antimicrobial cyclic peptides. The structure of the most lipophilic of these, hormothamnin A, was determined by interpretation of physical data, principally high field NMR and FAB MS, in combination with chemical derivitization and degradation schemes to possess a cyclo-​(D-​PHE-​D-​LEU-​L-​ILE-​D-​allo-​ILE-​ L-​LEU-​GLY-​D-​BAOA-​L-​HSER-​DHHA-​L-​HYPRO-​L-​HSER) structure."
