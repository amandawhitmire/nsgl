13,Abstract:,Estimating the force coefficients for the two-term Morison equation for a cylinder in waves depends on accurately measuring the amplitudes and phase shifts between the kinematics of the ambient wave and the wave-induced force. A regression analysis is used to develop an algorithm that illustrates both the parametric dependency of the data on the Dean eccentricity parameter and the variability of these force coefficients if incorrect amplitudes or phase shifts are introduced into the analysis.
