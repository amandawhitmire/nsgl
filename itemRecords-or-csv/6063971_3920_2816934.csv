11,Abstract:,"Piscirickettsia salmonis is a rickettsial pathogen of salmonid fish (Fryer, Lannan, Giovannoni & Wood 1992). It causes the disease piscirickettsio​sis, and is the first rickettsial agent to be implicated in the aetiology of a major fish disease. Piscirickettsio​sis has had a substantial economic impact on the salmonid aquaculture industry of southern Chile. It was first observed there in coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch (Walbaum), held in salt water (Bravo & Campos 1989), and since that time epizootics have predictably occurred at seawater sites in the spring and autumn of the year, when water temperatures are ca 9-16 deg C. However, there is only one report of piscirickettsio​sis in fresh water (Bravo 1994). Piscirickettsio​sis affects all species of salmonids cultured in salt water in southern Chile. In addition to coho salmon, affected fish include rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), and both chinook, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum), and Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. A disease, indistinguishab​le from piscirickettsio​sis, occurs in a chronic form among salmonids cultured at seawater sites in western Canada (Evelyn 1992), in Ireland (Rodger & Drinan 1993) and in Norway (Olsen, Speilberg, Melby & Hastein 1993). The P. salmonis type strain, LF-89 (Fryer et al. 1992), was isolated from a moribund coho salmon collected at a seawater netpen in southern Chile during an epizootic that produced extensive mortality (Fryer, Lannan, Garces, Larenas & Smith 1990). The in vitro characterizatio​n of P. salmonis (Fryer et al. 1990), and elements of the histopathology associated with piscirickettsio​sis (Cvitanich, Garate & Smith 1991) have been described."
