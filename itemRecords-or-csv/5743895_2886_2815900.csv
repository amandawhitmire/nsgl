12,Abstract:,"Contingent valuation is used to measure the social impacts of tourism in rural Oregon communities. Impacts are substantial, for example, annual household willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce traffic congestion is $186. Study features included tests of sensitivity to a change in scope, tests of stability across survey mode, and a thorough system of ""no""-vote follow-up questions in a referendum format. Results indicate that conclusions regarding sensitivity to scope may be dependent on the test used. WTP estimates are substantially less with the mail versus telephone survey mode."
