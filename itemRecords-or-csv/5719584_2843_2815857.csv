13,Abstract:,"The 'tragedy of the commons' argument predicts the overexploitatioâ€‹n of resources held in common. There is a great deal of evidence to the contrary. The accuracy and validity of six predicates of the argument are examined. These involve individual motivations, characteristics of individuals, nature of institutional arrangement, interactions among users, the ability of users to create new arrangements, and the behavior of regulatory authorities. The tragedy of the commons argument is seriously incomplete. It needs to be replaced by a richer and more accurate framework."
