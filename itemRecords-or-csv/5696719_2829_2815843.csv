13,Abstract:,"Marine macroalgae are a rich and diverse source of natural products, including pharmacological​ly active eicosanoids. Cell and tissue cultures have the potential to biosynthesize these metabolites in controlled cultivation systems. Unfortunately, the development of cell and tissue culture systems for the anatomically complex brown macroalgae are not well developed. An approach for developing axenic cell cultures from marine plants, adapted from techniques for terrestrial plant cell and tissue culture, involves the induction of undifferentiate​d callus tissue from sterilized explants of the intact plant, followed by dispersion and culture of the callus cells as a liquid cell suspension. The objective of this study is to determine the kinetics of non-​photosynthetic, callus-like tissue formation from stipe explants of the cold-water brown alga ""Laminaria setchellii"". Although the production of non- photosynthetic, callus-like tissue is described here, the long-term goal is to develop liquid cell suspension cultures from the genus ""Laminaria"". Three species, ""L. setchellii"", ""L. saccharina"", and ""L. sinclairii"", are known to produce pharmacological​ly active 15- lipoxygenase eicosanoids."
