11,Abstract:,"Commercial fishermen, accustomed to the fluctuations of supply and demand, often look for new ways to market their catch. Some consider selling directly from their boat, truck or small roadside stand. This brochure lays out the requirements of the many state and local agencies that regulate consumer sales, and describes how fishermen can comply with those requirements."
