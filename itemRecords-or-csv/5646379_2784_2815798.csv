11,Abstract:,"A bacterium (Strain CA2) that enhances survival and growth of larvae of the oyster ""Crassostrea gigas"" was used in a series of experiments to determine the occurrence of bacterivory in straight-hinged bivalve larvae. Size and carbon content of this bacterium was within the range reported for naturally occurring marine bacteria. Unattached, motile CA2 cells were readily captured and ingested by oyster larvae and were seen to accumulate in larval digestive systems. Retention of carbon by axenic oyster larvae, fed either 14C-labelled live or heat-killed bacteria in 'pulse-chase' feeding experiments, demonstrates the endogenous ability of larvae to digest and assimilate bacterial carbon."
