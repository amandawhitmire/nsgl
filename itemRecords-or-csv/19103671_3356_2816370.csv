11,Abstract:,"Use this comprehensive species module for an in-depth understanding of Asian carp. Modules include a comprehensive species guide, a species-​at-​a-​glance fact sheet, a related lesson plan, suggested activies, comprehension questions, and videos and related on-line resources. Asian carps—fish in the Cyprinid family—have been part of our culture for centuries. We use them as ornamental aquarium fish (goldfish and koi) and food fish, and to help keep aquaculture ponds clean. However, when Asian carps escape into natural waterways, they can cause big problems for human health, the economy, and the environment. Four species of Asian carps have escaped in the United States and are of concern: grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp, and black carp."
