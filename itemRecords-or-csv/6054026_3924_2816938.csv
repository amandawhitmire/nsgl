14,Abstract:,"The amounts of by-products generated from processing aquatic foods and the volumes of underutilized by-catch, discards, and low-value fish are staggering. At the same time, overfishing of several species is a common problem. Aquaculture has experienced great growth during the past 25 years, filling the supply gap that cannot be provided using natural resources. However, the environmental impact of this industry is beginning to slow its growth. It appears that the only great opportunity is to improve fish processing so as to better utilize existing resources. The new technology of isoelectric precipitation and solubilization of fish muscle proteins with concurrent separation of fish oil for the processing of by-product provides a great opportunity on a large scale. In the particular case of the surimi industry, the new technology based on using natural polymeric complexes for the treatment of process water offers an opportunity to alleviate its environmental impact, freshwater use, and low yield limitations. In addition to basic research on recovering valuable fractions, it is necessary to develop applications for the recovered products. Government agencies, industry, and academia must collaborate in this effort."
