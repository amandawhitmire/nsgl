11,Abstract:,"Metacercariae of the trematode ""Stephanostomum​"" sp. commonly parasitize rex sole off Oregon, primarily in the musculature at the base of the fins. Each metacercaria is surrounded by a cyst of parasite origin and by a host reaction of varying intensity. In most fish studied, the host response was limited and appeared externally as a small white capsule. In some sole, the host reaction was massive, and macroscopic orange-colored capsules occurred around individual metacercariae. The range of histopathologic​al conditions is described. Differences in degree of host reaction may have been attributable to the age of the infection or to other factors."
