11,Abstract:,"The United States Commission on Ocean Policy (USCOP) made several recommendations pertaining to ecosystem-based ocean governance. Implementing these recommendations will require new laws, policies, and institutions and will involve consolidation of ocean and coastal programs and implementation of interagency ecosystem-based management approaches. The USCOP recommends that these structures be designed to promote innovation, learning, and adaptation as well as to realize full economic potential of the ocean's resources and accommodate ocean resource users. This paper outlines some institutional design problems inherent in this recommendation and describes a number of well-â€‹established institutional incentive problems, such as power ambiguity, failure to make credible commitments, low-intensive incentives, moral hazards, bounded rationality, and truncated learning. It presents Pacific salmon as an example of a complex governance structure that embodies the full range of incentive problems."
