14,Abstract:,"Protease enzymes in fish mince break down proteins and inhibit gelling. Enzyme inhibitors present their own disadvantages. This research investigated ohmic, or electrical resistive, heat generated internally due to the electrical resistance of the mince as an alternative to enzyme inhibitors. Results are described."
