11,Abstract:,"For four decades Oregon Sea Grant has been committed to marine education, and the Dean John A. Knauss Marine Policy fellowships occupy a unique niche in the program's educational portfolio. The one-year national fellowship provides a unique educational experience to students enrolled in graduate programs related to ocean and coastal resources and policy. The program matches outstanding students with hosts in legislative or executive branch offices located in the Washington, D.C. area. In the first quarter-century of our involvement with the fellowship, 31 students selected by Oregon Sea Grant were placed as Knauss fellows, a record of which we are proud. This Oregon Sea Grant retrospective profiles six of these former Oregon fellows and updates the current known affiliations of all. Additional essays round on this celebratory volume."
