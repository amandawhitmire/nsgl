9,Abstract:,"Important federal and state legislation, state court decisions, and regulatory agency programs support increased public access to shorelines and beaches, both publicly and privately owned. This paper examines alternative theories and approaches for increasing public access, especially the difficult taking issues presented where private property is involved. Techniques for reducing the significance of the taking issue are suggested."
