11,Abstract:,"A fish freezes over a range of temperatures from about 31 deg to 24 deg F. Partial freezing refers generally to an onboard refrigeration system that brings the fish to some temperature below 32 deg F, at which only a fraction of the water in the fish is frozen. Shelf life is longer than that of iced fish landed fresh, and ice-crystal damage to the cell walls of fish tissue is perhaps less than it would be after more complete freezing. A Canadian experiment in partial freezing showed that (1) the most significant factor affecting quality of loaded fish was handling before refrigeration; (2) the refrigerated seawater (RSW) system must be good enough to bring temperatures to 27 deg F in 24 hours; and (3) the operator must exclude air from the RSW mixture to minimize spoilage during transport."
