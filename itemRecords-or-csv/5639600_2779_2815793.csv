12,Abstract:,"The batch retort model developed uses a heat transfer equation for heat conduction in cylindrical cans, first order kinetics for microbial inactivation, first order kinetics for quality losses and a transient energy balance to estimate steam consumption. For a given retort, lethality process, and quality retention, the transient energy balance equation in the model allowed the identification of feasible time-​temperature profiles reducing energy consumption, total process time or both. In the examples analyzed and depending upon product specification, time-variable retort temperatures reduced process time by 18-55 min. These examples suggested that a change from constant to time-variable retort temperatures could increase canning capacity by 20-50%."
