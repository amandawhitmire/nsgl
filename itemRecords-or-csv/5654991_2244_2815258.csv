13,Abstract:,"Darkblotched rockfish ""Sebastes crameri"" are viviparous, as are other species of the genus ""Sebastes"", and have been an important component of the Oregon commerical groundfish trawl fishery. Previous investigators have expressed concern that the slow growth, low natural mortality, and variable recruitment associated with species of the genus ""Sebastes"" make them extremely vulnerable to overfishing. This paper describes an annual reproductive cycle (based on gross and cellular examination of ovary and testis morphology), size and age at sexual maturity, and fecundity of darkblotched rockfish off the coast of Oregon."
