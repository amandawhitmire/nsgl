11,Abstract:,"The Federal Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), whose main purpose is to preserve and protect the nation's coasta lzone, provides that the coastal states shall implement the purposes of the Act through the development of coastal zone managemenrt programs. To influence the states into full participation in the federal coastal program, Congress provided that when a state's management program has been approved by the Secretary of Commerce, thereafter all federal activities, projects, licenses, permits, and grants that significantly affect the coastal zone must be consistent with the state's program. There are some exceptions to this principle, discussed later, but generally, a state with an approved program (such as Oregon) is vested with power to decide what types of federal activities will be allowed in the coastal zone. Section 307 of the CZMA contains the consistency directives. There are five areas in which federal consistency with an approved state program is required: 1) federal agency activities significantly affecting the coastal zone; 2) federal agency development projects in the coastal zone; 3) federal licenses or permits to conduct an activity which significantly affects the coastal zone; 4) plans for the exploration, develoment, or production from an area leased under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act; and 5) federal assistance programs (grants) for proposed projects submitted by state or local governments which significantly affect the coastal zone. Section 307 has been fleshed out with regulations adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in March 1978. For each consistency area there are various issues to be discussed. Among these are: types of activities covered, who decides whether an activity is consistent, state review of the determination, conflict resolution between federal and state agency determinations, and exceptions to the consistency provisions."
