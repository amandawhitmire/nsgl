9,Abstract:,"Gray whales migrate north and south along the West Coast of America, 9,000 miles each year--day and night. Spending most of their lives within sight of land, giant grays have plied these shallow waters for at least as long as we are able to look back into history. Year after year we have watched them and yet we know so very little about them. A group of Oregon State University scientists have been studying these gray whales from their summer feeding ""grounds"" in the Bering, Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, to their calving lagoons in Baja, Mexico. By using compact radio transmitters, shore-based monitoring stations, and airplane-â€‹mounted radio receivers, these scientists have learned much about whale movements, diving patterns and behavior. ""Gray Whale"" is a filmed documentation of their work. The eight-minute film report is designed for those with a scientific interest in tag design and in the remote monitoring process."
