12,Abstract:,"In this report the authors describe the results of the polyenoic fatty acid isomerase (PFI) catalyzed isomerization of a broad range of alternative substrates. Based on detailed structural analysis of the product from reaction with docosahexaenoic acid, the development of a conjugated diene from reaction with dihono-​gamma-​linolenic acid, and analysis of the kinetic parameters of PFI with several other fatty acid substrates, the authors hypothesize that the enzyme orients the substrate in the catalytic pocket with respect to the methyl terminus and that it likely reacts, preferentially, with the protonated form of the substrate."
