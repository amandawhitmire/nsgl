15,Abstract:,"The threat of a potential major Tsunami event on the Oregon coast has drawn regional government’s attentions on the communities’ disaster preparedness, resilience and recovery. This emerging public issue also calls for an increase of collaboration among research institute, university extension and local policy makers. This presentation will propose an Economic-​Engineering model to improve estimations of both direct and indirect economic losses1 after a potential major tsunami event. The model’s framework of integrating physical damages and direct economic losses at tax-lot level is first introduced. Then, economic drives at county level and sub-county level are compared to show the disproportional​ly distribution economic activities and inter-regional trade between inside and outside of disaster-​affected zone within the county, which is revealed in the Economic-​Engineering model. Last, we uses a wood processing facility located in Clatsop County inland to step-by-step display how direct economic losses inside disaster-​affected zone will affected businesses inland through economic transactions. This proposal will demonstrate the following improvements using the Economic-​Engineering model for impact assessment: a). It provides a high-​resolution, more accurate estimation of physical damage and direct economic losses. b). It identifies the different economic drivers between inside and outside of disaster-​affected zone within the county to help targeting vulnerable sectors. c). Using the sub-county economic transaction information, the model provides a more accurate assessment of indirect economic losses."
