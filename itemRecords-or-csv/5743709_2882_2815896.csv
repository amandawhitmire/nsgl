11,Abstract:,"""Piscirickettsiâ€‹a salmonis"" is the first of the previously unrecognized rickettsial pathogens of fish to be fully characterized. Since then, the impact of rickettsial pathogens in fish has become increasingly apparent. The source, reservoir, and mode of transmission of these agents as well as appropriate methods of disease prevention and control remain to be established."
