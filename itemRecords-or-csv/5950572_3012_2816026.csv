15,Abstract:,"A new and improved NMR experiment for F1 scalable ""J""- Resolved HMBC is presented here. This experiment, called ""J""-​IMPEACH-​MBC, utilizes a minimum number of 180 deg. pulses to preserve maximum signal-to-noise ratio and provides a variable scaling factor that can be used to scale the heteronuclear couplings in F1. It should prove to be useful for the determination of relative stereochemistry and other structural problems. In addition, a description of the advantages of the ""J""-IMPEACH-MBC compared with the ""J""-Resolved HMBC-2 is presented. The method is exemplified with strychnine."
