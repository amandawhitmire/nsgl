11,Abstract:,"A survey for Manayunkia speciosa, the freshwater polychaete host for the myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa shasta, was conducted from 2003 to 2005 as part of an integrated study of the epizootiology of ceratomyxosis in Klamath River salmonids. Substrata samples (n = 257) were collected in a variety of habitats from Klamath Lake to the mouth of the Klamath River to document occurrence and relative abundance of the polychaete by habitat type and to estimate the prevalence of C. shasta within selected polychaete populations. Populations of M. speciosa were identified throughout the Klamath River within pools (51.6%), eddy-pools (47.0%), and runs (40.0%). Large populations of M. speciosa were consistently found at the inflow to the main-stem reservoirs where densities were correlated with distance from the inflow into the reservoir. Using polymerase chain reaction assay and composite samples, 12 of 71 populations identified were tested for C. shasta, revealing a mean infection prevalence of 0.27%. An area of elevated infection prevalence (4.9 and 8.3%) was identified with 2 populations below a barrier to salmonid migration, which explains the high infectious spore densities demonstrated in concurrent studies and observations of C. shasta-induced mortality in Klamath River fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)."
