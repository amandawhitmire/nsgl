11,Abstract:,"Oregon has one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world, but whether you're an experienced boater or a novice, remember that Oregon's coastal bars can be hazardous. River and tidal currents, ocean swells, and wind can create perilous conditions at coastal river entrances for vessels of all sizes. And weather and sea conditions can change very quickly. All these factors make good boat handling and knowledge of the local bar entrances a must for enjoying an ocean outing. This brochure is an excellent guide to safe coastal boating. It contains information on each of Oregon's coastal bars, including a photo and chart of the entrance. It also gives coastal boating information and references for more detailed study."
