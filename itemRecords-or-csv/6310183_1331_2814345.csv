13,Abstract:,"The challenge for ocean observing groups to provide meaningful and effective real-time data (RTD) products for non-defined user groups, such as the general public, is not straightforward as it is to provide products to well-defined end-user groups, like boaters and fishermen. Unanswered questions faced by the ocean observing community about the general public include a) are they interested in RTD, and b) if so, what format are they interested in interacting with? In Oregon, several organizations - including industry (WET Labs), science (Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing Systems (NANOOS)), and education (Oregon Sea Grant) - have formed a unique collaborative partnership to understand how to present and interpret water quality RTD for a science center audience through an interactive, computer-based exhibit. The exhibit interprets near-real time (NRT) data from Yaquina Bay, as collected by a Land/Ocean Biogeochemical Observatory (LOBO), to facilitate the general public's understanding and analytical thinking about natural variability within an estuary and provide them with information that allows them to make more informed decisions about their environment. We utilized an iterative, formative evaluation process of unobtrusive observations and interviews to guide exhibit modifications and to increase engagement by the audience. We will describe the design elements successful in creating relevance about salinity data, the importance of social motivation in visitor groups, and the challenge we still face in engaging the general public with NRT or RT ocean data."
