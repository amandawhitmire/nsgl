10,Abstract:,"This guide was written for watershed stewards-​-​people who own, manage, work, volunteer, or in some other way care for or depend upon a watershed. It also provides guidance for groups of people who have come together formally or informally to be guardians of a watershed. Three areas are covered in depth: creating successful groups; watershed science and monitoring; and evaluating, managing, and improving watershed functions."
