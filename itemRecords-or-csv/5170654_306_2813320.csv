11,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study is to document erosion during spring 1976, the second episode of severe erosion, and to contrast it with earlier winter erosion periods. As will be seen, a pronounced storm on Feb. 18, 1976 caused water to wash over the spit. Numerous beach drift logs were thrown atop the dunes. Such wash-overs have not been observed during other winter storms since 1970. Actual storm systems in the north Pacific will be examined to determine conditions that produce the exceptionally high waves on the Oregon coast that result in erosion. Consideration of the importance of tide levels and storm surges will be included in the analysis."
