12,Abstract:,"The study of sand mineralogy and grain rounding can help answer many questions of immediate concern to coastal engineers or to broader issues of beach preservation. The heavy-mineral contents of sands, together with statistical techniques such as factor analysis, can be used to delineate sediment sources, trace transport paths, and map out patterns of mixing during sediment dispersal. Variations in the degree of grain rounding can similarly be used to trace sand movements, or to obtain additional information concerning the history of the sediment particles. The techniques of studying sand mineralogies and grain rounding, and the types of problems they can address, are illustrated by research on the Oregon coast described in this paper."
