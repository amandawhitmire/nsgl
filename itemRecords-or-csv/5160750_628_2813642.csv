10,Abstract:,"This story is based on fact, even though the names are fictional, and incidents have been added in reconstructing the original news story. The list of what went wrong on the 12-meter combination boat named ""Starfisher"" may seem exaggerated (""Could all that happen?""), but sinkings more often than not are the result of a train of misfortunes or errors. Usually, only a few errors are enough to sink a boat - and when a defective lifeboat is added to the chain, no one returns to tell the story. So follow the trials of the Barrow brothers; maybe we can all learn from them... and save some lives in the future. KW: BOATING SAFETY"
