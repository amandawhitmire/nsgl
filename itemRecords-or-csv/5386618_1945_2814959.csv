13,Abstract:,"This paper describes an analytical approach to estimate ice quantities required by fishing vessels using slush ice or chilled seawater (CSW) systems. The calculations specify ice required for different hold sizes, catch volumes, and times at sea, under varying conditions of water temperature, hold insulation, and hold flooding strategy. Observations and measurements, recorded during four trips on three different steel salmon packers, were used to verify the procedure and support several recommendations for CSW system operation."
