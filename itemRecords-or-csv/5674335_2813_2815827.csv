10,Abstract:,"Fish cells are readily propagated in vitro using techniques and reagents developed for the culture of mammalian cells; more than 150 fish cell lines have been reported. Unlike cells of avian or mammalian origin, cultured fish cells require minimal maintenance, permit flexible culture schedules, and replicate within a broad range of incubation temperatures. These unique charactertisticâ€‹s make them useful tools for a variety of biological applications. Guidelines governing quality control in the fish cell laboratory fall into three categories: (1) manipulation of the cells, (2) controlling the quality of other elements of the culture system (i.e., media, reagents, and cultureware), and (3) controlling contamination."
