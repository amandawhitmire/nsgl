12,Abstract:,"Awareness of the complexity and delicacy of our estuarine environments continues to expand. The sensitivity of estuaries to man's abuses signals the need for better understanding of estuarine processes to prevent unintentional ruin. But the complexity of the estuary makes simplistic solutions unrealistic and detailed solutions difficult, The difficulties of the problem, of course, do not lessen the need for better answers and fresh approaches. The speakers at the Second Technical Conference on Estuaries of the Pacific Northwest, and their papers which follow, help fill that need. Several papers point out that estuaries are a social responsibility, requiring the cooperation of many individuals and the resolution of a multitude of conflicting interests. At the base of such cooperation and resolution is better understanding-​-​more hard facts--about how physical, chemical and biological attributes of estuaries interact Several papers provide better knowledge of estuarine ecosystems; several others, better knowledge of the physical properties of estuaries. Such knowledge is prerequisite to intelligent management of our estuarine and coastal areas."
