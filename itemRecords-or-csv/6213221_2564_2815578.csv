10,Abstract:,"This research highlights the variability in natural marshes' capacity to support juvenile salmon. The author studied juvenile Chinook diet and prey resources, and modeled growth potential in 10 natural marshes and 1 recently restored marsh along the Oregon coast in 2003-04. Juvenile Chinook foraging patterns showed a wide variation among different sites. Although many diets showed a similar mix of species, dominated by Corophium spp. and chironomids, Chinook at a few sites fed almost entirely on prey that was rarely found elsewhere. Although among emergent marshes, prey resource composition appeared to be similar, scrub-shrub marshes tended to have large numbers of collembolans. Both species richness and abundance were lowest early in the season. The bioenergetics model showed differences of greater than an order of magnitude among marshes and in the same marsh over time. Emergent marshes with a lower surface elevation had the highest average growth potentials, followed by high emergent and scrub-shrub marshes."
