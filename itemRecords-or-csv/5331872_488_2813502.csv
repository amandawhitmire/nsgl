10,Notes:,Report 4: The development of petroleum resources from the Outer Continental Shelf: Legal management problems and capabilities in Oregon
11,Abstract:,"This report was prepared by James B. Buck of the University of Oregon Ocean Resources Law Program. It is one of a series of reports to the Governor's Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Development Task Force on legal issues associated with the development of petroleum resources and associated facilities. It is intended for the use of the members of the Task Force and other interested persons. Specific views and recommendations are those of the author and not necessarily the views of the Task Force, the Department of Land Conservation and Development, or other persons who provided assistance or information. Pipelines ruknning from the outer continental shelf, crossing state owned submerged lands, and terminating at alandfall on the shore present diverse issues for coastal planning agencies. Environmental impacts range from chronic leakage problems to siting of onshore facilities such as tank farms or refineries. Jurisdictional complexities abound; within the three mile territorial sea the state has primary authority over pipelines, but on the outer continental shelf (OCS), the U.S. Departments of Interior, Transportation, and Energy are all involved in pipeline regulation. This paper shall discuss some of the environmental consequences of offshore pipelines, and attempt to explain the regulatory functions of the various agencies involved."
