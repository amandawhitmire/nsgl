12,Abstract:,"Exhibit: The core of the Augmented Reality Sandbox is the software which creates the topographic overlay and water simulation. It utilizes the Kinect camera’s infrared (IR) sensors to “map” the movement of the sand in real time and then passes that data on to the computer, where it is processed and projected onto the sand surface. The water flow is based on real-world equations, which can be adjusted to represent many different fluids such as water, lava or snow. Many other parts of the software are adjustable, which allows users to create scenarios to explore bathymetry, volcanoes, tsunamis, and much more."
