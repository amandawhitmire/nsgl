13,Abstract:,"As part of an effort to develop practical technologies for immunizing fish against viral pathogens, the parameters that govern gene expression by direct DNA injection in fish were examined. In this study, the firefly luciferase gene was used as the reporter gene for examining expression promoters, sites of gene expression, duration and level of gene expression, and the persistence of the plasmid DNA in rainbow trout. The information provided by the analysis is important to future work in developing vaccines and other products for fish."
