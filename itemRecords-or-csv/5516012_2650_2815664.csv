12,Abstract:,"The insulin release enhancer hepoxilin B3 is a 12-lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid that has been found in various mammalian tissues. Although lipoxygenase pathways are well documented in terrestrial plants, this lipoxygenase product has never been isolated from the plant kingdom. This paper reports the isolation of hepoxilin B3 from two plants, the tropical red marine algae ""Platysiphonia miniata"" and ""Cottoniella filamentosa."" Application of two-dimensional NMR methodology to the structural description of this algal natural product demonstrates the tremendous power of this technique in this chemical class."
