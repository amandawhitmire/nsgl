11,Abstract:,"This publication points out that ports can play a significant role in local economic development by persuading enterprises to relocate in the community, creating new enterprises, or helping existing enterprises to grow. The need for economic diversity and stability and the various quantitative methods for measuring economic growth are explained. Steps in planning for economic growth, including how to assess community resources (geographic location, natural and human resources); how to develop goals, objectives, and activities; and how to pursue enterprise opportunities are explored, along with the various mechanisms available to public ports to encourage economic development, such as tax exemptions, low cost loans, free services, etc."
