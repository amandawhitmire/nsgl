11,Abstract:,"In early studies to assess the therapeutic value of fish, often large doses (>15 g/d) of n-3 fatty acids supplied as the fish oil were used. Because it is the consumption of fish and not the use of fish oils that has been linked to decreased incidence of heart disease and because such high doses are impractical, dietary fish may provide a more attractive source of n-3 fatty acids. However, accurate dietary recommendations require the content of n-3 fatty acids in fish be known. The purpose of this study was to measure the total lipid and cholesterol content and fatty acid profile of chinook salmon, Dover sole, and sablefish caught off the coast of Oregon in late summer, 1987. For the fatter fish these values were considerably lower than the average values found in literature. Results demonstrate the need to increase the information available about seasonal variation in lipid content of finfish so that accurate dietary recommendations can be made."
