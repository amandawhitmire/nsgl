16,Abstract:,"Variable ocean conditions can greatly impact prey assemblages and predator foraging in marine ecosystems. The authors' goal was to better understand how a change in ocean conditions influenced dietary niche overlap among a suite of midtrophic-​level predators. They examined the diets of three fishes and one seabird off central Oregon during two boreal summer upwelling periods with contrasting El Niño (2010) and La Niña (2011) conditions. They found greater niche specialization during El Niño and increased niche overlap during La Niña in both the nekton and micronekton diet components, especially in the larger, more offshore predators. However, only the two smaller, more nearshore predators exhibited interannual variation in diet composition. Concurrent trawl surveys confirmed that changes in components of predator diets reflected changes in the prey community. Using multiple predators across diverse taxa and life histories provided a comprehensive understanding of food-web dynamics during changing ocean conditions."
