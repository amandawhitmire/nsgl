9,Abstract:,"This thesis is an account of investigation on the natural products deriving from various marine algae and has resulted in the discovery of eleven novel bioactive metabolites. Isolation and characterizatio​n of these new molecules were carried out using different chromatographic techniques and by analyses of different spectroscopic data, respectively. Using bioassay guided fractionation (brine shrimp toxicity assay), I isolated and identified five new, biologically active compounds [2 beta,3 alpha- epitaondiol, flabellinol, flabellinone, stypoaldehyde and stypohydroperox​ide], together with five known compounds [2- geranylgeranyl-​6-​methyl-​1,4-​benzoquinone, (-) epistypodiol, (-) stypoldione, fucoxanthin and iditol] from the marine brown alga Stypopodium flabelliforme, collected from Papua New Guinea. All of the new compounds were found to have cytotoxic activity (Ecg50 ranges from 0.8-10 ug/ ml) in human lung cancer (NCI-H460). 2 beta,3 alpha- epitaondiol and flabellinol exhibited strong sodium channel blocking activity (EC50 = 0.3 and 0.9 ug/ml, respectively). As a result of efforts to identify bioactive agents from marine algae, I have isolated and identified one new halogenated monoterpene [(-​)-​(5E,7Z)-​3,4,8-​trichloro-​7-​dichloromethyl-​3-​methyl-​ l,5,7-​octatriene] in addition to another three known halogenated monoterpene compounds from the red alga Plocamium cartilagineum collected from the eastern coast of South Africa. [(-)-(5E,7Z)- 3,4,8-​trichloro-​7-​dichloromethyl-​3-​methyl-​l,5,7-​octatriene] was found to be active as a cytotoxic agent in human lung caner (NCI- H460) and mouse neuro-2a cell lines (EC50 4 ug/ml). As part of continued search for bioactive secondary metabolites from marine sources using a bioassay guided fractionation approach (anti- trypanosome activity), I examined the organic extract of a Papua New Guinean collection of the green alga Udotea orientalis growing on a coral wall and collected in September 1998. Successive HPLC separations resulted in the isolation of three new compounds; (+) curcuepoxide A, (+) curcuepoxide B and (+)-​10a-​hydroxycurcudio​l. In addition I isolated four known compounds; (+)-​10/?-​hydroxycurcudio​l, (+) curcuphenol, (+) curcudiol and (+) curcudiol-​10-​one. A bioassay guided investigation approach (anti-Sirt2) of a Lyngbya majuscula collection from Key West Florida, led to the discovery of two novel bioactive natural products [(+)-​malyngamide X and one cyclic depsipeptide, (+)-​floridamide]. The new cyclic depsipeptide, (+)-floridamide contains four amino acids units beside the unique unit, 2,2-​dimethyl-​3-​hydroxyoctanoic acid (Dhoaa)."
