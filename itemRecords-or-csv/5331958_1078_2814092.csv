9,Abstract:,"The siting of energy facilities in the Oregon coastal zone presents a delicate question of balance: On the one hand is the notion of preserving the coast in its most natural, and thus most beautiful condition; whil on the other hand is the notion of utilizing available land to fulfill the state's obligation to provide Oregonians and others with sufficient numbers of energy facilities to meet their energy needs. Ecological, cultural, historic, and aesthetic values in the coastal zone are essential to the well-being of the people. Yet one of the national objectives is to attain a greater degree of energy self-​sufficiency. Due to the water-dependent and water-related nature of certain types of energy facilities, e.g., liquefield natural gas (LNG) marine terminals, it is a foregone conclusion that there will be energy facilities located in the coastal zone. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) is an attempt by the federal government to reconcile these, and other opposing concepts. Energy facilities significantly impact local, state, federal, and perhaps international interests. There are two levels of concern to be addressed. First is the question of whether an energy facility is to be located in the coastal zone, a question affecting all levels but with an important national significance. Second is the question of where such a facility will be located, a question with important local and state significance. This chapter encounters these two questions as they relate to the general siting of LNG facilities. It will discuss the development of LNG in Oregon as it is, or may be, affected by various important studies and reports, various statutory and regulatory schemes on the federal and state levels, and recent judicial and administrative decisions. It will conclude with recommendations for improvements in the Oregon Coastal Management Program and changes in the Oregon Revised Statutes."
