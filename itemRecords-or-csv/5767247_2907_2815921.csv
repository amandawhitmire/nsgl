12,Abstract:,Kinetic models of textural degradation of whiting surimi gel were developed using the Arrhenius equation to account for thermal log during heat-up periods. Kinetic models for textural properties were also readily obtained using an isothermal approach. Kinetic parameters obtained from either isothermal or nonisothermal approach were comparable. The models can be used to determine the optimal heating conditions that provide the desired textural properties of whiting surimi gel.
