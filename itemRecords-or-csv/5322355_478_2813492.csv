11,Abstract:,The Model TW-2A sea/air temperature system was developed by Oregon State University for the U. S. Coast Guard so that the Grays Harbor station can report local sea temperature via teletype to the National Weather Service forecast center for their use in making coastal weather forecasts. Sea and air temperature can also be displayed on the Harbor Videocable TV weather display at the station.
