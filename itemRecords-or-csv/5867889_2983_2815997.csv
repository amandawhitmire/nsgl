11,Abstract:,This study evaluated the influence of random sampling errors in fishery and survey data on the accuracy of a suite of estimates output by the age-structured version of the Stock Synthesis assessment program. The authors used Monte Carlo simulation techniques to generate fishery data with known characteristicsâ€‹. The random data sets were then analyzed using the Stock Synthesis program and estimates from Stock Synthesis were compared with the true values. There have been few published Monte Carlo evaluations of the Stock Synthesis program.
