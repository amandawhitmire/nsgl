13,Abstract:,"Plasma concentrations of testosterone, 17 ""alpha""-​hydroxy-​20""Beta""-​dihydroprogeste​rone (DHP), and estradiol-​17""beta"" were determined in hatchery populations of adult female coho salmon before and after the fish were injected with gonadotropin-​releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) to accelerate ovulation. Treatment with GnRHa significantly accelerated maturation over that observed in controls; however, a number of females did not ovulate for as long as 8 weeks after treatment. Testosterone was always higher before treatment in the early-ovulating fish and may be useful for predicting the sensitivity of coho salmon to GnRHa treatment for induced ovulation."
