17,Abstract:,"The Fishery Conservation and Management Act of l976 (FCMA) has turned out to be one of the most controversial. and confusing pieces of federal legislation in recent memory. The controversy is inevitable, but in this handbook we try to do something about the confusion. We hope that this book will communicate effectively to a broad range of readers, but especially to those who are most affected by the workings of the bureaucratic machine created by the FCMA. In drafting the various chapters, the authors tried to keep two hypothetical readers in mind. One is a commercial fisherman, a person whose livelihood is directly regulated by the FCMA. The main text of each chapter was written with this reader in mind. The other hypothetical reader is a lawyer with no special training in fisheries law but who may be confronted with fisheries management problems through his clients. The notes at the end of each chapter, which contain citations to authorities and occasional, further explanation, are written for this reader. Of course, the fact that we limited our list of imagined readers to two was a drafting device only; our goal is to provide useful information and analysis to seafood processors, fisheries managers, legislators, the interested public, and all sorts of people who are neither fishermen nor lawyers."
