13,Abstract:,"Fish immunomodulatin​g factors that appear closely related to their mammalian counter-parts have been described for a variety of species. However, there have been only a few reports of the isolation of genes for these factors from fish, and no cytokine genes have been identified for salmonids. The authors of this report describe the cloning and sequence analysis of a natural killer enhancing factor- like gene from rainbow trout. The cloned gene resembles two closely related human genes that encode cytosolic proteins expressed in both human red blood cells and the natural killer-​sensitive erythroleukemic cell line K562."
