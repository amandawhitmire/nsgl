11,Abstract:,"The effectiveness of resource management is widely discussed. Sustainability and ecosystem health are two dimensions upon which the effect of management is judged. The authors look at the impact of management on fish and forest resources by taking a life cycle approach to the exploitation of natural capitol. The approach is applied to the renewal cycle of a fishery and a forestry in the Pacific Northwest. In these examples, 90% of the natural capitol is lost or projected to be lost over a century and a half of exploitation. Based on these examples, resource management does not seem to lead to sustainability or ecosystem health."
