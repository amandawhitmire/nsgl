13,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus of economic importance as a pathogen of salmon and trout. Once confined to the Pacific Northwest, the virus is now enzootic in Japan and has also been observed in the eastern U.S., Taiwan, Italy, and France. This virus is responsible for substantial yearly losses of young fish at hatcheries in North America. Virus isolants from sockeye and chinook salmon and rainbow trout may exhibit different degrees of virulence. In this study the virulence and pathogenesis of 3 of the most commonly encountered strains of IHNV are compared in rainbow trout."
