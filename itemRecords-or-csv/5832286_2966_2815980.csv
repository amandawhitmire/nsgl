11,Abstract:,"This paper describes the development of a rapid, inexpensive method of diagnosing the source of fecal pollution in water. Previously, the authors identified ""Bacteroides-â€‹Prevotella"" ribosomal DNA (rDNA) PCR markers based on analysis. These markers, length heterogeneity PCR, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism distinguish cow from human feces. In this study, they recovered 16S rDNA clones from natural waters that were close phylogenetic relatives of the markers. From the sequence data, designed specific PCR primers that discriminate human and ruminant sources of fecal contamination."
