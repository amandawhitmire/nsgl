12,Abstract:,"Mariculture in Alaska is a growing industry with lots of economic potential for the state. Farmers like Meta Mesdag of the Salty Lady Seafood Company are working hard to bring world-class Alaska-grown shellfish straight from the farm to your table. In this first installment of Alaska Sea Grant’s “Meet Your Alaskan Farmer” series, Meta shares her experience as an oyster farmer in Alaska, and takes us through the process, from growing oysters from spat to delivering them to customers. Meta grew up near Portland, Oregon, and her husband is from Juneau. They met during college, and in 2012 moved to Juneau with their two young sons, welcoming a daughter shortly afterward. After years of running a portrait photography business in Oregon and Juneau, she decided to try something new, and in 2018 started the Salty Lady Seafood Company. Salty Lady Seafood is a true family business. Her kids spend summers and spare time during the school year helping on the farm, learning where their food comes from, and, Meta hopes, helping build something in which they too can feel a sense of ownership."
