8,Abstract:,"At the request of Oregon fishermen, Oregon Sea Grant convened a multi-​stakeholder working group in May, 2017 (Oregon Whale Entanglement Working Group). The primary goal of the working group is to develop short- and long-term options for reducing the risk of whale entanglements in Dungeness crab and other fixed gear to ensure thriving and resilient fisheries in Oregon and along the entire west coast. All working group meetings are open to the public, with priority given to working-group member contributions during discussions. Time is reserved for public input at each meeting. Most working-group meetings will take place in Newport, Oregon. Agendas are also included for the September 22, October 20, and October 25, 2017 meetings."
