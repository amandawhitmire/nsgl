10,Abstract:,"We inform that one pathway of introduction for invasive species is through the release of unwanted plants and animals into the environment by petowners, teachers, gardeners, or others who no longer wish to keep the plants and animals they own. We encourage not to release native species as well, because they may carry diseases that other native individuals are susceptible to. To promote our message of “Donʻt Let it Loose,” we invited students and educators to become part of the solution and to help spread the word. Through the use of a statewide High School Media Contest, both audiences are able to learn more about our message, and creatively develop materials that help build awareness within the Oregon community to not release unwanted animals and plants into the environment. Furthermore, an opportunity to learn the importance of invasive species prevention, and identifying other pathways of introduction is created."
