13,Abstract:,"Despite there being a suitable climate for mangroves in Hawaii, the extreme geographic isolation of the Hawaiian Archipelago meant that there were no native mangroves on the islands prior to 1902, when propagules of the red mangrove, Rhizophora mangle, were introduced from Florida to Molokai to help stabilize coastal mudflat erosion. Mangroves now occupy 1500km2 on the island of O'ahu. The success of R. mangle on O'ahu has begun to create problems for local wildlife, and has led to mangroves being removed around the coast. Typical removal practices include cutting down of the above-sediment tree, but leaving the fibrous root mat in place, which is rich in tannins and potentially toxic to a number of benthic organisms. Little data is available concerning benthic ecosystem functioning in Hawaii's mangroves forests, and to the best of our knowledge no data exists on the effects of the removal strategy employed in Hawaii on benthic ecosystem recovery. We used isotopic tracer experiments to analyze benthic ecosystem functioning in sediments from 5 sites: an invasive mangrove forest, where mangroves were removed 2 and 6 years ago, and mangrove-free control sites along the coastline of O'ahu. The study showed that the invasion of R. mangle has led to a major ecosystem shift with C-cycling in mangrove sediments being channelled almost exclusively though bacteria in contrast to mangrove-​removal and control environments, where macrofauna are the most important agents for C-cycling. Although the study highlighted that the relative importance of macrofauna and bacteria to C-cycling had recovered 6 yr after mangrove removal, foodweb structure and rates of C-turnover by both macrofauna and bacteria had not recovered to conditions characteristic of un-invaded sand-flats, emphasizing that the current mangrove removal strategy hinders benthic ecosystem recovery for many years after removal as a result of the continued impacts from the remaining root-fibre biomass."
