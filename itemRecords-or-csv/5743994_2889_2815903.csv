18,Abstract:,"There are four basic formulations currently used in vaccines: live attenuated vaccines, whole inactivated (killed) vaccines, purified subunits (proteins or glycoproteins) of the pathogen, and purified proteins produced from cloned genes. A fifth strategy, that of expressing viral genes in live vectors or plasmid DNA, has not yet produced a vaccine available for general use in any animal; but there are several of these vaccines in the licensing pipeline for both veterinary and human use. This review of fish vaccines is restricted to those consisting of protein subunits produced from cloned genes and genetic vaccines, i.e. those vaccines that result in the expression of viral genes in the host cells themselves. In addition, some of biotechnologicaâ€‹l approaches taken to increase the efficacy of these vaccines with adjuvants are considered along with delivery systems designed to induce cellular or humoral immunity."
