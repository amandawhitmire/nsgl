13,Abstract:,"Hosted by Oregon Sea Grant, this webinar is for students in grades 6-12 who want to explore careers in marine science. Tim Miller-Morgan describes procedures he performs as an aquatic veterinarian with Oregon Sea Grant and the Oregon State University Extension Service. He also talks about his global travels, including to Japan, where he has helped the koi industry, and Brazil, where he helps people who catch and sell ornamental fish from an Amazonian river. Tim teaches at OSU's Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine and at the Oregon Coast Community College. He also takes care of the animals at the  Oregon Coast Aquarium and the Hatfield Marine Science Center Visitor Center. Looking back to his childhood, Tim describes how the book ""All Creatures Great and Small"" inspired him to become a veterinarian. Michael Moses describes his journey to his job as the rocky shores coordinator for the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development, the state's chief land use regulator. The former English major also talks about how a biology class in college inspired him to go  into science. Michael went on to earn a bachelor's degree from OSU's department of fisheries and wildlife in 2009 and a master's in marine resource management in 2019 from OSU's College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences. For those interested in a career in science, Michael offers tips that include: have perseverance, say yes to opportunities that come along, and don't strive for perfection. He concludes his talk by explaining what ocean acidification is and why it's a problem. Lindsay Carroll, who coordinates Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program, serves as a moderator on this webinar, which was recorded on June 10, 2020."
