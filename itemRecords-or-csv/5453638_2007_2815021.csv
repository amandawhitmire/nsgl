14,Abstract:,"After a respite of more than a half a century, the mining of valuable metals in marine sands of the Pacific Northwest is once again of national and commercial interest. Those most sought-after are called placer sands, and they are characterized by above-average concentrations of heavy minerals and precious metals. However, interest has shifted from coastal sands, originally mined for gold, to offshore sands of the continental shelf. Marine placers enriched in the heavy minerals ilmenite, chromite, and zircon occur in coastal and shelf deposits of the geologically active Cascadia margin. The economic and strategic metals titanium, chromium, and zirconium are incorporated into these inert heavy minerals and concentrated in the sands of the nearshore region. Diminishing reserves have stimulated interest elsewhere in the exploration of the continental shelf for domestic supplies of these metals."
