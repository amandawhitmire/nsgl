18,Abstract:,"The purpose of the Western Regional Panel is to coordinate ANS efforts in western North America to help limit the introduction, spread and impacts. The spread of invasive species has caused significant economic and ecological problems throughout North America raising concerns for western aquatic ecosystems and water delivery systems. This report documents these activities from 2011-2019."
19,,"The WRP’s Building Consensus in the West Workgroup was a multi-year process to facilitate an ongoing discussion among State ANS Coordinators and the National Park Service to produce science-​based standard protocols and procedures for preventing the further spread of zebra and quagga mussels in the west via recreational watercraft, in tandem with the development of a legal framework for watercraft inspection and decontamination​ programs. The overarching purpose of BC, and the resulting actions and work products, was to achieve greater consistency among western state agencies implementing watercraft inspection and decontamination​ for zebra and quagga mussels both in management practices and with respect to legal parameters. The idealized target was to have common capabilities among and between managin​g entities to accomplish the overarching objectives of (1) achieving maximum resource protection against ZQM and other ANS, (2) providing optimal customer service to outdoor recreationists ​ by gaining consistency in requirements across the west for the boating public, and (3) increasing efficiencies and effectiveness of ANS programs. Although BC discussions took place in several forums and different venues over the years, the dialogue focused primarily on coordination and collaboration among states and NPS. Participants recognized the importance of other federal and state coordination and cooperation interests, as well as working with local governments, tribes, and private industry to achieve these broad objectives."
