12,Abstract:,"Three new chlorinated and carbocyclic oxylipins as well as one olefin analog were isolated from the temperate brown alga ""Egregia menziesii"" along with the previously reported ecklonialactone​s A, B and E. A biogenesis of the egregiachloride​s is proposed which is initiated by lipoxygenation followed by cyclization and termination by chloride of an omega3 carbocation."
