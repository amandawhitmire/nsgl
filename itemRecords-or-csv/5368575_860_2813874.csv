14,Abstract:,"The authors explore ways for improving the efficiency of container terminal operations, examining three important aspects of such a shipping operation: the height of incoming container stacks, the computer-​assisted planning of container ship loads, and the development of a simulation model for a transtainer-​based container terminal. The simulation model is subsequently utilized to examine the advantages of ordering the containers prior to the actual loading operation."
