10,Abstract:,"Freezing fish aboard ship is a common practice, In fact, aboard many large catcher/process​or vessels that make long trips at sea, it is a necessity. But it is also beginning to be somewhat common among many smaller U.S. vessels - blast freezing aboard Gulf of Mexico shrimpers, brine freezing aboard West Coast albacore trollers, and blast and contact freezing aboard West Coast salmon trollers. Keywords: Seafood Processing; Refrigeration."
