11,Abstract:,"Efforts of the past several years to describe new natural products from marine sources have led to the discovery that many red algae produce eicosanoid-like substances. This includes the known lipoxygenase metabolites [12-(S)-HETE] and hepoxillin B3 which were previously identified only as the result of animal metabolism. Recently, three novel oxidized fatty acids were identified in the red alga ""Farlowia mollis."" Further work with another red alga, ""Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis,"" led to isolation of two novel galactosyldiacy​lglycerols with regio- and stereo-​specifically oxidized fatty acids as novel acyl components. following derivatization and chromatography, the extract from this alga yielded three novel fatty acid derivatives in addition to derivatives of seven known compounds."
