10,Abstract:,"The roles of military submarines have evolved throughout the twentieth century. The nature of the submarine and the experiences of two world wars have led to some modifications of traditional law, particularly regarding the submarine's role as commerce raider. The U. S. Navy's new 'Commander's Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations' is, for the most part, an accurate reflection of current law. However, two large matters remain bothersome. (1) The 'Handbook' seldom distinguishes clearly between rules that apply in total wars and a war that is limited in geographical scale or objectives or both. (2) The rules that attempt to balance military necessity and humanitarianism are many and complex, and the 'Handbook' could benefit from inclusion of a set of presumptions designed to guide decision in doubtful cases."
