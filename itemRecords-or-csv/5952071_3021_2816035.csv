13,Abstract:,"A new NMR experiment is presented for the detection of intact 13C-15N units in biosynthetic studies. It use is demonstrated through a feeding experiment utilizing [2- 13C,15N)gylcine which confirmed the origin of the thiazole ring in the marine cyanobacterial metabolite as originating from cystein."
