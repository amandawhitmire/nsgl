14,Abstract:,This report is a summary review of the progress and evolution of the Oregon State University Sea Grant College Program from 1968-1983. It is not a historical document in the sense that all occurrences are chronicled. We have attempted to distill and report that which appears significant and to explain how we have matured to the program which exists today.
