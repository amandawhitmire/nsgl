14,Abstract:,"Capacitive (Radio Frequency) dielectric heating has great potential for achieving rapid and uniform heating in foods, providing safe, high quality food products. This review describes and discusses the major technology behind capacitive dielectric heating in food processing and preservation, the current applications of the technology in the industry, the potential use of mathematical modeling for heating system design, and the major challenges facing the use of this technology in food processing. A vast amount of work is still necessary to further understand the dielectric properties of both food and packaging materials in order to refine system design and maximize performance of this technology in the field of packaged food products."
