11,Abstract:,"This paper examines the impacts of extended fisheries jurisdiction on trade in seafood products among selected North and South American, African, European and Asian countries. A market shares approach examines the role of non-price competition on seafood markets, and is used to improve understanding of the growth (or decline) of Canadian and U.S. fish exports in selected markets, both prior to and since extended fisheries jurisdiction. Then, an econometric model is used to estimate the elasticities of substitution in demand for imports from competing countries. The model permits intertemporal and interregional differences in elasticities to be identified and analyzed."
