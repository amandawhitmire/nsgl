7,Abstract:,"Since 2002, Humboldt squid numbers have been increasing in Oregon waters. In their southern range they eat hake, anchovies, sardines, rockfish, market squid, and other species. Researchers at Oregon State University, in collaboration with Oregon fishermen, are studying the Humboldt squid to determine its diet, location, and reasons for expanding into Oregon waters."
