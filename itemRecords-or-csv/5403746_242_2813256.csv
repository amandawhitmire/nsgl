12,Abstract:,"This symposium was conducted to inquire about the possibility of developing a squid fishery in the Pacific Northwest, particularly with respect to handling and marketing the creature once it's caught. Among the topics covered were basic squid biology, existing squid fisheries in Japan and elsewhere, fishing gear and techniques, and handling and processing (including automation). Insuring orderly development of the Oregon squid fishery was the subject of a panel discussion. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. Squid distribution, biology and life history. Kathy Jefferts pp. 3-10. 2. East coast squid fisheries. Warren Rathjen pp. 11-22. 3. An overview of California squid fisheries and the California light fishery. Sus Kato pp. 23-27. 4. Squid trawling gear and techniques. Duncan Amos pp. 28-36. 5. Squid jigging gear and techniques. Duncan Amos pp. 37-42. 6. Overview of Japanese squid fisheries. Bill Court, Frank Cary, Sus Kato, Warren Rathjen pp. 43-61. 7. Insuring orderly development of the Oregon squid fishery. Richard Thompson, Bob Loeffel, Terry Thompson, Joe Easley pp. 62-86. 8.
