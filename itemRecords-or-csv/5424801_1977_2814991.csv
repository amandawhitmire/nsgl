13,Abstract:,"The impact of shoreline stabilization structures on adjacent unprotected properties is a key consideration in the evaluation of construction permits. To address this issue, the researchers initiated a project consisting of two elements: hydraulic model studies and a field monitoring program. Results indicate that the impacts increase as the structure length increases. The experimental results and the field data of other researchers have shown that the depth of excess erosion is approximately 10% of the seawall length. The laboratory data also revealed that the along-coast length of erosion from each end of the structure is approximately 70% of the structure length."
