11,Abstract:,"It must be remembered, when considering legal rules for ocean activities, that civilized man has traditionally placed the prime responsibility for the formal organiza​tion of his society in various sovereigns or governmental authorities. It therefore is very important to know or to decide which governmental authority, if any, has the power to regulate ocean activities in any given area. The manuscript for this publication was prepared at the University of Oregon School of Law, one of the participants in the Oregon Sea Grant Program."
