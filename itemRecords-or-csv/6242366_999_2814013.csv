17,Abstract:,"Information on high seas recoveries of salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) tagged with coded-wire tags (CWTs) has been reported annually to the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (1981-1992) and to the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC, 1993-present). Data from these CWT recoveries are also reported into the coastwide on-line CWT recovery database (http://www.rmp​c.org) maintained by the Regional Mark Processing Center (RMPC) of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC). This document lists recovery data for 34 CWT salmonids that will be reported to PSMFC/RMPC for the first time. These 34 CWTs were recovered from the 2008 U.S. groundfish trawl fishery in the Gulf of Alaska (13 Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), the 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2009 U.S. groundfish trawl fishery in the eastern Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands (7 Chinook salmon), the 2008 Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) trawl fishery in the Northern Pacific Ocean off Washington/Oreg​on/California (WA/OR/CA, 10 Chinook salmon), the 2008 limited-entry non- hake groundfish trawl off WA/OR/CA (2 Chinook salmon), and 2008 U.S. trawl research in the northern Gulf of Alaska (2 coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch)."
