12,Abstract:,"The El Nino of 1982-83 was an unusually intense phenomenon which produced severe erosion along much of the Pacific coast. Initially, the main contributing factors were exceptionally high local water levels and a series of storms which generated intense wave conditions. However, erosion has continued on the Oregon coast due to that El Nino, which disrupted the beaches from their general equilibria primarily by a northward sand transport unusual for the Oregon coast. That transport deflected the inlet to Alsea Bay, producing erosion on the adjacent spit for three years until the inlet finally returned to its normal position. Major erosion is still continuing on Netarts Spit. Apparently, sand was permanently removed from the nearshore; erosion of Netarts Spit will continue so long as the beach remains depleted in sand."
