14,Abstract:,"A conditional choice model was used to analyze truck-barge transportation demand. Truck-barge demand was found to be own rate elastic but inelastic to rail rate changes. Transit time, equipment availability and variance in waiting time were far less important compared to rates, in determining model choice."
