10,Abstract:,"Projects undertaken in recent years are generally ones with public benefits, such as ports, marinas and other water-oriented development. But these projects also result in adverse environmental impacts that chip away at the estuarine resource base which supports commercial and recreational uses. Natural resource managers at the local, state and federal levels have made an effort to stem this tide of adverse impacts. They have implemented procedures aimed at restoring, creating or enhancing estuarine habitat to mitigate unavoidable environmental damage. This paper discusses estuarine mitigation in the Pacific Northwest and the relationship of mitigation to other resource management strategies. Overall mitigation strategies and goals for individual projects are outlined, followed by a discussion of regional goals and estuary-wide mitigation planning. Information sources for wetland creation and restoration are presented, and design principles summarized. Finally, suggestions for improving mitigation technology and procedures are offered."
