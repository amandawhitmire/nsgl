11,Abstract:,"Microencapsulat​ion technology offers the most hopeful approach for producing artificial diets for suspension-​feeders in which diet composition can be varied in a defined manner. Cross-linked walled protein microcapsules have previously been developed and shown to be ingested, digested and assimilated by suspension- feeding bivalves. This study examined the effect of adding carbohydrate to protein capsules on the utilization of encapsulated protein by mussels (""Mytilus trossulus"") in a series of in vitro enzyme incubations and an in vivo feeding experiment. Findings demonstrate that utilization of microencapsulat​ed protein by mussels cannot be accurately predicted from results of in vitro enzyme assays. Importantly, up to 50% of the dry weight of cross-linked walled protein microcapsules can be replaced with carbohydrate without significantly affecting encapsulated protein digestion and assimilation efficiencies for ""M. trossulus""."
