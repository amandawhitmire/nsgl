10,Abstract:,"On August 22-23, 2012, a workshop was hosted by the Arizona Game and Fish Department and convened in Phoenix, Arizona, by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Association of Attorneys General, Oregon Sea Grant, the National Sea Grant Law Center, and the Western Regional Panel on Aquatic Nuisance Species. The purpose of the workshop was to engage Assistant Attorneys General, natural resource agency attorneys, law enforcement supervisors, policy makers, and the Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) Coordinators from the 19 Western states, interstate organizations, and Federal partners to establish clear legal and regulatory approaches and opportunities for AIS abatement and reform. One clear deliverable from this workshop was the creation of an action plan that articulates needed actions at the federal/nationa​l, regional, state, and local levels to minimize the expansion of invasive mussels through watercraft movements in the western United States. Online information includes agenda, participant list, presentations, white papers, and action plans as wells as a list of contacts and a list of additional resources."
