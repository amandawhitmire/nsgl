12,Abstract:,"This remarkable and timely book shows that the history of the Northwest salmon crisis is long and disturbingly consistent, with concern over declining salmon runs beginning in the 1880s. The book explores the cultural forces that have--in just 150 years--nearly brought to extinction salmon that have run in the Columbia River Basin for thousands of years. The heart of this book is its collection of documents from the last 140 years. Some of these documents are historical photographs and other graphic images. But even more important are the printed documents assembled here. The documents were chosen by the contributing writers to either reveal a cause of the salmon decline or reflect the concerns of those who saw it coming. The eighty documents collected here address such issues as habitat, hatcheries, hydropower, fisheries, Indian fishing rights, and watershed management."
