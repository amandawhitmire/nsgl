12,Abstract:,"Existing research on marine reserve efficacy focuses on developing sets of management indicators tied to outcomes listed in the marine reserve management plan or on the achievement of a single objective such an increase in the size or number of female fish in a reserve. These approaches, however, fail to capture the dynamic complexity of social, cultural, economic and ecological processes and tradeoffs associated with the establishment and operation of marine reserves. Moreover, there is usually little recognition of local coastal communities and the values they hold in the evaluation of the relative benefits and costs of marine reserves. New approaches grounded in the ecosystem based management (EBM) paradigm are needed to better evaluate the efficacy of marine reserves. We describe a preliminary framework for monitoring and evaluating the ecosystem services that are connected to the spatial management of Oregon's nearshore. This framework integrates biophysical data and state-​of-​the-​art community-based social and economic evaluation methods. It identifies ecosystem services, ecosystem benefits and their value to evaluate the costs and benefits of changes in the use of the marine environment. We also describe the proposed application of this framework to two pilot marine reserves in Oregon state waters. The outcome of this study promises to be a groundbreaking case study of marine reserve efficacy that is widely applicably at the state, regional, national and international level."
