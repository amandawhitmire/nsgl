15,Abstract:,"Physical oceanography and modeling have recently become priorities in national and state-level goals for science and math curriculum as well as ocean literacy. We are developing an inquiry based exhibit to educate the public about the variability of currents in an estuary and how scientific models can be used to study estuary dynamics. The exhibit theme used to introduce these topics is Olympia Oyster restoration in the local Yaquina Bay Estuary. The interactive game component mimics a method for native oyster restoration, depositing oyster shells removed during harvesting back into the estuary to create habitat for oyster larvae to settle upon. The estuary dynamics component of the game is based upon a numerical model developed specifically for this estuary and exhibit. The site for prototyping and evaluation of the exhibit is the Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) in Newport, Oregon. Research on the effectiveness of the exhibit at reaching its educational outcomes is in the initial stages. We will present front-end evaluation results including surveys and interviews conducted at HMSC to determine the public's background knowledge, and feedback from initial exhibit drafts."
