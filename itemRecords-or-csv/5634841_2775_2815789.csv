14,Abstract:,"The potential of using the torsion test and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine the effect of frozen storage on protein denaturation in fish fillets was investigated. Pacific whiting fillets were stored for 12 weeks at three temperature conditions: -20 deg. C, -8 deg. C, and at a level varying between 0 and -8 deg. C. The shear strain value of the torsion test proved to be a useful tool for the determination of protein denaturation in Pacific whiting during periods of frozen storage. Because Ca++-ATPase activity, shear stress and shear strain, and myosin transition enthalpy all decreased within one week, protein deterioration in frozen Pacific whiting appears to be rapid at the temperatures tested."
