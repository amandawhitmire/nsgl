14,Abstract:,"The Salmon River estuary, in Oregon, offers a unique opportunity to simultaneously evaluate several estuarine restoration projects and the response of the marsh community while making comparisons with a concurring undiked portion of the estuary. The authors of this paper summarize the conceptual approach and early results from studies of the ecological functions for salmon in the Salmon River estuary. Drawing on assessments of capacity, opportunity, and realized function, they examine such questions as: What differences in biotic response are seen in marshes of different ages compared with an undiked reference marsh? Does the diet of juvenile Chinook salmon differ significantly among marshes? What are the potential consequences of differences in trophic structure?"
