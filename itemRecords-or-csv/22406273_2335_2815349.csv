11,Abstract:,"This information is for Sea Grant staff and others who wish to evaluate the online presence of outdoor recreational tours and other guided-​experience businesses. It describes a low-cost method for documenting the products and prices offered by such businesses and for measuring their success. The method was developed to evaluate coastal tour operations in Oregon, but it can also be applied to other locations and types of tours. The results of such data collection, especially if conducted annually, will help fill a gap in long-term trend information about tour operator prices, industry growth or contraction, and types of services."
