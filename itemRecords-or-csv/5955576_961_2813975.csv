12,Abstract:,"As the amount of developed coastline increases, the pool of remaining buildable waterfront land tends to diminish in quality. Prospective buyers should educate themselves about building on oceanfront property before making a purchase. This newsletter describes common concerns that affect coastal property in Oregon such as bluff erosion, beach erosion, and weather events. Also provided is a checklist to help assess traits of any particular parcel."
