9,Abstract:,"Seacast is an easy-to-use, interactive, online map that lets commercial fishermen check forecasts of ocean conditions off the Pacific Northwest coastline. Seacast is available on the Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing Systems (NANOOS) website. This application is the culmination of multiple years of research based on conversations with fishermen that aimed to make ocean forecasts as accessible as weather forecasts."
