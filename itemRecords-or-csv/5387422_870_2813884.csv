11,Abstract:,"A study was initiated during the spring of 1984 to investigate the utilization of Netarts Bay by juvenile chum salmon. Specific objectives are to determine (1) the use of the estuary by hatchery and wild chum salmon, (2) the residence time of chum salmon in Netarts Bay, and (3) the size at which the fish emigrate from the bay. This report summarizes some of the results of the 1986 field season. Most of the observations made in previous years were repeated in 1986, providing data on interannual variations in patterns of estuarine utilization of juvenile chum salmon. Feeding ecology of juvenile chum salmon was also emphasized."
