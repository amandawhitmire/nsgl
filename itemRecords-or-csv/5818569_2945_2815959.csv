11,Abstract:,"The tubular recycle photobioreactor can promote the mass cultivation of photosynthetic cell suspension cultures. A batch reactor model was developed to predict the cell density vs. time profile for the cultivation of photosynthetic cell suspension cultures in the tubular recycle photobioreactor​. The model uniquely couples culture illumination parameters in the tubular section to interphase CO2 mass transfer parameters in the aeration tank. The model predicts a critical cell density at which photosynthetic biomass production switches from a rate- limited process to a CO2 delivery limited process. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the CO2 mass transfer coefficient in the aeration tank, the residence time of the culture in the tubular section, the ratio of tubular section to aeration tank liquid volume, and the partial pressure of CO2 in the aeration gas all affect the overall biomass production rate by affecting the CO2 delivery modes to the tubular photobioreactor​."
