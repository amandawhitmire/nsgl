11,Abstract:,"A theory that introduced species can be identified from their evolutionary, ecological, and geographical attributes (criteria for introduced species) is corroborated by the accuracy of its predictions. A human-borne, global invasion of the Oriental isopod ""Synidotea laevidorsalis"", that began over 100 years ago was discovered in a test of criteria for introduced species. Two explicit predictions from that work were (1) 'Many new records of endemic and introduced ""Synidotea"" populations around the world remain to be discovered,' and (2) '""Synidotea laevidorsalis"" is established, for example, in Brisbane, or Sydney, Australia.' Both predictions were correct. It appears that many estuarine and nearshore marine introductions have occurred that have not been discovered."
