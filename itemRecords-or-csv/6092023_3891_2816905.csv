14,Abstract:,"Surimi processors are seeking means to improve the utilization of seafood resources to increase productivity and also in response to the strong public pressure on this industry to reduce the organic matter in processing water discharged into the environment. Insoluble solids (IS) can be recovered from surimi wash water (SWW) by centrifugation. The quality implications of adding 0 (control), 1%, 3% and 5% of solids (SWW-IS) into surimi paste and gels were evaluated by determining their mechanical properties, moisture retention and color. This study showed that adding 1% SWW-IS improved the mechanical properties of Pacific whiting surimi with a minimal effect on color. Higher additions resulted in quality deterioration in mechanical properties and color."
