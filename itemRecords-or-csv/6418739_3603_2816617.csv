17,Abstract:,"The Laurentian Great Lakes are the crown jewels of the freshwater systems of North America. These five large lakes, their associated lakes, and their connecting channels hold about 23,000 km of water-enough to cover the contiguous United States to a depth of abut 3 meters (Great Lakes Environmental Atlas 1995). They comprise a series of ecosystems unique in the world and are the subject of considerable study, regulation, and observation. They also possess physical, chemical, and biological characteristics unique among all the largest lakes on the planet. Yet for all their immense size and grandeur, the Great Lakes have not been protected from anthropogenic perturbations, which have changed them on a basin-wide scale. The fishes of the Great Lakes, like all the aquatic flora and fauna, are completely dependent on their surroundings for their long-term survival. The primary objective of this chapter is to provide a broad-brush review of the key non-biological aspects of the Great Lakes that, in turn, provide the essential habitat for the fishes. Without the unique geology, physics, and chemistry of the lakes, as described in this chapter, the likewise unique fishes of the lakes could not survive or continue to evolve."
