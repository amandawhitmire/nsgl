11,Abstract:,"The physicochemical properties of gels prepared from Pacific whiting protein isolated at pH 3 and 11 with three concentrations of NaCl were characterized after a pH readjustment to 7.0. The strongest gels were obtained from fish protein isolate (FPI) prepared at pH 11/150-mM NaCl and conventional surimi. The protein solubilities of FPI treatments did not contribute significantly to their gel properties. Surface hydrophobicity and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that, in addition to adjusting the pH to 3 or 11, salt addition during protein solubilization and subsequent recovery at the isoelectric point (pI) led to protein denaturation. Rheological study indicated that gelation mechanisms of FPI were identical with the same NaCl concentration regardless of pH. The FPI prepared at pH 3 or 11 with NaCl could be partly refolded at pH 7. Nevertheless, some myosin fragments and actin did not refold."
