13,Abstract:,"Whether the U.S. fishing industry has benefited from extended fisheries jurisdiction is an empirical question and depends on how one defines benefits. Eugene Tsoa, William E. Schrank and Noel Roy recently estimated a price-inelastic demand for groundfish. Such a finding does not, in itself, mean that total revenues or net revenues accruing to the domestic fishery will fall in response to increased harvest opportunities. This paper compares their findings with those of others and derives an alternative set of policy implications, focusing on the question of price elasticity of demand for groundfish."
