12,Abstract:,"An epizootic caused by a newly described rickettsial pathogen is ongoing among salmonids cultured in southern Chile; infectivity studies have subsequently shown the rickettsia to be pathogenic for both coho salmon and Atlantic salmon ""Salmo salar"". Fluorescent antibody tests are widely used for detection and diagnosis of disease in both human and animal medicine. The methods have become standardized, and the results are specific; for this reson, an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) was developed for detection of the coho salmon rickesttsia. The method and results of the test are described."
