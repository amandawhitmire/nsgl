15,Abstract:,"Nutrient abatement programs to reduce the effects of cultural eutrophication are often implemented in an effort to reduce hypoxia and mitigate hypoxic effects on fishes. Yet, it is unclear how hypoxia actually affects habitat quality for fishes, particularly those in midwater. Reduced oxygen availability has the potential to cause mortality or indirect sublethal effects, including reduced feeding and growth rates, changes in behavior and distribution, and increased encounter frequency with predators or prey. Detailed analyses of spatial distributions of environmental factors and fishes in the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay and the Northern Gulf of Mexico suggest that spatial distributions and other habitat features, such as water temperature and the timing of hypoxia, have species and ecosystem specific effects. Indeed some fishes may actually benefit from hypoxia. Research needs to focus on these complex interactions, including the degree of overlap between predators and prey habitats, and changes in the habitat quality and growth rate potential of fishes. Comparisons across ecosystem may yield further insights into intra-specific and food-web variability in response to hypoxia and eutrophication."
