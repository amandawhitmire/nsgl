11,Abstract:,"Patterns of beach erosion and accretion due to jetty construction are examined for the coast of Oregon. All jetty systems are included with the exception of those on the Columbia River, making a total of nine systems. All evidence indicates that these areas of the Oregon coast are experiencing a seasonal reversal in the sand drift, but with a zero or near zero net drift over a several years time span. Thus shoreline changes resulting from jetty construction are not the usual examples of jetties blocking a net drift as found in southern California and elsewhere."
