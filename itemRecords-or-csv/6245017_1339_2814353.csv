9,Abstract:,"For social-​ecological systems to be resilient not only scientists and managers but citizens and communities must be constructively engaged. But how? Multidisciplina​ry teams formed by the Sea Grant programs at Oregon State University and University of Maine have been developing a bi-state project assisting coastal residents and communities identify decisions that will contribute to resilience to climate change effects. The Oregon component of the project will be emphasized. Communicating with non-specialists about the risks associated with climate change and about making decisions to respond is categorically a ""risk communication"" challenge. The Oregon project uses a well-​established model of risk communication as the conceptual framework. The theoretical foundation of this communication model is behavioral decision making; an output of the model is communication that helps the audience make well-informed decisions about their concerns. The research leader on this project will describe the project's stepwise ""mental models"" approach, involving 1) the assembly of the climate scientists' expert model; 2) the use of surveys, focus groups, and interviews to establish a baseline of empirical knowledge about the communities of interest; 3) the use of concept maps, influence diagrams and other modes of decision support to engage and assist communities in deciding about prudent actions that could contribute to resilience. This user-driven approach is different from much public communication about science, especially from some resource agencies, in its focus on what decisions the individual user or community wishes to make, rather than on what the scientists might like to tell them. Resilience to climate change needs capable ""boundary organizations"" that can facilitate communication, understanding, and collaboration among and between natural and social scientists, managers, and communities."
