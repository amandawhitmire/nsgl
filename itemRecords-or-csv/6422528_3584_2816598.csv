9,Abstract:,Free iTunes application Firewood Buddy: Trees are being destroyed through the transportation of invasive insects and diseases found in firewood. One of the most important things we can do to protect trees is to stop moving firewood. Don't move firewood-buy wood at or near where you will be camping. The Firewood Buddy app is a tool that can help you.
