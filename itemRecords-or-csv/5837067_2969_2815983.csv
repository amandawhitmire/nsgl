13,Abstract:,"Lyngbyabellin B was isolated from a marine cyanobacterium, ""Lyngbya majuscula,"" collected near the Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida. This new cyclic depsipeptide displayed potent toxicity toward brine shrimp and the fungus ""Candida albicans."" The planar structure was deduced using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic methods, and the stereochemistry is proposed through a combination of NMR and chiral GC/MS analysis."
