10,Abstract:,"Ceratomyxa shasta is a myxozoan parasite identified as a primary contributor to salmon mortality in the Klamath River. The parasite has a complex life cycle involving a freshwater polychaete host, Manayunkia speciosa. The ecological requirements of this polychaete influence the severity of infection in fish. An understanding of what contributes to high densities and infection of this host may provide management opportunities to reduce the parasite effects. A laboratory based flow experiment showed that a high flow facilitated the greatest polychaete densities, whereas experimentally induced polychaete infection prevalence was higher at the slower flow. Infected rainbow trout at the slower flow rate had a shorter mean day to death, indicating a higher infectious dose than at the faster flow. Thus, at least under slow flow conditions, increased water velocities may decrease C. shasta infection severity in the fish and infection prevalence in the polychaete host."
