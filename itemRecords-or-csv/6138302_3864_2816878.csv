13,Abstract:,"We investigated the effects of stress over the final stages of sexual maturation on the reproductive performance of female rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Stress was administered over the period of early vitellogenesis (1.5 mo), late vitellogenesis-​final maturation (1.5 mo), or during both periods (3 mo). Each stress treatment and control was triplicated, with eight females in each replicate (n = 24 fish per treatment). The eggs and progeny of each female were kept separate, and observations were made for 4 mo after transfer to rearing tanks. Fish that experienced stress during final maturation and those that were under stress during the whole experiment ovulated on average 2 wk earlier than the control group. In contrast, fish stressed during the period of early vitellogenesis ovulated at the same time as controls. Absolute fecundity and fertilization were not significantly affected in any treatment group, but significant differences in relative fecundity were found. Stress applied early in vitellogenesis resulted in smaller eggs and swim-up fry. No significant differences were found in juvenile weight 8 wk after hatching. Furthermore, we found no differences in survival of the progeny or resistance to the fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. Thus, mild acute stresses applied to rainbow trout females may affect certain reproductive performance parameters such as timing of ovulation and relative fecundity; however, the progeny of such stressed females perform as well as controls with regard to juvenile growth and disease resistance."
