12,Abstract:,"In 1963, fishery biologists began constructing a bypass canal and low dam on a shallow estuarine slough in Oregon's Alsea Bay. This Oregon Game Commission project was an experiment in bioengineering, an attempt to transform Lint Slough into a productive rearing pond for juvenile salmon. With the aim of enhancing salmon growth, a system of canals and dams was designed to carefully regulate the mix of fresh water and salt water in the slough and to trap upwelled ocean nutrients. Biologists hoped that Lint Slough would produce ""super fish"" that could grow to a smolt size ready to migrate to the ocean within a few months, a feat that some salmon require more than a year of natural rearing to achieve. Moreover, as one salmon booster put it, if the natural rearing habitats of salmon can't be protected, then why not create a fish that doesn't need them? Why do salmon have to climb over dams and swim to the top of the Rockies to spawn? Why not raise salmon where they are protected from hazards such as pollution, dams, predators like birds, otter, bear, and man; where disease can be controlled; where drought, logging, destruction of spawning beds can't occur; and where growth can be controlled and even increased tremendously?"
