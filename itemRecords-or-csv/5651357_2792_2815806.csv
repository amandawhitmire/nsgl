10,Abstract:,"Diverse marine life, including algae, sponges, molluscs, corals, tunicates, and bacteria, have been found to possess a variety of structurally unique oxylipins. The algae are the best characterized of these organisms for their oxylipins, which have now been described from more than 30 species representing the three major groups of macrophytic algae. A number of recent studies have sought to understand the biosynthetic origin and mechanistic chemistry which leads to the formation of these unique marine substances. This review updates the records of new oxylipins from marine algae and describes thoughts on their biogenesis as well as specific experiments aimed to probing these hypotheses."
