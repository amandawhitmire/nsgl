10,Abstract:,"Increasing population, rising energy consumption, climate change, and peak oil are accelerating the search for practical alternative energy sources to fossil fuels. Some renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar, are well known, use reliable technology, and have established markets. Other renewable technologies that are still in development show promise for meeting a portion of future electricity needs. As one legal scholar recently observed, experience from abroad ""can provide insight into how a coordinated regulatory, financial, and energy plan can be designed."" This article compares the present status and context of one type of hydrokinetic energy, wave energy, in the U.S. and Scotland, two countries whose regulatory programs and experiences will surely influence each other in coming years. The article also provides a synopsis of wave energy in the U.S., including a brief history and the current status of the industry and its regulatory framework; describes wave energy's status in Scotland; compares the two nations' procedures for licensing wave energy devices; and identifies factors that appear to contribute to the development of a wave energy industry in ways that are reasonably timely, as well as environmentally and economically prudent. The article concludes with some thoughts on wave energy's path forward."
