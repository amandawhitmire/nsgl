10,Abstract:,"Protection of biodiversity is a key issue for fishery management, but there are large uncertainties about its implementation. Making the institutional transition from a single-species orientation to one of biodiversity is complicated by the history of fisheries management, the current state of fisheries, and the procedures of fishery decision-​making. Significant challenges to institutional design for biodiversity lie in the agencies, decision bodies, and regulations. Without serious and fresh attention to innovative design, the institutional environment of fisheries is likely to be completely inadequate to the task of protecting biodiversity."
