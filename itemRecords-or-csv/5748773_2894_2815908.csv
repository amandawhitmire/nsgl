12,Abstract:,"Pacific whiting surimi paste was ohmically heated to investigate degradation of myosin heavy chain (MHC) caused by endogenous proteinase over a range of temperatures and times. Changes of degradation rate increased with temperature; rate of MHC degradation decreased with higher temperature. Generally, failure shear stress strain increased linearly with MHC content. Proteolytic degradation of actin exhibited the same trend as that of MHC but at a slower rate."
