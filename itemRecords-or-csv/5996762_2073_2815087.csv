11,Abstract:,"albacore tuna, lipid, omega-3 fatty acids"
12,,"Intrinsic quality characteristics​, including lipid, moisture, and fatty acid content, of West Coast albacore tuna (""Thunnus alalunga"") was investigated. West Coast albacore tuna were troll caught off the Oregon coast, delivered to the Oregon State University Seafood Laboratory, held at -30 degrees C and analyzed for lipid distribution in different areas of the muscle. Additional albacore were troll caught off the Oregon coast and analyzed fresh for fatty acid content. Core samples were taken from six designated body zones of the fish. The lipid content ranged from 3.9 plus or minus 0.2 to 36.3 plus or minus 1.1%, with a distribution of higher lipid towards the head and lower lipid towards the tail. Total omega-3 content averaged approximately 40% of the identified fatty acids for each body zone, with average omega-3 (g/100 g tissue) ranging from 2.1 plus or minus 0.5 to 3.5 plus or minus 0.4. An inverse correlation (R^2 = �0.95) was found for lipid and moisture content."
