10,Abstract:,"The causes and effects of hypoxia have been confounding marine scientists since the 1970s, when so-called ""dead zones"" first started appearing in oceans and large lakes. Currently there are more than 400 dead zones worldwide. How did this happen, and how can it be fixed? As Nathan Gilles, Oregon Sea Grant's 2011 Science Communication Fellow, spent time with Sea Grant-funded researchers Francis Chan, Lorenzo Ciannelli, and Stephen Brandt, he uncovered a rich and complex story."
