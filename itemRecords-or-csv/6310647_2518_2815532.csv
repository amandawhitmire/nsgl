12,Abstract:,"The Great Lakes are an important resource for recreational activities that involve full body contact with water, such as swimming, water-skiing, sail-boarding and wading. Apart from the risks of accidental injuries, the major human- health concern for recreational waters is microbial contamination by bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Many sources or conditions can contribute to microbiological contamination including combined sewer overflows after heavy rains. On-shore winds can stir up sediment or transport bacteria in from contaminated areas. Animal/pet waste may be deposited on beaches or washed into storm sewers. Agricultural runoff, such as manure, is another source. Storm water runoff in rural and wilderness area watersheds can increase densities of fecal streptococci and fecal coli forms as well. In this study, physical hydro-​meteorological data such as precipitation, runoff, wind direction, and air temperature; as well as biological data, E. coli counts, were analyzed to determine their statistical relationship. With the aid of a four-​dimensional, data visualization tool also developed during this study; a multiple-​linear-​regression, beach-closure forecast model was developed as a function of antecedent rainfall, runoff, wind direction, and watershed air temperatures. This model uses commonly available data and is programmed in an exportable language so that it can be easily transferrable to any beach. Both the data visualization tool and the beach closure forecast model results will be presented."
