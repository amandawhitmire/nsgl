13,Abstract:,"The objectives of this work were to understand the function of active components in the gel-enhancing effect of bovine plasma protein on Pacific whiting surimi gels. Bovine plasma fractions enriched in macroglobulin, transglutaminasâ€‹e, bovine serum albumin, and fibrinogen were evaluated for protease inhibition, potential protein cross-linking activity, and gel strengthening of Pacific whiting surimi to gain insight into the mechanism of gel enhancement by bovine plasma."
