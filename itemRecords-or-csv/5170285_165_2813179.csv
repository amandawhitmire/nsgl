11,Abstract:,"Severe erosion occurred on Siletz Spit on the central Oregon coast in the winter of 1972-73 (Fig. 1). One partially constructed house was lost and others were saved only by the immediate placement of riprap, large rocks installed at the base of the property to prevent wave erosion. This episode of erosion received widespread publicity in the news media. For a time it was feared that the spit might breach, much like Bayocean Spit had in 1952 on the northern Oregon coast, The erosion to Bayocean Spit resulted from the construction of a jetty at the entrance to Tillamook Bay. No jetties are present at the Siletz Bay inlet. Instead, the erosion is associated with rip currents, strong narrow currents that flow across the surf zone to out beyond the breakers. Rip currents erode embayments on the beach, at time cutting back into the dunes on which the houses were built. Because conditions similar to Siletz Spit occur elsewhere on the Oregon coast, such episodes of erosion could be repeated. Documenting the erosion to Siletz Spit and explaining its causes may help prevent this."
