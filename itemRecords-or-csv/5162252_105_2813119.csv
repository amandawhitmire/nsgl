11,Abstract:,"Here at Oregon State University (OSU), Sea Grant has worked hard with Oregonians for the past 11 years to promote the wise conservation and use of marine resources. We have addressed problems that people face with our solid research talents at OSU and the University of Oregon. We have helped educate marine resource users, whether they be fishermen or lawyers. We have transmitted the results of our research to Oregonians and Oregonians have voiced their concerns about the ocean and coast to us through the Marine Advisory Program. This annual report highlights accomplishments during the 1977-1978 fiscal year. It is an interim report, brief but concise. I think it will give you a good idea of why we have chosen the projects we have and our investigator's accomplishmentsâ€‹."
