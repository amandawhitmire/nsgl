12,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of GOX/CAT (glucose oxidase/catalasâ€‹e) solutions with different GOX/CAT ratios on the growth inhibition of four microorganisms usually found in shrimp. The GOX/CAT mode of action on the inhibition of these microrganisms (""Pseudomonas fluorescens"", ""Acinetobacter calcoaceticum"", ""Corynebacter aquaticum"", and ""Hansenula polymorpha"") was also investigated."
