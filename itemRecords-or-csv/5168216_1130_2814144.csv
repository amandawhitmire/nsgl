11,Abstract:,"This study of food consumption and growth of larvae of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, Thunberg, is intended to provide some of the basic information necessary for the efficient operation of commercial oyster hatcheries. As a part of the study, the caloric content of larvae of various sizes was determined to provide a meaningful measure of mass. The effects of algal concentration (Monochrysis Lutheri) and larval density on the growth of larval oysters was measured in a flow-through feeding system. Algal concentration and larval food consumption can be optimized in a flow-through system to provide for maximum larval growth and efficient use of algal food. Removal of algae at the rate of 2,600 algal cells per larva per hour does not result in appreciably better growth than the removal of 1,300 algal cells per larva per hour. A modified flow-through feeding system, applied to a commercial oyster hatchery, could improve utilization of cultured algae, and yield increased larval growth."
