7,Abstract:,"Cummins Creek on the central Oregon coast is perhaps easy to miss. Where it enters into the ocean about three miles south of Yachats, it's just a modest stream. But those who know it consider it a hidden gem, as Congress recognized in 1984 by protecting the forest that surrounds the creek in order to ""preserve in a wilderness state the last remaining virgin stands of Sitka spruce, western hemlock, and Douglas fir in Oregon's coastal lands."" This short video highlights not only the beauty of the place but the role of the Sitka spruce forests in both Oregon history and environmental understanding. 2009. 9 minutes, color, DVD."
