12,Abstract:,"Limited entry regulations attempt to promote fishery resource conservation and economic efficiency in the fishing industry. While not prohibited, limited entry regulations are subject to the privileges and immunities clause, commerce clause, equal protection and due process provisions of the federal constitution. The comprehensive limited entry program established by the state of Alaska provides an opportunity to evaluate these constitutional proscriptions in a practical setting."
