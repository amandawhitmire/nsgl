14,Abstract:,"This revised edition of the report from a 1992 Sea Grant- sponsored workshop on domoic acid includes an updated bibliography (complete through January 1994) and a new preface, tracing the course of domoic acid research since 1992. Amnesic shellfish poisoning is a recently identified threat to the seafood-​consuming public. It is caused by the neurotoxin domoic acid, which can be concentrated by filter-feeding shellfish as they consume smaller organisms that produce the toxin. Participants at the workshop included some scientists who have studied problems related to domoic acid since the first outbreaks in Canada and many west coast scientists who have been part of the immediate response efforts there. Among them were experts in toxic phytoplankton, domoic acid-producing phytoplankton, phytoplankton ecology, shellfish biology, molecular biology, and physical oceanography, as well as representatives from government agencies and industry."
