12,Abstract:,"It has become increasingly obvious that to restore and protect the beleaguered Pacific salmon, regulators, governments, landowners, and local communities must change the way they manage at the watershed level. In response to this need, Oregon created a watershed-based program, the Oregon Plan for Salmon and Watersheds. Similarly, Oregon State University has taken a multidisciplina​ry approach to the strategic and technical needs of the watersheds it serves. The Watershed Extension Program is supported by Oregon Sea Grant, Extension Agriculture, and Forestry Extension. It contributes to salmon and watershed restoration through well-placed, competent staff and through programmatic efforts such as the Watershed Stewardship Education Program. The WSEP is a model for similar programs in other states. However, the strength of OSU's Watershed Education Program lies in the expertise of county-based staff and the relationships they have developed with local communities, landowners, and watershed councils. Funding cuts to Extension staff are one of the program's major obstacles."
