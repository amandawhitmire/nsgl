12,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) has caused extensive epizootics among hatchery-reared salmonid fish and occasional epizootics in wild salmonids from the U.S. west coast. Isolates have been grouped by molecular weight differences in the structural proteins of the virion, resulting in the placement of IHNV isolates into 5 electropherotyp​es. The purpose of this study was to determine the virulence of type 3 IHNV electropherotyp​es obtained from different geographic regions in chinook salmon and steelhead trout and compare these results to the virulence of type 1 and 2 strains in the same species of fish."
