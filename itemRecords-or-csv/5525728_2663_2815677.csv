11,Abstract:,"Microencapsulat​ion technology offers a potentially useful approach for delivering nutrients to marine and freshwater suspension-​feeders. The main objective of this study was to reduce the susceptibility of capsules to bacterial degradation in seawater, and therefore increase the efficiency with which encapsulated protein can be delivered to marine suspension-​feeders. Here, the preparation and use of protein-walled capsules and glyceride-​coated nylon-​protein-​walled capsules are compared for the delivery of dietary protein to oysters."
