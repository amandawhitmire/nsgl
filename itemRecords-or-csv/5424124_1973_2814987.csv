12,Abstract:,"The pink shrimp, ""Pandalus jordani"", fishery off Oregon was one of the most economically viable fisheries during the late 1970s with landings in excess of 26,000 tons in 1978. Subsequent to that time, pink shrimp landings have declined, with slightly over 2,000 tons being landed in 1984. The purpose of this study was to describe the dietary habits of the Pacific hake and, in particular, to determine whether predation by Pacific hake on pink shrimp could explain some of the fluctuations seen in pink shrimp landings."
