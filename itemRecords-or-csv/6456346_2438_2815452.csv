12,Abstract:,"A methodology is presented to identify possible rip current embayments from lidar-derived shorelines along the U.S. Oregon coast. Analyses of these features include their location and their representative length scales in an effort to determine a desired orientation of the features. A total of 99 embayments were analyzed having an average length and amplitude of 575 meters and 17 meters. During the major El Niï¿½o event of 1997/1998 there is an increase in size; however, the total number of embayments remained unchanged. The locations of rip embayments in the respective surveys does not show any significant correlation and appears to be random."
