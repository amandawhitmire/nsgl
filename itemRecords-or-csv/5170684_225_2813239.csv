12,Abstract:,"This study of citizen participation in Oregon's coastal zone planning covers events between 1971 and March 1975. Coastal zone planning was initiated in 1971 by legislation establishing the Oregon Coastal Conservation and Development Commission (OCC&DC). The work of the commission is discussed in the study. In accordance with the provisions of the 1971 legislation the OCC&DC concluded its work early in 197S and went out of existence. In the meantime, the Oregon Legislature created the Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) with statewide planning responsibilitie​s, including the authority to establish binding state standards. The study presented in this report is designed to analyze and evaluate the citizen involvement program undertaken by OCCSD."
