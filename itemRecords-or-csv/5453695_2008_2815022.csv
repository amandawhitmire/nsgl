11,Abstract:,"Fishermen who wish to freeze and store at sea must be aware of a few potential problems. (1) The system is expensive; some systems require multiple circuits and controls. (2) Sale of the fish must be prearranged. (3) Freezing may require more work and attention, and catch rates must not exceed freezing capacity. In a well-designed system, air at temperatures of -20 deg F or lower flows at high velocity over the product. Leaving fish in the freezer too long can cause dehydration. The frozen storage area ought to be separated from the freezer and have a nonfluctuating low temperature."
