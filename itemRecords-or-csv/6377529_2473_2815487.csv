11,Abstract:,"In January of 2011, the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) instituted a trawl rationalization program for the West Coast groundfish trawl fishery. The program is intended to create a more sustainable fishery and increase economic efficiency through the use of individual fishing quotas (IFQs) and cooperatives (co-op). However, since the new program specifically targets trawling, it leaves the existing management structure of other groundfish fisheries in place. Because of this, new challenges are created to ensure that regulations are set equitably across fisheries. This research reviews the structure and catch of the West Coast groundfish fleet one year after the trawl rationalization program went into effect. In particular, it focuses on changes that have a larger potential impact on local communities."
