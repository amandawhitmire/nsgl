12,Abstract:,"Without illustration or first-hand experience, probability distributions may remain abstract theoretical constructs in an introductory statistics class. To give students experience in using the Poisson distribution, the instructor may use plot-sampling methods for plants or animals to determine whether a distribution is random, clumped, or uniform. However, such methods typically take a lot of time and might require a laboratory section or specialized equipment. As an alternative, the authors describe a simple interactive demonstration that was successfully used for two years in an undergraduate biostatistics lecture. The demonstration immediately and clearly illustrated the Poisson distribution, and a student survey indicated strong agreement that the activity had educational value and should be kept in future years."
