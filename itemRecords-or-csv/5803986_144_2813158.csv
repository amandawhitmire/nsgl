11,Abstract:,"Written especially for landowners and managers, watershed council members and educators, a new series by Oregon Sea Grant helps readers understand how, where, and when salmon live in watersheds and what people can do to help conserve and restore their runs. This publication, one of four in the series, focuses on the current situation and the life cycle of the coho salmon, one of Oregon's most commercially important, but much threatened, varieties."
