15,Abstract:,"This report describes results of the third year of an evaluation of the online presence and prices of companies on the Oregon coast that offer tours for kayaking, salmon fishing and whale watching. It also compares those 2019 results with findings from 2017 and 2018. Our aim was to see which businesses appeared in location-​specific Google searches and better understand prices for these three types of recreational activities."
