12,Abstract:,"The objectives of this research were to investigate the heat coagulation of fish protein from frozen fish mince wash water by ohmic heating, the kinetics of coagulation process, the effectiveness of heat coagulation in waste reduction, changes of electrical conductivity as temperature rises, and the energy efficiency of ohmic heating process. The highest heating temperature for effective coagulation of proteins and removal of solids is 70C. The relationship between heating temperature and heating time followed a second order polynomial model."
