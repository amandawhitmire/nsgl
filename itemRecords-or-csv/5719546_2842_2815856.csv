13,Abstract:,"The objectives of this study were (1) to determine if developing steelhead trout are able to metabolize steroids such as pregnenolone, testosterone, or estradiol; (2) to determine if these animals have the ability to form and excrete glucuronide conjugates, and (3) to determine if differences in metabolite production exist between two distinct stages of early development."
