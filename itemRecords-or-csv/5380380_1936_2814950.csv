10,Abstract:,"This article analyzes three 1984 judicial decisions that reverse hydroelectric authorizations made by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). They restrict FERC's discretion by (1) limiting the exemption of small-scale hydroelectric projects from federal licensing (""Tulalip Tribes v. FERC""); (2) sanctioning mandatory license conditions imposed by federal fishery agencies (""Escondido Mutual Water Co. v. LaJolla Band of Mission Indians""); and (3) requiring the same fishery consideration and environmental procedures in relicensing as in initial licensing (""Yakima Indian Nation v. FERC""). These decisions weaken FERC's `superagency' control over hydroelectric regulation, opening the way for more pluralism in the approval process. A number of recommendations for congressional amendment of the Federal Power Act are offered."
