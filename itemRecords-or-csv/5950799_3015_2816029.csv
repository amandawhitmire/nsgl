12,Abstract:,"Organisms imported as live seafood can be released into environments of new locations, where they can establish reproductive populations. The risks of such introductions remain poorly resolved. Scientists therefore surveyed bivalves (oysters, mussels, and clams) that are commercially available as seafood in the western United States. Twenty-four of the 37 available marine and estuarine bivalve species are nonindigenous. Eleven of these 24 nonindigenous species have established self- sustaining populations in northeast Pacific environments. Three more species have been introduced outside their natural ranges elsewhere in the world. The authors estimated the risks of some of these species by performing binomial probability analyses on these data."
