11,Abstract:,"Logistic regression analyses showed that the maturity ""v."" length relationship for female English sole varied significantly among sampling locations from California to British Columbia in June-September. Stepwise analyses found that latitude, bottom gradient, bottom temperature and sediment type were all significant factors. Regression analyses of age at length from subsamples indicated that latitude, maturity and bottom sediment had significant effects on growth. Data from the aged subsamples showed significant differences among age classes in the length v. maturity relationship with older fish attaining maturity at smaller sizes than younger fish. Growth rate and length at 50% maturity have decreased substantially relative to observations from the 1950s, but age at 50% maturity has increased."
