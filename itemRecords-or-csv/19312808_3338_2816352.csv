11,Abstract:,"Researchers at Portland State University are studying the amounts and types of microplastics in razor clams and oysters along the Oregon coast. These extremely small plastics can come from foams, tiny beads in facial creams, fibers from clothing, and disintegrating plastic bags. The researchers aim to see if there are specific places on the coast where microplastics are more prevalent and if their presence is more common during certain times of the year. The research is conducted by marine ecologist Elise Granek and master's student Britta Baechler."
