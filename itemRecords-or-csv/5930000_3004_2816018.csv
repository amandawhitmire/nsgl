12,Abstract:,"This article reports on a database categorizing the processes of discovery used in 323 North American archaeological sites that have an antiquity of at least 7500 years. It discusses tabulations of discovery processes, types of material found in these sites, and methods used in dating them. These findings provide a context for research strategies currently used in seeking evidence of human occupation during the Pleistocene-â€‹Holocene transition."
