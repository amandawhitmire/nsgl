12,Abstract:,"Bacterial kidney disease is a slowly developing chronic infection caused by ""Renibacterium salmoninarum"". The disease is one of the most widespread and devasting salmonid diseases and occurs not only in hatchery populations but also in native wild salmon and trout. Development of a protective vaccine requires a greater understanding of the piscine immune response against ""R. salmoninarum"". In this study, an anti-salmonid immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody was used in western blot analyses and indirect fluorescent antibody techniques to detect antibody to ""R. salmoninarum"" and to identify the bacterial antigens that are immunogenic in the fish."
