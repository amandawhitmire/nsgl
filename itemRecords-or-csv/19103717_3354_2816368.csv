10,Abstract:,"Use the comprehensive species module here for an in-depth understanding of the American bullfrog. Modules include a comprehensive species guide, a species-​at-​a-​glance fact sheet, a related lesson plan, suggested activies, comprehension questions, and videos and related on-line resources. The American Bullfrogs are a highly reproductive aquatic species that are native in central, eastern United States and Southeastern Canada. This species was first introduced to western America as a food source (frog legs!); since then it escaped aquaculture ponds and have spread widely. Bullfrogs lay up to 20,000 eggs each season, and are voratious predators: they eat anything that fits in their mouth. Bullfrogs can be recognized by the large round eardrums behind its eyes."
