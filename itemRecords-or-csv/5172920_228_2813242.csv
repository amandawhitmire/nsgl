12,Abstract:,"Geothermal sites in the United States' Pacific Northwest may represent useful locations for commercial freshwater aquaculture. Ge​othermal aquaculture projects are underway at several levels, through private enterprise and through universities. Considerable interest beyond these existing attempts prompted the convening of the workshop whose proceedings are published herein, Participants included fish farmers, biologists, engineers, economists, planners, lawyers, food scientists, and educators, representing government agencies, industries, and the universities. Workshop participants sought consensus on the initial potential of geothermal aquaculture for commercial success. Questions addressed included: what species can or should be produced; what biological constraints exist through nutrition, disease, or husbandry; and what engineering, economic, marketing, or institutional and legal problems must be solved. Research, training, and advisory needs were identified and priorities described."
