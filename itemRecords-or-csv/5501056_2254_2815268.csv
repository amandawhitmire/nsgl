12,Abstract:,"The Oregon subduction zone is actively venting pore fluids from the accretionary prism which produce vent sites consisting of one or more of the following features: (1) benthic animal communities harboring chemosynthetic bacteria, (2) carbonate deposits, and (3) anomalously high methane concentrations. Carbonate deposits, apparently formed by precipitation from oxidized methane and CO2-charged fluids, occur on the upper continental slope and outer shelf. Extensive areas of carbonate crusts, slabs, chimneys, and irregular edifices were mapped on the seafloor in water depths ranging from 92 to 382 m. These carbonate structures are covered with abundant living benthic organisms, especially crinoids. The chimneys apparently grow both within the bottom sediment and above the sediment-water interface depending upon the rate of clastic sedimentation surrounding the structures."
