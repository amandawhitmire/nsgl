15,Abstract:,"The WW2100 broader impacts team developed a slide set for students about the water cycle in the Williamette Basin. The slide set helps students think about where the water we use comes from, and the factors that affect its availability and quality. The slide set is designed for students grade eight and above and includes: *Specific examples of ways natural and human processes affect water supply and demand in the Williamette Basin. *A list of the specific Next Generation Science Standards addresses. *Suggestions for pre- and post-quiz questions to determine the content's effect on student understanding and opinions related to water. This slide presentation is based on work from the Williamette Water 2100 project, a scientific research project that evaluated how climate change, population growth, and economic growth will change the availability and the use of water in the Williamette River Basin (WRB) over the 21st century. The project ran from October 2010 through September 2016, and was a collaborative effort led by faculty from Oregon State University (OSU), the University of Oregon (UO), Portland State University (PSU) and the University of California-​Santa Barbara."
