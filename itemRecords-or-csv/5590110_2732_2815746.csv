10,Abstract:,"Recent positive developments in the Pacific Northwest have major implications for ocean management for the next 20 years. Examples are the Administration'â€‹s decision to postpone offshore oil and gas leasing off Oregon and Washington until 2000 and the continuing domestication of fish harvesting and processing in the Exclusive Economic Zone. In Washington, the groundwork has been laid for improving the ocean side of the state's Coastal Management Program. This is a necessary move if, for example, the region is to become involved with oil and gas development in Alaska. Washington State cannot go it alone, however. The entire region needs to assess the cumulative effects of multiple ocean uses in the region and guide federal and state research activities toward regional planning and management needs. The priority problem is the declining quality of coastal water."
