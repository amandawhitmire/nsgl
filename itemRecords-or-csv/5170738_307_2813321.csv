10,Abstract:,"The history of Oregon's commercial fisheries has been dominated by two little-​noted events with far-​reaching impacts. The first, the innovation of canning salmon, changed salmon from subsistence fare for settlers and Indians to a commodity sold worldwide. The first cannery on the Columbia River opened at Eagle Cliff, Washington Territory, in 1866. Salmon was king until 1935, when the Oregon legislature changed regulations to allow the reduction of pilchard, a herring, into oil, This second event led to the development of the modern trawl fisheries."
