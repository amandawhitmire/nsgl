13,Abstract:,"In this study the authors examine ancient marine placers in uplifted Pleistocene terraces of southern Oregon to establish long-term processes of nearshore placer development and preservation. Terrace placer deposits south of Cape Arago, Oregon, are compared on the bases of geometry, stratigraphic development, heavy mineral sources, and paleo-shoreline reconstruction. These placers are known to vary greatly in size, shape, and heavy mineral concentration, and might provide on-land analogs to potential placer bodies buried offshore in continental shelves."
