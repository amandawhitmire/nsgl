15,Abstract:,"The biogenetic source of most marine algal oxylipins, which are many and of diverse structure, can logically be unified through a common lipoxygenase-â€‹derived hydroperoxide to epoxy allylic carbocation transformation. The biological role of oxylipins in algae remains an enigma, although numerous ideas have been put forth. Here, the authors hypothesize and provide some evidence for an osmoregulatory role for these metabolites."
