12,Abstract:,"This circular reports the results of a 1978 preliminary survey of the present and expected development by the maritime ports on the upper Snake-Columbia River system. The objectives were: 1. to describe the capacity, growth, and financing of these ports; 2. to determine the location advantages andproblems from the port district management's viewpoint; 3. to determine location needs and disadvantages from the viewpoint of firms now located in the port areas; and 4. to make inferences from these views and the economic development to date."
