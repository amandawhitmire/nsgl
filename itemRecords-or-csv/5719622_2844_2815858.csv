11,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to elucidate possible endocrine control mechanisms of sexual differentiation in salmonids by evaluating development of the BPGA (brain- pituitary-​gonadal axis) and sex steroid profiles in control (normal mixed sex) and monosex populations of rainbow trout through the period of sexual differentiation​, and by correlating hormonal events with gonadal development. No differences were seen between males and females in the timing of appearance, localization, or staining intensity of these peptide hormones. Given that the brain-​pituitary-​ gonadal axis seems to be intact during the process of sexual differentiation (and the fluctuations of steroid levels during this process) sex steroids may play the driving role for sexual differentiation of rainbow trout."
