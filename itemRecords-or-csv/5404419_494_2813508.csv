14,Abstract:,"A diverse group of organisms occupies the upper 20 cm of the ocean's water column. Those organisms that reside immediately below the air-sea interface are called `neuston'; those at the interface are called `pleuston.' The researchers examined pleustonic and generally neustonic organisms found in the intestines of several pelagic predators, particularly juvenile salmonids, collected off the coast of Washington and Oregon. They examined the abundance and distribution patterns of all taxa greater than 5 mm (including terrestrial insects) and compared the species composition and relative abundance of the taxa collected in the neuston nets with those found in the stomachs of juvenile coho and chinook salmon."
