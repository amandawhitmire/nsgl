12,Abstract:,"The identity of two species of ""Laemonema"" fish from the upper slope off Chile is resolved. ""Laemonema multiradiatum"" Thompson is a junior synonym of ""L. globiceps"" Gilchrist. The second species, previously confused with ""L. multiradiatum"", is described here as new. The new species appears to be widely distributed in the southern ocean and is very similar to a rare North Atlantic species, ""L. latifrons"", and, less so, to an eastern tropical Pacific species, ""L. gracillipes"". Another apparently related taxon, represented by a single damaged specimen from New Zealand, is currently indistinguishabâ€‹le from ""L. latifrons""."
