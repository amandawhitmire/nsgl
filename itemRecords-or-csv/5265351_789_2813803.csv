12,Abstract:,"This report discusses the impediments that have already acted to inhibit sea-farming in the coastal zones of the United States. Section I provides an overview of the worldwide aquaculture industry, including a summary of the advantages of aquatic husbandry over both land-​based agriculture and traditional fishing techniques. The impediments to aquacultural development in the U.S. follow in Section II, broken into three categories of constraints: socioeconomic, biological, and legal. In Section Ill, West Coast salmon ranching is used to illustrate how these factors have combined to inhibit a particular aquaculture enterprise. The study then concludes with a discussion of the type of planning that will be required to ameliorate the problems both faced and created by aquaculture along our nation's coastlines. KW: AQUACULTURE; HUSBANDRY; SALMON; RANCHING; LAW."
