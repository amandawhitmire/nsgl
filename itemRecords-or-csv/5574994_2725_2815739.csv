12,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) virus (IHNV), a rhabdovirus, is the etiological agent of IHN, an economically significant disease that affects the young of several salmonid species. The mortalities of fry and fingerlings can be as high as 90%, and occasional less severe epizootics in smolts and 2-year- old fish have been reported. The purpose of this study was to develop a staphylococcal coagglutination test for the rapid detection and identification of IHNV in cell cultures and in tissue samples from infected fish. The test, which takes less than 15 min to complete, is a specific and reliable test for identifying IHNV infections in cell culture and tissues from naturally or experimentally infected fish. This test is also sensitive, does not require any specialized equipment, and would be suitable for field use."
