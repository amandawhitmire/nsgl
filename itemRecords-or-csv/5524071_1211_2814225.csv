8,Abstract:,"Some of the most interesting and important marine science of the 1980s has been conducted at seafloor hot springs. The exploration of these dynamic environments is revolutionizing our understanding of the geology, chemistry, and biology of the oceans. This 10-minute video documents the research activities of the NOAA Vents Program in an underwater volcano of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. The underwater footage was filmed in 1986 by scientists on board a research submarine; featured are close-up views of active hot spring `smokers' and unusual life forms."
