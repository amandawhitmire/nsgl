11,Abstract:,"In recent years, the Pacific grenadier has become a large commercial fishery in California and Oregon. To properly manage this rapidly developing fishery, the age structure and growth characteristics of the fish must be known. Age estimates in this study using growth increment data indicate the Pacific grenadier is a long-lived fish. To validate this information, age was determined using the radioactive disequilibria of 210Pb and 226Ra in otolith cores from adult Pacific grenadier. Results are compared with other age and growth studies of the Pacific grenadier, and management recommendations are made."
