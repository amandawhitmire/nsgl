13,Abstract:,"Clam digging is an inexpensive and popular sport that can provide a year-round source of excellent food. Oregon's coastal bays contain at least five major clam species-- gaper, cockle, littleneck, butter and softshell. The succulent razor clam can also be found on surf-pounded beaches along certain stretches of the coast. This photo- illustrated, fold-out poster describes the different species and how to find them, gives tips for clam-digging equipment and explains how to transport, clean, prepare and store the clams."
