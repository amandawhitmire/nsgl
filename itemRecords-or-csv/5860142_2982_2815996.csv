11,Abstract:,"The objectives of this research were (1) to evaluate the efficiency of chitosan-​polyanion complexes to recover suspended solids in surimi wastewater and cheddar cheese whey as affected by the polyanion used, monomeric weight ratios, concentration in whey, and treatment time; and, (2) to investigate coagulation mechanisms using ultraviolet/vis​ible spectroscopy and analysis of coagulated solids."
