10,Abstract:,"In 1978, International Sea Grant agreed to fund a Latin American program whose roots were already well established at Oregon State University. The timing of Sea Grant's involvement could not have been more propitious. The International Southern Ocean Studies program ISOS! was drawing to a close. One of the many long-term projects that made up the International Decade of Ocean Exploration Program, ISOS had been a vehicle through which U,S. scientists established contacts and exchanged data with Latin American scientists. No other significant support was available. Prospects were dimming for continuing the university's cooperative efforts with Latin American institutions. With Sea Grant support, OSU's Latin American program acquired the only substantial funding it had ever had. This panel sized brochure goes into more detail including Oregon State University's (OSU's) Latin American Oceanography Program, The International Sea Grant Program for Latin America, and highlights of the program."
