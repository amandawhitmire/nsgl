13,Abstract:,"Several conduction-​heated food products, mostly seafood, are processed in oval-shaped containers. These commercial activities would benefit from a simulation model to estimate thermal processes for this type of container and to predict the resulting food quality. This paper describes a mathematical model for the sterilization of conduction-​heated foods in oval-shaped containers to estimate the mass-average bacterial lethality and the retention of a quality factor with known kinetics of destruction (e.g. texture, vitamins, color). The model uses a finite difference approximation method and was implemented on a personal computer."
