13,Abstract:,"There has been increased interest in utilizing seafood processing waste due to limited biological resources and increased environmental concerns. Attention has been given to proteinases due to their essential role in food processing, biotechnology and other industries. Pacific whiting surimi wash water proteinase was recovered by ohmic heating, ultrification, and freeze-drying. By these processes, 5.9-fold purification was achieved. The most efficient step was ohmic heating, which concentrated the proteinase by 4.8-fold."
