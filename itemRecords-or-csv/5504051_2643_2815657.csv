However, in the haste to gain media visibility, they sometimes overlook a valuable marketing resource-​-​extension's relationship w ith influential people. Keys to successful communication with decision makers are (1) to coordinate communications with elected officials, (2) to know your elected officials, (3) to get organized by preparing success stories on significant extensi on programs, (4) to develop a communication plan, and (5) to conduct effective legislative visits."
