12,Abstract:,"A fixture of Oregon coastal farming is coming under new scrutiny because of its environmental effects. Tide gates?essential​ly hinged metal doors at the ends of culverts?have been used for centuries to prevent flooding in and help drain low-lying coastal lands, making it possible for people to farm and build on land that would otherwise be under water. Unfortunately, in many cases the devices have also compromised or destroyed critical fish and wildlife habitat. The effects of tide gates on estuaries and wildlife were the focus of a three-day symposium that presented introductory information on tide gates and their effects on estuarine habitats and fish passage and provided a forum for coastal managers, biologists, engineers, and others to exchange information. These proceedings reflect many of the papers presented at that symposium."
