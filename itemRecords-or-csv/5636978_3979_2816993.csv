10,Abstract:,"Recent concerns about some North Carolina fisheries have raised questions concerning larval fish entry into estuaries. Two major barrier island inlets, Oregon and Ocracoke Inlets, that connect Pamlico Sound with the Atlantic Ocean were quanititatively sampled for larvae at new moon monthly intervals during 1988-89. Monthly collections were made to determine the following for each species at the two inlets: (1) when each species was present, (2) relative densities, (3) larval lengths, (4) surface/bottom comparison and (5) day/night availability."
