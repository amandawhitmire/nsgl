11,Abstract:,"Widely accepted evidence has now linked certain kinds of refrigerants to a depletion of stratospheric ozone. Some of the major culprits are several refrigerants, most of which are used in the food industry. R-12 (a designation for 'Refrigerant-​12') and R-502 are at the top of the list; R-22 is on the list but a bit further down. Because laws are now going into effect that will limit their use soon, you should begin planning now to replace or upgrade your refrigeration system. This fact sheet defines a few of the terms, outlines some of the recent laws you will need to know, and mentions some alternative refrigerants to replace those now in use."
