11,Abstract:,"Federalism is the system of government of the United States and therefore both the Congress and state legislatures must take care to act within the Constitutional ​ limitations defining this system of government. The Constitution expressly gives various powers to the federal government; all remaining powers not enumerated therein are reserved to the governments of each of the states. These remaining powers are generally known as the ""police powers"" of the state and are exercisable subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution. The focus of this paper is the above-quoted supremacy and commerce clauses of the Constitution. The purpose of this paper is to provide a general summery of these important limitations on the states' power to regulate the onshore impacts of outer continental shelf oil and gas recovery."
