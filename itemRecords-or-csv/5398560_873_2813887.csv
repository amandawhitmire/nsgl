14,Abstract:,"Support structures for offshore platforms consist of vertical, horizontal, and inclined cylindrical members. Since the design for these platforms is increasingly refined for large, expensive structures, knowledge of forces on individual cylindrical members becomes increasingly important. This work concerns horizontal cylindrical members in periodic waves and in periodic waves with towing (waves plus current). Laboratory experiments were run on cylinders with different surfaces: smooth, sand-roughened, barnacle-​roughened, and one with rigid, artificial sea anemones. Both amplitudes and phases of harmonic components of horizontal and vertical forces were analyzed by Fourier analysis. Flow visualization techniques were used to observe flow around stationary horizontal cylinders. Wave-to-wave variations of forces were clearly observed. It was found that the vortex motions contribute strongly to the variations of force coefficients. Such variations are smaller in the horizontal direction and for the rougher cylinders."
