11,Abstract:,"I am going to be talking about some of the costs of litigation, and what I am going to be discussing today is not the result of a formal research project or a calculation of costs associated with litigation. What I will present are reflections and perspectives from the point of view of someone who participates in the fishery management system as a scientific adviser. So, it is in part a view from inside the regional management council system and, in part, the perspective of an outsider participating in that system as an adviser to the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) and to NMFS. The perspective that I have is also the perspective of an economist, who has seen the cost effects of litigation roll through the fishery management system. I interpret litigation as an economist, and I look at the bundle of costs litigation imposes on the fishery management system."
