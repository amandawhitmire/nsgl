11,Abstract:,"Three key resource bills are up for reauthorizationâ€‹: the Magnuson Fishery Protection Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act. The hodgepodge of incidental take provisions in these bills is very complex. Congress should consider the statutes in concert rather than separately, but it is unlikely that Congress will implement such a holistic approach. Reasons include the mobility of the marine species concerned, the mixed track record of the federal agencies charged with their protection and management, and congressional inability to legislate with the big picture in mind."
