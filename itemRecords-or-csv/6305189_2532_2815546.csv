8,Abstract:,"The ""Science for Sustainable Fisheries"" exhibit (displayed at the Hatfield Marine Science Center Visitor Center in Newport, Oregon) contains locally-made scale models of local fishing vessels, each representing a specific fishery from fish (tuna and salmon) to pink shrimp and Dungeness crab. A description of each fishery accompanies each model, along with actual fishing gear. A video demonstrates working excluder devices. A trawl net with an excluder device (and model halibut) hangs overhead."
