12,Abstract:,"A Papua New Guinea collection of the marine cyanobacterium ""Lyngbya majuscula"" yielded two new and toxic natural products, hermitamides A and B. The hermitamides were isolated using a brine shrimp toxicity assay. Planar chemical structures were established through 1D and 2D NMR, as well as FABMS data. Semisyntheses of hermitamides A and B were achieved by coupling the acid chloride derivative of 7(S)-​methoxytetradec-​4(E)-​enoic acid, obtained from the same cyanobacterium collection, and the respective free amines, phenethylamine and tryptamine. Bioassays of the organic extract show activity in brine shrimp and mouse neuroblastoma cell toxicity assays."
