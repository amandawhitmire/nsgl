12,Abstract:,"Previous studies have demonstrated that physiological concentrations of cortisol associated with acute stress in-vivo can suppress the in-vitro antibody and mitogenic responses of coho salmon lymphocytes. Researchers have found that cortisol-​mediated suppression was due to a reduction of the antibody-​producing cell (APC) precursor frequency, without a significant effect on the clonal proliferation of the precursor. Thus it appears that a mechanism for cortisol-​induced immunosuppressi​on is the reduction of the availability of required differentiation factors found in conditioned media. This study aimed to determine the source of the APC precursors responsbile for the restoration of the cortisol-​suppressed response by conditioned medium, using the limiting dilution assay."
