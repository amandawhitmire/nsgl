11,Abstract:,"Increased development of the Oregon coast for domestic housing, recreation, and industry makes it economically important to understand processes of coastal erosion and deposition. Of all the erosional processes, landslides are undoubtedly the most important. Landslides occur along 70 of the 150 miles of northern Oregon coast from the Columbia River to Florence."
