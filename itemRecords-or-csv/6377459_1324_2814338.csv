12,Abstract:,"Throughout the United States coastal communities are implementing programs and projects in response to the current and impending impacts of climate change. Many communities have discovered and continue to seek innovative ways to integrate novel 21st century technology into the coastal climate change adaptation process. One small rural community on the Oregon coast is using online project management and collaboration software to manage their decision making process. This community is experiencing increased erosion, flooding and severe weather events resulting from changes in the climate. In response to this, a group of concerned citizens, county officials, and University staff have coalesced to address these issues. The software facilitates the project and maintains an ongoing database of many materials relevant to the initiative. Each member of the project committee is given a username and password that allows secure access to the project site. The software allows for the upload of various file types, including text and image documents. It is also capable of maintaining documents that can be collaboratively edited by various members. The poster displays how online project management and collaboration software helps to manage the climate change adaptation initiative in this rural Oregon coastal community. It identifies ways in which the collaborative process is supported and discusses the various benefits and shortcomings of this technology being used in this context."
