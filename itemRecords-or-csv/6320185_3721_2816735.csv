11,Abstract:,"Tsunami sources created by subduction-type earthquakes are usually confined to strips of a large but finite aspect ratio. We analyze such tsunamis that propagate across a region of finite depth. Based on classical shallow-​water-​wave theory, an accurate and convenient form of the asymptotic solution is obtained for comprehensive descriptions of the nondispersive aspects of the waves. The directivity of the energy radiation and the domain of pulse persistence are quantitatively described. Our analysis gives an estimate of the initial water-surface displacement at the tsunami source of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, which turns out to be in excellent agreement with the result computed from the seismic wave inversion."
