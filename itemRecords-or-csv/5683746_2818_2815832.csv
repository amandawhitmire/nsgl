13,Abstract:,"Pacific Whiting undergoes excessive softening due to a proeolytic enzyme in the flesh. Beef plasma protein (BPP), egg white and potato extract were retested for their ability to inhibit proteolysis in fish mince and surimi made from Pacific whiting. Strong inhibition resulted from all three compounds in fish mince when measured by autolysis. However, when tested in surimi, significant differences occurred among the compounds. BPP showed strongest inhibition of proteolytic effect followed by egg white and potato extract when measured by autolysis, gel electrophoresis and torsion. BPP was an effective inhibitor in surimi at a concentration as low as 1%."
