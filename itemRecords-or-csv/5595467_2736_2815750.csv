12,Abstract:,"There is uncertainty about the length of the pelagic life of Dover sole ""Microstomus pacificus"". There is also little agreement on estimated body length at the end of the first year of life. Uncertainty about duration and growth in the pelagic phase has important implications for age estimates. From large multiyear midwater trawl collection and juvenile bottom-trawl surveys conducted off Orgeon, researchers describe metamorphosis and other stages in the early life history of Dover sole and address questions relating to the duration and timing of these stages."
