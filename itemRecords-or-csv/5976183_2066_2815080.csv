13,Abstract:,"The tropical red alga ""Ochtodes secundiramea"" is an excellent model system for the study of halogenated monoterpene production. The primary objective of this study was to profile the spectrum of halogenated monoterpenes produced in an ""O. secundiramea"" laboratory culture system and explore the factors that influence the halogenated monoterpene product composition, focusing on nitrate availability. Toward this end, the investigators had to first establish a sustainable plantlet suspension culture system and determine the optimal culture conditions for its growth."
