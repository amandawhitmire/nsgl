10,Abstract:,"Extreme climatic events can have a profound effect on ecosystem stability. For example, the drought-induced sudden marsh dieback of 2000 left over 40,000 ha of Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh in Louisiana nearly devoid of vegetation. Although much of the affected salt marsh recovered naturally, nearly 7,000 ha were converted to perpetual mudflat due to sediment surface subsidence caused by compaction, dewatering, erosion, and prevailing decompositional processes following plant morality. In an effort to restore an area of degraded marsh turned mudflat, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (LDNR) pumped a slurry of hydraulically dredged sediment on to a dieback affected salt marsh to raise the surface elevation and provide more suitable conditions for vegetation recolonization. The irregular distribution of sediments created surface elevations that ranged from 13 to 36 cm above the surrounding unaffected reference marsh. Over a three period, we measured surface elevation change, sediment accretion, soil organic matter accumulation, and soil bulk density in areas that received either low (+13-18 cm), medium (+20-25 cm), or high (+28-36 cm) sediment intensities to determine the elevation range at which marsh function was restored. Our results show that all sediment-​amended areas had less soil organic matter than the unaffected reference areas. Areas that received medium or high sediment intensities also had higher soil bulk density, lower rates of sediment accretion, and less elevation gain when compared to unaffected reference marsh. However, elevation change, sediment accretion, and soil bulk density were similar between the low intensity sediment-​amended areas and the unaffected reference marsh. Based on these results, we conclude that the low-intensity sediment-slurry amendment created conditions that facilitated recovery of salt marsh accretionary processes in the short-term."
