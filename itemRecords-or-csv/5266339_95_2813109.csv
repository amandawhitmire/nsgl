16,Abstract:,"Pleuronectids (saltwater flatfishes) make up a significant fraction of Oregon's trawl fisheries. Oregon's Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) keeps count of more than 13 species of flatfishes landed commercially from state and adjacent waters. While the number of trawlers has been rising, the typical new boat may be up to twice the length of its predecessor, with proportionally ​ greater fishing capacity. For heavily exploited flatfish stocks, this trend points up urgent need for refining fisheries management capabilities. I​nvestigators in the Pacific Northwest have been stockpiling catch and effort statistics and biological data for 25 years. Their research has linked fluctuations in key fisheries with variations in physical and biological factors in the fishes ' environment. Russian trawlers first appeared in Oregon waters in 1966. Their intrusion onto previously uncontested domestic fishery grounds escalated fishing effort in the northeast Pacific and aggravated Americans. The Fishery Conservation and Management Act imposes a political solution to social and biological problems. This document is a response to requests from local fishing industry, which the project's principal investigators interpreted as indicative of need for a holistic study of the dynamics of the commercially important flatfish stocks off Oregon. The primary target species of the Oregon pleuronectid fishery are Dover, English, petrale, and rex sole."
