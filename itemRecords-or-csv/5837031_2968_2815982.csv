12,Abstract:,"The myxosporean parasite ""Ceratomyxa shasta"" is enzootic in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada and is a factor in the survival of resident and anadromous salmonids throughout the region. Unlike other diagnostic methods, DNA-based techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allow detection in fish of all parasite life stages. However, so far these tests require that the fish be sacrificed to obtain the diagnostic sample. In this work researchers describe a non-lethal method to sample fish for PCR assay. The detection efficiency of this technique is compared with lethal sampling using both a single-round and nested PCR and with the standard microscopic examination protocol."
