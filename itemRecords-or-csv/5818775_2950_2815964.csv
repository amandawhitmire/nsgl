12,Abstract:,"Chemical investigation of the marine red alga ""Ceratodictyon spongiosum"" containing the symbiotic sponge ""Sigmadocia symbiotica"" collected from Biaro Island, Indonesia, yielded two isomers of a new and bioactive thiazole-​containing cyclic heptapetide, ""cis,cis"" and ""trans,trans"" isomer exhibits potent inhibition of sPLA2 expression in a cell-based model for antiinflammatio​n, and was also shown to inhibit the expression of a human-sPLA2 promoter-based reporter by 90%."
