12,Abstract:,"Indian Point appears to represent a winter village of the Kathlamet, a Chinookan people who lived upstream from the Clatsop at the mouth of the Columbia River estuary. Small-scale excavations in 1978, in dense cultural deposits averaging 1.4 m deep, encountered evidence of occupation spanning the late prehistoric and early historic periods. The artifact and faunal assemblages recovered from Indian Point provide a record of the resources exploited by Native peoples in the upper portion of the Columbia River estuary. The faunal assemblage as a whole is strongly estuarine and riverine in orientation, reflecting adaptation to an environment transitional between that inhabited by the Clatsop along the coast and other Chinookan peoples farther upstream in the Columbia River Valley."
