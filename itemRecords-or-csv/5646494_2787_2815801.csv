12,Abstract:,"Ecklonialactone​s A, B, and E, previously isolated from the brown alga ""Ecklonia stolonifera"", have been isolated from the Oregon phaeophyte ""Egregia menziesii"" (feather boa kelp). This paper reports an independent structure elucidation of ecklonialactone E, which was only very recently identified from ""E. stolonifera"", and a determination of the absolute stereochemistry of all three metabolites by cd and optical rotation methodology."
