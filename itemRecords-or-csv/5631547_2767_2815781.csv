11,Abstract:,"Most research on bivalve nutrition has focused on quantitative requirements for energy and nitrogen rather than on qualitative requirements for specific amino acids. Few attempts have been made to identify the specific nutritional requirements of suspension-​feeders, primarily because it is technically difficult to define and manipulate the biochemical composition of their diet. In this study, protein microcapsules were used to manipulate dietary protein content, thus allowing unequivocal determination of the effect of dietary protein content on growth of a suspension-​feeding bivalve, the mussel ""Mytilus trossulus"". The advantage of using microencapsulat​ed diets is that their biochemical composition can be accurately measured and controlled, unlike that of algal diets, which is dependent on culture age and conditions."
