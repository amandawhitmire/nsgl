12,Abstract:,"Water, water, everywhere...bu​t why is water important? Why does the sea remain mysterious-​-​because its study is a science? What if science education crossed disciplines, explored connections, and presented science as a method rather than a discipline? This second edition of a marine education guide developed for use by K-12, was field-tested in Oregon classrooms; lists books, films, organizations and other resources; and illustrates their uses."
