12,Abstract:,"Comparisons of 16S rDNA sequences have become routine methodology for study of microbial phylogeny and have been used previously to classify members of the Rickettsiaceae. 23S rRNA genes are larger and more variable than 16S rRNA genes and therefore may be useful for phylogenetic comparisons of closely related organisms. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rRNA operons also show a large amount of sequence and length variation that is particularly useful for differentiating within species of prokaryotic organisms. To determine if genetic differences occur among isolates from different geographical locations, the 16S rRNA genes and approximately two-thirds of the 23S rRNA genes were sequenced from 5 isolates of ""Piscirickettsi​a salmonis"" and the complete ITSs were sequenced from 6 isolates. Results confirm that ""P. salmonis"" is a member of the gamma subgroup of the Proteobacteria and show that the isolates form a tight monophyletic cluster with 16S rDNA similarities ranging from 99.7 to 98.5%."
