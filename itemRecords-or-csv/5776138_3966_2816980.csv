9,Abstract:,"This booklet, published by the Oregon State University Fishing Families Project, is a compilation of material developed and presented at a 1989 workshop called 'Home Survival for Fishermen's Wives.' The attendees, all fishermen's wives, discussed the positive and negative aspects of a fishing marriage and talked about ways to improve on the negative aspects. The single most important result of the workshop was the realization that feelings harbored by each person were not unique; this realization helped bolster the wives' understanding of their situation. Also included is an outline of a presentation on effective listening."
