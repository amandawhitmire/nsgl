12,Abstract:,"Although viewed as a promising food processing technology, ohmic heating has a few constraints. One of these, seen at AC electrical frequencies below 500 Hz and at current density up to 3000 A/m2, is an electrolytic reaction at the electrode surface. Previous investigators had reported that this corrosion could be reduced by increasing frequency. Others observed that when Pacific whiting stabilized mince was heated at current density of 2300 A/m2 and at AC electrical frequencies of 5000 Hz and higher, the corrosion on the stainless steel electrode surface essentially disappeared. As this technology is further developed, some measure of electrode corrosion is needed. This study looked at the use of colorimetry to quantify stainless steel corrosion. An application is shown under conditions typical of those for surimi seafoods."
