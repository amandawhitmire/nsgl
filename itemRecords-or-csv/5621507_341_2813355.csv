15,Abstract:,"A one-year study was conducted to determine the quantity and distribution of fecal coliform (FC) bacteria in the commercial shellfish growing region of Yaquina Bay, Oregon. At low tide each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, samples were collected for determination of fecal coliforms in water, fecal coliforms in oyster meat, total suspended solids, and salinity. Data were obtained for air and water temperature, tidal elevations, Yaquina River flow, and rainfall at Newport and Toledo, Oregon. These data were analyzed to determine if correlations existed between fecal coliform levels and any of the environmental factors. In addition, samples were collected to determine: the source (point or nonpoint) of the FC in the bay, the presence of FC in sediments, the presence of human enteric viruses, the species of bacteria present in the bay, and the effect of tidal action on FC concentration."
