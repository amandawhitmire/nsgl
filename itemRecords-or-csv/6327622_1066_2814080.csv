13,Abstract:,"Oregon's land use laws provide a planning structure that uses city boundaries and urban growth boundaries to restrain development in designated areas and keep development out of zoned forest and agriculture lands. These land use laws encourage dense development within the city limits, provides a boundary for future growth and development (Urban Growth Boundaries), and provides a planning structure to protect water quality and significant resources (e.g. wetlands, open spaces, etc.) in these same areas. However, local jurisdictions have enough freedom to make land use decisions that significantly degrade these natural resources in the urban environment. The challenge is to help cities and counties recognize that forests, salmon habitat, water quality and other significant natural resources in urbanizing areas are best protected from development impacts by having a long term plan balancing dense ""smart"" growth with open space management. The Oregon Department of Forestry and Oregon State University Extension Service have joined together to deliver a variety of education programs aimed at elected officials, planning departments, developers, landscape professionals, contractors, and small woodland owners. These efforts include an Oregon-​Washington regional forests in transition conference, the creation of a BMP guidebook for protecting trees on development sites, an on-line urban forestry class, a Green Industry seminar, several presentations at OSU mini-colleges, and a spatial analysis coupled with presentations on how forest cover has changed in four different communities. The spatial analysis focused on several fast growing communities in Western Oregon, analyzed forest and impervious cover changes over the past 15 years, and predicted how this will continue to change with current land use laws. This presentation will highlight these programs, share lessons learned, and provide examples on how these programs could be adopted in other states. These efforts were part of the national FREMO (Forest Resource Education for Municipal Officials) program funded by the USDA."
