12,Abstract:,"Seacast is a Python Django web application that produces Ocean Forecasts on the Oregon Coast using models produced are Oregon State University, and elsewhere. Seacast is made and maintained in conjunction by the Senior Design teams from OSU’s Department of Computer Science and OSU’s Department of Marine Resources Management of the College of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. This year’s team from the Senior Design class added new features including showing tides on the site, producing a wind model, and fixed a major bug where Seacast would crash itself if a single model was missing. This document contains information on the yearlong process done by the 2016 Seacast team including documentation, requirements, and reflections. Seacast(Secast.​org) is a website that shows visualization of ocean forecasting off of the Oregon Coast and is designed for ease of use and simplicity. The project was first conceptualized by a Grad Student at the College of Earth, Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences, Duncan, after he discovered that Newport Fisherman had been using another ocean forecast site (nvs.nanoos.org​), but desired something simpler. With the help of Ted Strub and Flaxen Conway from the Marine Resource Management department of the COEAS the project was pitched to the Computer Science Senior Design Class. This team, who authored this document, is the third team to have worked on the project and consists of Miles Curry, Anthony Dunaway, and Will Olsen. There are a lot of other proprietary and forecasting applications available for commercial fisherman, but Seacast looks to serve models that are not normally available to fisherman for free. Seacast uses models that are produced here at Oregon State University including a local ROM’s model and OSU WW3. The clients for this project included Conway, and Strub. There were also others who helped with the development during this term including Craig Risien and Jessica Kuonen. Conway’s and Strub’s role in this project was primarily a supervisory role. They helped with figuring out and designing requirements and discovering fisherman needs and the overall site direction. As a supporter Risien helped with development by providing examples and information on producing plots and Kuonen help facilitate handling fisherman response. Seacast uses Django, a Python web framework, in combination with MatPlotLib, Numpy, Scipy and other python modules to produce high-quality forecast visualizations. MatPlotLib, in combination with numpy provide and easy interface to creating simple plots. MatPlotLib also allows for easy translation between MatLab since MatPlotLib was based off of MatLab. That is helpful because Risien creates his plots using MatLab and not MatPlotLib and they are a great reference."
