8,Abstract:,"Farmers of the sea was originally produced in an hour-long version for broadcast on the PBS science series NOVA. The best scenes from the original show are now available in a 29-minute version. The film traces aquaculture's begining, examines its more recent successes in Japan, and looks at its competitive edge over wild fisheries in Europe. The documentary questions the future of aquaculture in the United States and shows its potential for helping the people of developing nations feed themselves."
