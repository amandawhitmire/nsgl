11,Abstract:,"This bulletin deals only with the steady-state or static analysis of cable mooring systems and represents a. portion of a much broader investigation which includes dynamic effects. The complete analytical study, (Dominguez 1971) extends this static analysis technique to dynamic analysis using matrix methods. This makes it possible to obtain an eigenvalue solution. In reduced matrix form, the damped equations of motion are uncoupled by means of a linear transformation from the physical to a complex coordinate system, permitting evaluation of either characteristic or forced motion of cable systems."
