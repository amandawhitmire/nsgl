9,Abstract:,"State-space models are becoming more prevalent in ecology for their ability to separate the stochasticity due to population dynamics (process variance) and that due to the observational processes that generated the data (non-process variance). Although state-space models have been used to analyze time series for some time, only recently have the e↵ects of integrating multiple observations within a time step been explored. Collecting replicated samples within a time step may allow for more accurate and precise estimates of the non-process variance, therefore leading to more accurate estimates of the parameters governing the underlying ecological process, which is generally what ecologists are concerned with. In this dissertation, I adapt a log-linear state-space model that incorporates multiple observations at each time step to three di↵erent contexts. In the first chapter I examine the tradeo↵s between the length of a time series and the number of total observations and the e↵ect of that data structure on the precision of estimating the probability of quasi-​extinction in a population viability analysis (PVA). The results of this simulation study demonstrate that for species with relatively high process variance, a monitoring program that takes multiple observations during each time step will generate more precise estimates of the probability of quasi-​extinction compared to a program that takes only a single observation each time step. These results can be used to efficiently design e↵ective monitoring schemes for species of conservation concern. In the second chapter, I analyze the e↵ect of habitat alteration, specifically the conversion of sagebrush to agricultural land, on the population dynamics of twelve bird species in the Great Basin of the intermountain west, using multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models. All twelve species show strong support for equivalent growth rates between sagebrush and agricultural habitat, but a number also have support for unequal growth rates. Three of the four species most associated with sagebrush habitat show a noteworthy risk of decline, which contrasts with the population trend estimated as part of the standard breeding bird analysis. In the third chapter, I develop a state-space model for standardizing catch-​per-​unit-​e↵ort (CPUE) data into an index of abundance, while accounting for various covariates such as depth, gear type and fishing area. I compare the state-space model with a more standard delta lognormal model by applying them both to the wintery fishery for petrale sole o↵ the Washington and Oregon coast. Both models estimate similar indices, but the state-space model is slightly more precise in its estimate. This di↵erence in precision is more apparent in data-limited situations."
