13,Abstract:,"Concentrations of endogenous steroids and their glucuronide conjugates fluctuated during early development in steelhead trout ""Oncorhynchus mykiss"". Whole body content of sex steroids and steroid glucuronides of both bisexual and gynogenetic (all female) steelhead trout were quantified by radioimmunoassaâ€‹y. Based on fluctuating concentrations of all steroid glucuronides, both populations of fish demonstrated an ability to form glucuronide conjugates of all steroids at the embryonic stage. The changes in levels of both free steroids and their glucuronides during early development of the trout indicate that steroid metabolism is active during development. This study also implicates steroid metabolism as an integral part of embryonic and postembryonic development."
