14,Abstract:,"Populations that consume a diet rich in marine lipids have been reported to have a lower risk of coronary heart disease. However, some Western population groups with a high fish consumption continue to suffer elevated rates of coronary heart disease. Many of these individuals consume a diet rich in saturated fats in addition to the fish. This study investigated whether a high saturated-fat intake would counteract the beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids on in-vivo platelet and vascular eicosanoid formation and other hemostatic parameters that have been associated with arterial thrombosis. Results indicated that the effects of eicosapentaenoiâ€‹c and docosahexaenoic acids on platelet and vascular function and eicosanoid production are modulated by the content of saturated fatty acids in the diet."
