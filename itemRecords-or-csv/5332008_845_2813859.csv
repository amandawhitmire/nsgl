11,Abstract:,"The School of Oceanography, Oregon State University, initiated a study during the spring of 1984 to investigate the utilization of Netarts Bay by juvenile chum salmon. Specific objectives the first year were to determine: 1) the relative numbers of hatchery and wild chum salmon, 2) the nursery areas utilized by hatchery and wild chum salmon, 3) the residence time of chum salmon, and 4) the size at which the fish emigrated from the bay. This report presents the methods and some preliminary results from the 1984 field season."
