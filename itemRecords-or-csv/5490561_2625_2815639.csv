10,Abstract:,"The modern doctrine of public trust is best understood by focusing on the remedies courts prescribe for trust violations. Although there are four distinct categories of remedies in the case law, they all possess the unifying theme of promoting public access to trust resources or to decision makers with authority to allocate those resources. Thus, the trust doctrine is a democratizing force-​-​preventing the monopoly of trust resources and promoting decision making that is accountable to the public. State courts will continue to expand the public trust, relying especially on constitutional provisions that declare water to be publicly owned. The doctrine is a coherent body of law that supplies a necessary complement to prior appropriation principles, is not inconsistent with fifth amendment `takings' jurisprudence, and has sufficient grounding in various state constitutions and statutes to continue to infuse public concerns into western water law in the years ahead. not available from ORESU; a copy of the journal issue this article appeared in may be ordered for $10.00 from: ""Environmental Law"", Northwestern School of Law, 10015 SW Terwilliger Blvd., Portland, OR 97219.
