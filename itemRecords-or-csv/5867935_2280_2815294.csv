10,Abstract:,"Empty shells of ""Arctica islandica,"" an ocean quahog from the north Atlantic, have been found near Tillamook, Oregon. Live specimens, on the other hand, have not been recovered. The empty shells are insufficient evidence that reproductive populations of the ocean quahog are established in the Pacific. They do, however, indicate that bait traffic might provide a pathway for ""Arctica"" dispersal from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The authors discuss the risk of introducing ""A. islandica"" to the eastern Pacific as discarded live bait."
