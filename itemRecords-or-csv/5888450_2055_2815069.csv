13,Abstract:,"Buyback programs funded entirely or in part by the federal government have reduced the number of licensed fishing vessels in New England, Texas, and Washington. However, latent capacity--the ability of remaining licensed vessels to expand their rate of harvest, or of unused vessels to become active again--is large in each fishery that has experienced buyback programs. Also of concern is whether vessels, gear and fishermen who leave one fishery shift to other heavily exploited fisheries and contribute to problems there. In this chapter of the Federal Fisheries Investment Task Force's Report to Congress, the authors explain that buyback programs must be carefully designed by members of specific regional fisheries who clearly understand these issues."
