13,Abstract:,"Pacific whiting (""Merluccius productus"") is the most abundant fishery resource off the Northwest coast of the contiguous U.S. Due to the soft texture associated with proteolysis, diverse utilization of the species has been impeded. At present, the majority of harvested Pacific whiting is used for the production of surimi. Food-grade protease inhibitors have been found to limit the amount of proteolytic degradation of the muscle proteins; this improves the gel strength of surimi and increases its market potential. The objective of this study was to purify the protease responsible for tissue softening and weakening of surimi gel strength of Pacific whiting."
