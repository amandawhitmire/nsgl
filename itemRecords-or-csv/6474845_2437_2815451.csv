11,Abstract:,"Where does beach sand come from? Where does sand go? Why do beaches erode? Why does sand build up behind a jetty? What is a seawall? Visitors and coastal residents frequently ask questions like these. They want to understand better the natural forces that have helped to make the Oregon coast so attractive. This bulletin is a nontechnical introduction to these forces?what they do, how engineers sometimes can modify their effects, and why these modifications can have unpredictable consequences."
