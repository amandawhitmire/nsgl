12,Abstract:,"Community, as a territorial unit, persists as a major determinant of cultural behavior, despite all the integrating technologies of the electronic age. Two approaches toward the study of fishing, community study and an occupational focus, suggest alternative methods for analyzing and managing fisheries. Community studies lead to suggestions about including the community of fishing interest in management planning. Occupational analyses indicate how fishing differs from other activities, and how there is variability even among fishing activities. This research shows that within one fishery, community factors differentiate behaviors of fishermen. The reason community factors persist is in the pattern of information transfer. The more face-to-face interaction characteristic of community facilitates the transfer of ideas."
