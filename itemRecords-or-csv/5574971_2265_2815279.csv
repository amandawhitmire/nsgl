11,Abstract:,"""Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis"" is a benthic red marine alga present in abundance in sandy-rock habitats along the Oregon coast. This seaweed was found to contain several 12-lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid such as (12S)- hydroxyeicosate​traenoic acid (12S-HETE), (12R,13S)-​dihydroxy-​ (5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-​eicosatetraenoi​c acid (12R,13S-​diHETE), and (12R,13S)-​dihydroxy-​(5Z,8Z,10E,14Z,​17Z)-​eicosapentaenoi​c acid (12R,13S-​diHEPE). While this is not the only Oregon marine alga to contain 12R,13S-diHETE, its ready availability and richness of 12-LO metabolites make it a good choice for further studies aimed at probing the biosynthetic mechanism by which this metabolite is formed."
