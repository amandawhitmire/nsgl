14,Abstract:,"The Oregon Coast, is, in its entirely, one of the state' s most spectacular natural resources. As is the case for many of the coastal areas in this country, the Oregon Coast has in recent times experienced increased and often conflicting use pressures. The focal points of these pressures are the 14 or so estuaries and the beaches. What should be preserved? What can be developed? Who should weigh the opposing interests? Is the Coast a 'local or a state-wide concern'? With these sorts of questions in mind, the 1971 Oregon Legislature created the Oregon Coastal Conservation and Development Commission OCC & DC! and charged the Commission with the task of reporting back to the 1975 legislative session armed with policy and implementation proposals. The Ocean Resources Law Program attempted, by sponsoring the symposium whose proceedings follow this note, to provide a forum where some of the major questions facing the OCC & DC could be discussed. Members of the OCC & DC kindly consented to serve as moderators and chairmen for the symposium sessions."
