11,Abstract:,"Macrophytic marine algae, commonly known as seaweeds, are a major source of food and a rich source of natural compounds. Cell or tissue suspension cultures derived from marine seaweeds offer a platform for the controlled production of biomass and these natural compounds, ultimately in bioreactor systems. In this article, reliable techniques are presented for establishing phototrophic liquid cell or tissue suspension cultures. The common characteristics of phototrophic microalgal suspension culture systems, including culture morphology, environmental requirements for culture growth, and typical growth rates are illustrated through representative culture systems developed in the author's laboratory for each of the three major phyla of marine macroalgae."
