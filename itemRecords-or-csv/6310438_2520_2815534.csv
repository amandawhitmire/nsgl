11,Abstract:,"The need for renewable energy has emerged at the same time that the demand for nearshore ocean ""real estate"" seems to be growing. The last frontier - the ocean - is being expropriated. While the potential of economic gain through job creation and or access to clean renewable energy is enticing for coastal communities, there is also a deep fear that wave energy development is essentially replacing one ""renewable"" industry - fishing / seafood - with another. The space desired for renewable energy generation - flat, sandy bottom - is often some of the most productive crabbing grounds. Therefore, this new industry has become just one more competitor for an already-​stressed fishing industry. In addition, wave energy generation is a relatively new industry in the US and the world. The processes for permitting have been unclear and complicated. The processes for community involvement are being designed and implemented on the fly. Add to this the fact that political leaders are striving to make Oregon ""the leader"" in wave energy development and a process that is moving at an accelerated pace. Coastal communities of place, and communities of interest like commercial and recreational fishing, need to successfully engage in this issue. Thoughtfully-​designed, educational outreach and engagement is vital to raise awareness and to encourage involvement. This paper describes challenges and successes in engaging these stakeholders, and the progress toward developing systems for working together and making sure that diverse perspectives and needs are heard. In short, designing and implementing a slow-but-steady movement to support coastal communities that are informed and involved in creating the future of our coasts and ocean."
