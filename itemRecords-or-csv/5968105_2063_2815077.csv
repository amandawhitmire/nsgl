16,Abstract:,"The acquisition of a non-invasive means to qualitatively determine gender and level of maturation in young salmonids is of increasing interest to hatcheries and those working to preserve salmon runs. Short-â€‹wavelength near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been widely applied in the food industry and shows potential for application in biological systems. Experimental evidence confirms that NIR light can penetrate through the skin, scales, and muscle in the ventral region of the fish and reach the gonadal tissue. Also, distinct gonadal signal features were found that distinguish egg tissue from testis tissue. Results of Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy and Principal Component Analysis employed to analyze spectra demonstrate that a sound classification of gender and maturation can be achieved."
