11,Abstract:,"Formal study of the diseases of fish is a relatively new discipline whose initial focus has been on economically important species. As with many plant and animal diseases, pathogens of aquatic animals often thrive within intensively cultured captive host populations in which the devastating effects of infectious diseases quickly become apparent. Although much remains to be learned about the causes and ecology of diseases among populations of wild fish, concerns for native stock are bringing this subject increased attention. This paper provides an overview."
