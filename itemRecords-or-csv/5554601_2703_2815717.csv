11,Abstract:,"It is well documented that stress affects the immune systems of fish. In all vertebrates, stress-induced increases in circulating glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol and corticosterone) alter a wide variety of immune functions. Stress and treatment with glucocorticoids can change the number and composition of circulating leukocytes. The objectives of this study were to determine if there were changes in the number of leukocytes in the blood, thymi, spleens, or anterior kidneys of juvenile coho salmon after acute stress and, if changes were detected, to determine if short- or long-term treatment with exogenous cortisol could cause similar changes."
