9,Abstract:,"No new Pacific oysters recruiting to oyster ""beds."" Shellfish larvae dying at commercial hatcheries. Corrosive, acidified seawater measured for the first time off the Pacific Coast. These and other observations, beginning in 2005, prompted members of the West Coast shellfish industry to seek help from scientists to explore what is causing the shellfish losses, what role ocean acidification and other factors might be playing, and how to adapt to sustain West Coast shellfish resources. An organizing committee planned a face-to-face meeting as a logical first step to frame the problems, assess what information is available and what is needed, and to suggest future actions. The West Coast Ocean Acidification-​Shellfish Workshop was held July 7-8, 2010, in Costa Mesa, CA, with 51 invited participants, including biologists, oceanographers, state and federal agency managers, industry members and representatives from the Sea Grant Programs in Washington, Oregon and California. This brochure summarizes the information shared and recommended next steps."
