14,Abstract:,"Histamine-​producing bacteria were isolated from albacore stored at 0, 25,30, and 37 deg. C. Histamine production was confirmed by high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis. The optimum temperature for growth of histamine-​producing bacteria was 25 deg. C. The bacterium producing the highest level of histamine was identified as ""Morganella morganii"". The ""M. morganii"" isolate was inoculated into tuna fish infusion broth medium, and the effect of temperature was determined for microbial growth and formation of histamine and other biogenic amines. Results indicate that the toxicological effect of histamine may be enhanced by the proliferation of bacteria capable of producing both histamine and other potentiating biogenic amines."
