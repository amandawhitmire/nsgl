11,Abstract:,"The purpose of this report is to describe the results of our histological studies on the adult oysters and review previous studies associated with diseases and parasites of Korean oysters. Further, I was asked by the Oregon Cooperative Oyster Marketing Association (OCOMA) members and OSU Marine Advisory Program (MAP) personnel to provide, if possible, answers to the following two questions: what is the history of past studies conducted on Korean oysters; and, have similar studies been conducted on Japanese oysters? I would like to acknowledge the gracious assistance of personnel from the NMFS Oxford laboratory; their cooperation has been invaluable."
