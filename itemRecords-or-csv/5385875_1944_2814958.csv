11,Abstract:,"The authors present and investigate the equilibrium behavior of an age-structured version of the Ricker stock-​recruitment model specifically tailored to the complex nature of chinook life histories and fisheries. Model parameters represent fundamental sex-specific life history traits that characterize and distinguish chinook stocks. The importance of the Ricker ""alpha"" parameter and sex-specific maturity schedules in determining exploitation rates for maximum sustained yield and stock collapse are demonstrated as is the fact that catch/catch plus escapement is a poor indicator of exploitation rate for chinook. Analysis is relevant to recent discussions about the effects of size- and age-selective fisheries, and model predictions of changes in age structure attributable to fishing are compared with documented changes in chinook stocks over the past few decades."
