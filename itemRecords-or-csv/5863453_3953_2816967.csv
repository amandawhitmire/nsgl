10,Abstract:,"Between 1973 and 1996, shrimp processor margins declined by 56% for peeled shrimp, 30% for headless-​shell-​on shrimp and 39% for the breaded shrimp. Overall processor margins for the three products declined by 35%. The goal of this research was to examine the impact of shrimp processor performance (processor's margins) on industry structure (number of firms). Specifically, entry, exit and firm size distribution in the southeast United States shrimp processing industry was evaluated using a Markov model. Relevant literature was reviewed; data and estimation issues are discussed; empirical results are presented; and the findings are discussed."
