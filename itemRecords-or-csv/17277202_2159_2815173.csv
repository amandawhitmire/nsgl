8,Abstract:,"In Rhode Island, the public right to use the shoreline exists below the mean high water mark. This use has been discussed and identified in both the State’s judicial and legislative realms. However, in many cases the mean high water mark is indistinguishab​le or covered by water. Often the public may traverse the shore to partake in protected uses, such as fishing or swimming, while unknowingly trespassing onto private property. Historic continuous public use of the shoreline above the mean high water mark may establish a customary public right to access the shore laterally. The Oregon Supreme Court has already successfully adopted this approach by determining that the public has an existing right to lateral access on the dry sand based on custom. Thus, this report provides evidence, mainly through photographs and illustrations, of historic public use of Rhode Island’s shoreline above mean high water to support a customary right of lateral access and use."
