10,Abstract:,"This is the last of three articles comparing the legal regimes for ocean resources management in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the U.S. In the U.S., EEZ resources management not only is divided intergovernmentâ€‹ally between the federal and state levels, but is also highly fragmented among different agencies at each level. Ocean policymakers in the executive branch have resisted proposed comprehensive EEZ legislation that would improve cooperation between agencies and between levels of government. Instead, they make piecemeal amendments to the many federal statutes governing EEZ resource use. While none of the four countries studied in this series of articles has instituted multiple-use management on an EEZ-wide basis, each has done so for particular zones or specially designated areas. Meaningful coastal state participation appears essential to the success of any improvements in the management of multiple use in the EEZ."
