12,Abstract:,"Adults of the globally invasive green crabs ""Carcinus maenas"" and ""C. aestuarii"" can generally be distinguished in the field by three diagnostic characteristicsâ€‹: the shape of the copulatory appendages (pleopods) in the male, the shape of the frontal area between the eyes, and the carapace width to length ratio. This report provides details about all known distinctions and evaluates the usefulness of each in a field setting."
