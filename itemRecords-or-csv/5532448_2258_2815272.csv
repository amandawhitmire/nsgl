11,Abstract:,"For centuries, marine algae have been applied to croplands as a method for improving yields and plant vigor. Some of these benefits have been attributed to the auxin content of the seaweeds; a variety of tryptophan metabolites have been reported from bacteria, animals, and plants, including red algae. In this study, a plant growth regulatory substance, 3-​(hydroxyacetyl) indole, and two related tryptophan metabolites were isolated from the marine red alga ""Prionitis lanceolata""; 3-​(hydroxyacetyl) indole stimulates lettuce-​seedling root growth."
