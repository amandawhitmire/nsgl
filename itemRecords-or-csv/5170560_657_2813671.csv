11,Abstract:,"The Pacific salmon industry established a vigorous growth pattern in the first 30 years of its existence, The salmon were abundant and easy to catch and the market for canned salmon seemed insatiable. Eco​nomic theory attempts to uncover the basic relationships of cause and effect hidden by the diverse surface manifestation of economic activity in the marketplace. Abstract models of industry have been constructed for this purpose but the diversity of organizational form between industry groups precludes an effective, universal theory. Market structure analysis consists of isolating those significant organizational ​ characteristics​ of a market which may affect the behavior of firms participating in that market, These firms organize the resources for the production of goods and services and allocate those resources. The salmon industry is particularly unique, both in organizational characteristics and geographic location. It would, therefore, seem logical to hypothesize that the industry is acted upon by certain unique forces. If policy measures are to be formulated for this important fishery, they should be founded upon a sound informational base, including a comprehensive description of the organizational structure and its relevant variables. This study does not propose changing market structure analysis; it does, however, argue that each industry may have unique characteristics and forces which will shape the structure of that industry. These factors may be completely outside the control of the decision makers within the industry. The traditional approach to market structure analysis is founded upon the assumption that decision makers within an industry have control of their destinies and policies are formulated toward that end. This researcher takes strong exception to that concept. This monograph represents the first in a two-part series dealing with the impact of a natural resource upon the market structure of the industry it services as a factor of production."
