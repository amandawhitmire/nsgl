16,Abstract:,"The International Wood Products Company has proposed to construct and operate a multi-product integrated plant for the manufacture and processing of hardwoods in Reedsport, Oregon. The company signed an agreement with Port of Umpqua, May 14, 1974, which stated that the Port would lease six acres of land adjacent to the harbor and would, through its authority, issue tax-​exempt industrial revenue bonds to finance the construction of the proposed plant facility. In addition, the agreement, which expired December 10, l974, provided that International Wood Products arrange for revenue bond financing. In view of the potential economic, social, and environmental, impact of the proposed plant on the Reedsport area and the inability of International Wood Products to arrange revenue bond financing because of national economic conditions, the Port of Umpqua Commission decided that an independent assessment of these impacts could provide useful information. Consequently, students in a regional economics course at Oregon State University attempted to assess the impacts and implications of the proposed plant for Reedsport. The students presented their preliminary findings and recommendations to the Port on December 5, 1974."
