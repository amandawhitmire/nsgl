13,Abstract:,"Participants in this workshop discussed recent developments in exporting, including countertrade, with an emphasis on fisheries and seafood-related commodities. (However, a large part of the workshop centered on general trade topics which may be of interest to people outside the fisheries/seafo​od sector.) Representatives from the private sector, government, and universities were encouraged to view this workshop as a forum for discussing ideas, sharing experiences, and posing questions. Emphasis was on recent and innovative approaches to challenges facing exporters in the Pacific Northwest. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. Pacific Northwest trade in a global context. Michael Martin pp. 3-8. 2. An update on nontariff barriers to trade. Richard Johnston and Robert McMahon pp. 9-18. 3. Current financing strategies for seafood and related products. Warren Banks pp. 21-28. 4. Expecting the unexpected: practical advice for countertraders. Calvin Van Pelt pp. 29-39. 5. Recent developments in legislation affecting international trade. Carol Emery pp. 40-44. 6. Panel: keeping a perspective on nonfinancial factors influencing countertrade and exports. Tony Burget, Kirk Beiningen, and Frank Dausz pp. 45-66. 7. Panel: applying current trends to international trade in fisheries and related products. Terry Elwell, Todd Shaw, and Larz Malony pp. 67-76."
