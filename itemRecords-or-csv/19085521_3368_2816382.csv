16,Abstract:,"Gelatinous zooplankton can dominate the dynamics of marine ecosystems; can have major ecological, social, and economicimpacts​; are often indicative of broader ecosystem perturbations; and are increasingly being harvested by humans. Yetfisheries scientists typically do not monitor these taxa on a regular basis, despite the existence of clear rationales and evenmandated authorizations to do so. Notably, the costs of monitoring jellyfish during regular fisheries research cruises wouldbe a small increase over the cost of running a large fishery survey and a small fraction of the costs caused by impacts fromthese taxa. As ecosystems experience increasing pressures from climate change and fisheries, we recommend consideringrout​ine monitoring before some future jellyfish-​associated crisis arises."
