11,Abstract:,"The principal objectives of this study were to isolate and identify the factors governing the demand for domestically produced rainbow trout in a representative West Coast market--the greater Los Angeles Area-- and assess the impact (if any) of the introduction of pan-size salmon on that demand The report begins with some observations on the development of salmonid aquaculture and then turns to a discussion of the Los Angeles market for rainbow trout. For the purposes of this study, the term aquaculture is intended to describe the fish culture technique wherein an organism is hatched, reared, and ultimately harvested under the constant control and management of a production facility's staff.
