9,Abstract:,"Marine algae are a rich source of bioactive and structurally novel compounds. Studies of algal metabolites have led to new medicinal agents, pharmacological probes for biochemical studies, as well as a greater understanding of our environment. The current need for new pharmaceutical agents has prompted our investigations of several genera of algae which displayed crude extract biological activity and/or unique thin-layer chromatographic characteristics​. This research utilized modern chromatographic techniques coupled with spectroscopic analysis including IR, UV, MS, as well as 1-D and 2-D NMR. Agardhilactone, a novel tricyclic oxylipin containing 5- lactone, cyclopentane and epoxide rings and a conjugated diene, was isolated from the marine red alga Agardhiella subulata. Its structure, including partial stereochemistry​, was determined by NMR analysis of agardhilactone acetate and GC-MS analysis of menthoxycarbony​l derivatives. Agardhilactone represents a new oxylipin structure class, distinguished by the unprecedented position of the cyclopentyl ring, C6 to C10, within a 20-carbon chain framework. Kalkipyrone, a novel alpha-​methoxy-​bet,beta-​ dimethyl-​gamma-​pyrone linked to an alkyl side chain, was isolated from an assemblage of the cyanobacteria Lyngbya majuscula and Tolypothrix sp. Its structure, including stereochemistry​, was determined by NMR, UV, and IR analysis and by GC-MS analysis of menthoxycaronyl derivatives. Kalkipyrone displays toxicity to brine shrimp (LD50=1 ug/ml) and gold fish (LD50=2 ug/ml) and is structurally related to several ""Streptomyces"" metabolites, the actinopyrones."
