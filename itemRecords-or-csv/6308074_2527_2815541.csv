8,Abstract:,"The director of Oregon Sea Grant, Stephen Brandt, posted to this blog site during his week-long research cruise while mapping and quantifying the effects of last summer's Deepwater Horizon oil spill on the marine ecology of the northern Gulf of Mexico. The cruise, supported by a National Science Foundation rapid-response grant, included scientific collaborators from Oregon State University, the University of Maryland, and Eastern Carolina University. The scientists have collected data from the same region in seven years of research cruises there."
