13,Abstract:,"Since the major capsid protein, VP2, of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus contains the major virus- neutralizing epitopes, the possible role for glycosylation in capsid formation and antigenicity was examined. The carbohydrate content of the virion proteins was determined by chemical detection, pulse-chase experiments, (3H)mannose labeling, and alteration of protein migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-​polyacrylamide gels after tunicamycin treatment. No glycosylation of any virion protein was observed when the carbohydrate nature of the glycoprotein of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus was detected."
