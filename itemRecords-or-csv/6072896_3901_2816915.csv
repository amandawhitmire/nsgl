11,Abstract:,"Since its inadvertent release into the Snake River in 1987, the rapid range expansion of the New Zealand mudsnail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, across many western rivers and lakes has been attributed to ""hitchhiking"" on wading gear, as well as on recreational boats and trailers. Resource managers have attempted to develop effective protocols for eradicating P. antipodarum from field equipment and fishing gear as a means of controlling this vector of introduction. Freezing has been identified as a potential treatment option. This experiment examines the use of dry ice in portable coolers as a method of decontaminating New Zealand mudsnails from equipment by generating temperatures well below freezing. Our results indicate that: 1) freezing temperatures below -3 deg. C can be achieved using dry ice in a portable cooler; 2) on wading gear, over 97% P. antipodarum mortality was achieved with a 4 hour exposure period; 3) due to stratification of the air temperature within a cooler, the effectiveness of this approach is critically dependent on the placement of the dry ice at the top of the cooler; and 4) extremely cold conditions have potential to temporarily make rubber gear brittle, but no gear damage was detected after exposure. These results indicate that dry ice can be effectively used to eradicate P. antipodarum from field gear based on the protocol for proper placement, quantity and exposure time. The use of dry ice as a means of decontaminating equipment provides additional field options for minimizing the spread of the New Zealand mudsnail."
