12,Abstract:,"A large number of oxylipins (oxygenated compounds which are formed from fatty acids by reaction(s) involving at least one step of mono- or dioxygenase-​catalyzed oxygenation) have been isolated from various marine algae in the last decade. For example, eicosatetraenoi​c and eicosapentaenoi​c acids have been isolated from the red algae ""Farlowia mollis"" and ""Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis""; the latter also contained these diols esterified in mono- and digalactosyldia​cylglycerides. This paper is concerned with the mechanism of formation of dihydroxy fatty acids in ""G. lemaneiformis"" and with the existence of a novel hydroperoxide isomerase activity in this alga."
