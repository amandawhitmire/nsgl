11,Abstract:,"Columnaris disease, caused by the bacterium ""Flexibacter columnaris"", causes losses in a wide variety of cultured and feral freshwater fishes. Character of the disease suggests that the production of extracellular proteases may be an important virulence mechanism for the bacterium. In this study researchers identified extracellular proteases produced by ""F. columnaris"" isolates."
