12,Abstract:,"Freshly cooked Pacific shrimp, vacuum-packed in cans fitted with monitoring instruments, were frozen under industrial conditions. Surface heat transfer coefficients were determined experimentally using aluminium cylinders. Freezing times were measured and also calculated using Plank's equation and the formulae of Cleland and Earle. The investigation indicated that the vacuum level had little effect on the freezing time and that freezing time essentially doubled when cans were enclosed in a commercial carton. For the prediction of freezing times, Cleland and Earle's method was more accurated than Plank's for the tests performed, with predicted values within 10% of measured values."
