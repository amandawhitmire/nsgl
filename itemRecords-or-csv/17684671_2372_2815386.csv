10,Abstract:,"This exhibit, which consists of a large interpretive banner and fish tanks, focuses on the ornamental fish industry in Brazil’s Rio Negro, the largest tributary of the Amazon River. Through photos and text, the banner describes the steps in the supply chain – from the initial catching of the fish to their arrival at pet stores around the world. It also explains that experts with Oregon Sea Grant, Oregon State University and the nonprofit Project Piaba have been helping fishers and exporters learn better ways to collect, handle, feed and house the fish to ensure that they are healthy."
