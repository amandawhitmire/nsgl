15,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of setting conditions (25 deg C for 2 h or 40 deg C for 30 min) and combining of microbial transglutaminas​e (MTGase) and high pressure processing (HPP) on the mechanical properties of heat induced gels obtained from paste from arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias). Treatments included fish paste control without added MTGase, fish paste incubated with MTGase but not pressurized (MTGase + cooking), fish paste incubated with MTGase and pressurized at 600 MPa for 5 min (MTGase + HPP + cooking) and fish paste pressurized at 600 MPa for 5 min and incubated with MTGase (HPP + MTGase + cooking). The controls and the treated samples were then subjected to one of two thermal treatments: 90 deg C for 15 min or 60 deg C for 30 min before cooking at 90 deg C for 15 min. Samples of fish paste heated at 60 deg C before cooking could not be used to prepare gels for texture profile analysis (TPA). TPA showed that pressurization improved the mechanical properties of gels made from paste treated with MTGase and set at 25 deg C. The opposite was observed for samples set at 40 deg C. Setting at 40 deg C appeared to induce proteolytic degradation of myofibrillar proteins."
