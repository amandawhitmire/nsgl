12,Abstract:,"Histamine formation in fresh albacore was studied. Whole albacore left on deck up to 1 day contained negligible levels of histamine (<0.4 mg/100#g muscle). When they were abused at ambient temperatures for 1-4 days, 2 of 9 samples showed histamine levels>5 mg/100#g. Histamine level was not affected by onboard handling techniques studied, i.e., bleeding and spiking. Enzymatic assay was compared to the AOAC fluorometric method for histamine analysis. Enzymatic results showed a good correlation with those of the AOAC method. Although the enzymatic method tended to overestimate histamine at levels <1 mg/100#g, it was rapid, simple, and suitable as a screening method for routine analysis."
