8,Abstract:,"""Podcasting the HMSC."" Visitors to OSU's Hatfield Marine Science Visitor Center in Newport can now tune in to video tours that describe the center's exhibits, the work of HMSC researchers, and what goes on behind the scenes to keep the public aquarium healthy and functioning.... ""Blogging Antarctica."" When Oregon Sea Grant marine educator Bill Hanshumaker was getting ready for his second trip to Antarctica with the NOAA-sponsored Sounds of the Southern Ocean research team, he knew he wanted to keep an online journal to describe the cruise and its discoveries.... ""Exploring Beach Recovery."" How do beaches recover after storms? Until very recently, natural beach recovery was poorly understood. Tuba Ozkan-Haller and Merrick Haller bring their own beach to the Hinsdale Wave Research Lab at Oregon State University to learn more about this process. Equipped with an arsenal of state-​of-​the-​art electronic sensors, remote cameras, and 1,000 yards of sand, they hope to develop new tools that can help predict how beaches will recover. ""Wave Power."" The United States consumes more electricity than any other country in the world. More than half of that energy is produced from nonrenewable fossil fuels. A clean, renewable, and readily available source of electric power would be a great environmental and economic asset. Some forward-​thinking scientists believe we need look no further than the pent-up energy in the ocean waves that constantly pound the nation's shores...."
