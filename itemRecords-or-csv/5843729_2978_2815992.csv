17,Abstract:,"The authors report the development of an IHNV vaccine produced by a new protein production system based on the bacterium ""Caulobacter crescentus."" The subunit vaccines that were tested contain a 184 amino acid segment of the IHNV glycoprotein in different fusion arrangements with the ""C. crescentus"" S-layer protein. Relative percent survival of 26 to 34% was demonstrated in rainbow trout fry for a vaccine that contained the 184 amino acid segment of the IHNV glycoprotein fused to the C-terminal one-quarter of the S-layer protein."
