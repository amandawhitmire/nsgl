15,Abstract:,"Ocean engineering involves the application of the tools of traditional engineering disciplines for planning, design, construction, inspection and maintenance of systems used for developing or protecting the oceanic environment. These systems may be employed in the estuarine, nearshore or coastal environments as well as on the surface, intermediate waters, bottom and sub-bottom of the ocean To promote greater understanding of oceanic engineering and systems engineering concepts at Oregon State University, futuristic and realistic design problems are assigned to the Ocean Engineering Design class, CE 573. During the 1971 spring term, the design problem concerned alternative sitings of a near shore nuclear power plant. Key Words: Offshore site selection criteria; Environmental parameters; Conceptual power plant design."
