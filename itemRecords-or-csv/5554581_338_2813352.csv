9,Abstract:,"Cold, turbid, and wave-tossed, the Pacific Ocean, where it comes in contact with Oregon's spectacular shore, is a seemingly inhospitable place for life. But as ""Oregon's Ocean"" shows in graphic detail, life is abundant beneath the waves. An octopus dashes across the ocean bottom, gooseneck barnacles feed on floating plankton, shorecrabs scavenge whatever they can find. Dive into this largely unknown world and experience what only experienced divers have seen before. Originally broadcast on the Public Broadcasting Network, the 28-minute film is suitable for junior high school through adult audiences."
