10,Abstract:,"The capacity of certain salmonids to resist infection and disease caused by the myxosporean ""Ceratomyxa shasta"" is well known. Observations of differential mortality among strains suggest intraspecies differences in susceptibility developed as a result of selective pressure in waters where the parasite is enzootic. Research efforts have identified resistant strains for use in stocking programs and examined the heritability of the trait. This paper reviews the research on resistance of salmonids to ""C. shasta"", the conclusions drawn from these studies, and how this information has been applied."
