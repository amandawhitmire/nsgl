13,Abstract:,"Rockfish have a gas-filled organ, called a swim bladder, that allows the fish to control its buoyancy. When rockfish are brought to the surface quickly, the swim bladder can overexpand and burst. The expanding gas from the swim bladder can push the stomach out of the mouth and the intestine out the anus. These symptoms may get worse with time at the surface. The fish may also float on the surface, unable to dive back to the bottom. Recompressing or venting the fish can increase the fish's chance of survival. In ""Release Methods for Rockfish"", the authors use text and photos to demonstrate how to reverse some of the damage done by the expanding gas. They also suggest ways to avoid the problem in the first place. The publication should be useful to both commercial and recreational fishers."
