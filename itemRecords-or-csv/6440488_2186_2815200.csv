9,Abstract:,"This research uses the Institutional Development Analysis (IDA) framework to examine the relationships between the individual levels of enforcement and the commercial trawl fishermen in Newport, Oregon, to determine if there is a difference in relationships and whether those differences impact compliance. While a difference in the relationships between the varied levels of enforcement and the fishermen was noted, this difference did not constitute a shift in compliance. Compliance remained high at all levels of enforcement. The real difference in relationships between enforcement and the trawl fishermen was found to be within the make-up of the fleet and it is responsible for a variety of outcomes that have the potential to impact not only the fishery, but the Newport community, as a whole."
