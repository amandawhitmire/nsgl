11,Abstract:,"Whey protein concentrates were evaluated as functional ingredients to improve the textural properties of surimi seafoods made from Pacific whiting. Whey protein concentrate ingredients were promising because they remained economically competitive with potato starch and beef plasma protein, which are commonly used as ingredients in whiting surimi seafoods."
