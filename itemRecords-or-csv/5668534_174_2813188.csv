13,Abstract:,"Many communities on the Oregon coast are experiencing significant demographic and economic transitions. These transitions have not only disrupted the social and economic status quo, but have also put new pressures on county and municipal governments. Research has been designed to provide coastal residents and governments with more information about the impact of tourism development in particular and demographic and economic transitions in general. The fundamental goal of this research is to provide information that will help communities develop policies for increasing positive impacts while reducing negative impacts. It involved a survey of residents in eight Oregon coast communities used as case studies. Results are reported here."
