13,Abstract:,"This webinar features Kelsey Lane, a doctoral student in the College of  Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University. Kelsey studies foraminifera, a type of microscopic plankton. She earned a  master's degree in marine resource management from OSU in 2020. 	Raised in South Dakota, Kelsey earned a bachelor's degree from Brown University in Rhode Island. As an undergraduate, she interned in Florida, where she photographed dolphins to identify them by their fins.  She was also an intern in Alaska where she counted algae and critters under kelp on the shore. Additionally, she sailed around the world for seven years as a technician and educator aboard ships in the Sea Education Association's semester-at-sea program."
