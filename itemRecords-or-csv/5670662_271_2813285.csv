Other topics that have an effect on our commercial fisheries will also be discussed. A major topic will be featured in each issue of the Newsletter. The major topic in V. 1 No. 1 is a discussion of stabilization systems used in fishing vessels. Other topics include: A Sea Grant Program in Oregon; Dungeness crab study; Fishboat sanitation; Anti-fouling coatings for boats; Government fleet aid programs; and Shrimp trawl research."
