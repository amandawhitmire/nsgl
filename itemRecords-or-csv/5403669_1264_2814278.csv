13,Abstract:,"Ports are important to most coastal and river-oriented economies. Oregon State University conducts comprehensive port management studies, including in depth analyses of port management, finance, operations, and port development. This publication is a compilation and summary of some of the most significant findings of 11 different comprehensive port management studies conducted in the past 4 years. While these findings are not substitutes for the specific findings that would result from a comprehensive management study of your own port, they do indicate the kinds of opportunities that are common to most ports. Results are described in the form of a report to the Port of Beaver, a purely fictitious port."
