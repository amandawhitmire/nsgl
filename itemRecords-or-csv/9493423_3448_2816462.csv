12,Abstract:,"Kodama and his colleagues presented a classification theorem for exact soliton solutions of the quasi-​two-​dimensional Kadomtsev-​Petviashvili (KP) equation. The classification theorem is related to non-negative Grassmann manifold, Gr(N;M) that is parameterized by a unique cord diagram based on the derangement of the permutation group. The cord diagram can infer the asymptotic behavior of the solution with arbitrary number of line solitons. This study presents the realization of a variety of the KP soliton formations in the laboratory environment. The experiments are performed in a water tank designed and constructed for precision experiments for long waves. The tank is equipped with a directional-​wave maker, capable of generating arbitrary-​shaped multi-​dimensional waves. Temporal and spatial variations of water-surface profiles are captured using the Laser-Induced Fluorescent method (a nonintrusive optical measurement technique with sub-millimeter precision). The experiments yield accurate anatomy of the KP soliton formations and their evolution behaviors. Physical interpretations are discussed for a variety of KP soliton formations predicted by the classification theorem."
