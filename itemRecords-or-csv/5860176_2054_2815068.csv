16,Abstract:,"Offshore rockfish fisheries that have suffered a significant decline in the eastern North Pacific, include canary rockfish (""Sebastes pinniger"") widow rockfish (""S. entomelas""), Pacific Ocean perch (""S. alutus"") yellowtail rockfish (""S. flavidus""), and boccacio (""S. paucispinus""). About 30% of rockfish examined in a recent survey were infected with the chlamydia-like agent responsible for epitheliocystis​. Other diseases have also been reported. In 2000, during stock surveys of demersal fish, research scientists conducted disease examinations of these fish to elucidate possible roles that diseases play in the demise of some of these stocks. A consistently high prevalence of ""Ichthyophonus"" was found in the liver, kidney, and spleen of ""S. flavidus"" and ""S. alutus."" The effect of ""Ichthyophonus"" on these stocks is unknown, but the possibility that it has some deleterious impact should be considered because of the prevalence and severity of infection, and associated tissue damage."
