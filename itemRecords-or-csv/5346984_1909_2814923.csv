12,Abstract:,"Even before the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, the U.S. and Australia had authorized the establishment of marine protected areas as far seaward as the edge of the continental shelf. Both nations have taken a number of measures which also accord with Article 194 of the LOS Convention. This report explores the federal-state relationships in marine conservation and the resolution of multiple-use conflicts in the U.S. and Australia. It discusses New Zealand marine protected areas and Australian approaches to marine conservation. Important considerations in the drafting of legislation and regulations for marine areas are specified."
