10,Abstract:,"Processors considering the production of surimi need reliable estimates of production costs. An important component of these costs is energy consumption. Documented power consumption rates for individual food processing operations are applied to surimi processing, freezing, and cold storage. Electrical power consumption is predicted to be 314 and 272 kWh/t (285 and 247 kWh/ton) for representative surimi plants in Oregon and Alaska, respectively, during summer operation. The influencing factors for each operation are identified."
