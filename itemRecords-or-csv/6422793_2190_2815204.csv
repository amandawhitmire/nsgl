10,Abstract:,"The devastating 9.0 earthquake and resulting tsunami that struck Japan on March 11, 2011 claimed nearly 16,000 lives, injured 6,000, destroyed or damaged infrastructure and caused between $195-$310 billion in damages. It also released a pulse of debris estimated to be over 5 million tons, of which approximately 30% (~1.5million tons) is likely to still be afloat. As of June 2012, the floating debris, predicted to begin arriving with the Fall 2012 storms, has begun to come ashore on the west coast of North America, with a large ~165 ton floating dock appearing on Agate beach in Newport on June 5. The dock and its fouling community garnered extensive media coverage, and turned international attention to Oregon as a site of tsunami debris research and management. The threat of invasive species attached to tsunami marine debris is a critical and unforeseen risk that emerged with the beaching of the 66' long dock that drifted from Japan. Dr. Chan will discuss the response and management of the risk of invasive species introduction in Oregon, and lessons learned from the beaching of the dock on Agate Beach."
