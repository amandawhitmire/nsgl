21,Abstract:,"Viral vaccines for animals reared in the aquatic environment must meet the criteria of efficacy, safety, cost effectiveness, and the easy application before the aquaculture industry will accept vaccination as a control strategy. Investigators have developed recombinant vaccines that meet the initial criteria of safety and ease of application at an acceptable cost. However, consistent efficacy under farm-rearing conditions has been a real problem. Another is the incomplete understanding of the protective immune response in fish and shellfish. This review discusses these problems and some of the different approaches investigators have taken to produce viral vaccines for aquaculture."
