16,Abstract:,"This 36 by 48 inch poster was designed to use as a guide for agency and Sea Grant personnel who were making a presentation to teachers in the classroom. It seems that without understanding the full implications of what they are doing, teachers have been ordering from biological supply houses species, such as the rusty crayfish and Brazilian elodia, that are invasive in some parts of the country. After the class is through with the species, the students and teachers often release them into local waters, thus contributing to a growing problem in the U.S. Agency and Sea Grant presenters are trying to alert teachers to this problem. Although Oregon Sea Grant made only enough posters to cover the needs of the presenters, many other agencies and groups around the country have been either copying or adapting the poster and mass producing it."
