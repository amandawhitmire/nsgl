16,Abstract:,"Management strategies for parasites with complex lifecycles typically target not the parasite itself, but one of the alternate hosts. Ceratomyxa shasta is a myxozoan parasite of salmonids that requires a freshwater polychaete Manayunkia speciosa to complete its lifecycle. In the Klamath River, CA/OR, C. shasta causes significant mortality in juvenile salmon, imposing social and economic losses on sport and tribal fisheries. An interest in manipulating the polychaete host to decrease the abundance of C. shasta in this system has therefore developed. Manayunkia speciosa is a small (3mm) benthic filter-feeding worm that attaches itself perpendicularly to substrate through construction of a flexible tube. There are several hydropower dams on the Klamath River and pulsed flows as well as gravel augmentation have been proposed as methods to decrease M. speciosa populations through scouring action. The presence of the dams, and their projected deconstruction in 2020 have also raised questions of whether the dams are influencing disease dynamics and what changes might be anticipated with their removal. One hypothesis is that dam construction has increased polychaete habitat by modifying the natural flow regime, leading to amplification of C. shasta. Unfortunately, there are limited data on the life-cycle and habitat requirements of M. speciosa or the influence of streamflow regime and hydraulics on their population dynamics. This work aims to address the data need by characterizing the physical habitat utilized by M. speciosa and applying a hydraulic model at a study site to investigate how habitat changes under a range of flow conditions. Populations of M. speciosa are also being monitored year round for density and infection prevalence to better understand the influence of seasonal changes in temperature and flow."
