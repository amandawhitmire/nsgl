12,Abstract:,"Biological invasions are becoming a serious problem worldwide. Aquatic invasive species can be stopped through early detection and a quick response. This educational video gives an overview of the problem and provides identification and natural history information about one significant threat in the Pacific Northwest, the Chinese mitten crab. This important information is intended for aquatic monitoring staff and volunteers, field educators, aquaculture operators, and all others who spend time in lakes, rivers, and estuaries."
