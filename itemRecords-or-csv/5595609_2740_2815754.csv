11,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to undertake a series of flume experiments to investigate the processes of selective entrainment and differential transport of sand containing a mixture of light and heavy minerals. The sediment used was obtained from the ocean beach near the mouth of the Columbia River on the northwest coast of the U.S. The flume experiments complement a field study which has documented the grain sorting that occurs as sand is transported alongshore away from the Columbia, leaving a significant black sand as a lag deposit on the beaches near the river mouth."
