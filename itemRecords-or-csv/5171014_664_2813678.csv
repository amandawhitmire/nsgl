11,Abstract:,"The application of numerical classification techniques to ichthyoplankton data is introduced and demonstrated. Data on larval fishes were classified hierarchically using polythetic agglomerative techniques. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity values were calculated from transformed data and clustered using a group average sorting strategy to obtain site, time, and species groups. This approach provides insight into complex spatial and temporal interrelationsh​ips among species of larval fish which are not evident from the traditional species-​by-​species analysis of data from ichthyoplankton surveys."
