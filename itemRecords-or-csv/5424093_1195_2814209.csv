11,Abstract:,"Observations conducted aboard commercial fishing vessels during 1985 and 1986 indicate that the current management policy for the west coast groundfish fishery results in some discard of marketable fish. Regulation-â€‹induced discard averaged 8.9% of the marketable catch of regulated species groups sampled, but significant variation in discard rates was observed among species groups, fishing strategies, and time periods. Higher discard rates tended to be promoted by low trip limits, high catch rates, and fishing strategies which caught a mixture of fish that included a large percentage of regulated species groups. Further work is in progress to more fully evaluate the current management regime in light of alternative management tools."
