13,Abstract:,"To examine the mechanisms of survival of ""Renibacterium salmoninarum"" in mononuclear phagocytes and the concomitant interactions with other leukocytes, the authors infected a primary culture of anterior kidney cells from rainbow trout with the bacterium. Electron micrography permitted observations of ""R. salmoninarum"" in association with the leukocytes over a period of 10 days, elucidating some of the mechanisms of virulence."
