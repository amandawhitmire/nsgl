14,Abstract:,"Photolithotroph​ic cell suspension cultures established from the microscopic gametophytic life phase of ""Laminaria saccharina"" produced three hydroxy fatty acids. The yields of the three ranged from 100 to 1000 micrograms product/g dry biomass. The effects of several linolenic acids on stimulating lipoxygenase oxidation are also described."
