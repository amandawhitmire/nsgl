12,Abstract:,"How seafood firms manage risks within the opportunities and constraints imposed by public policy is the subject of this work. This is especially important for fisheries because legislation requires that fisheries be managed to maximize national benefits while reducing risk, particularly in relation to conserving biological stocks. To fully evaluate the risk-return tradeoffs from portfolio diversification in seafood processing, optimal portfolio frontiers were generated for the Pacific whiting fishery using three alternative benefit functions representing the possible objectives of different interest groups (seafood brokers, fish processors, and resource managers). A comparison is then made of the optimal frontiers and portfolios generated. Comparisons with the current portfolio and resulting estimates of regulatory rent dissipation are also presented. A summary discussion considers further use of portfolio theory for addressing a wide range of risks associated with marine resource management, including the integration of private and public decision-â€‹making."
