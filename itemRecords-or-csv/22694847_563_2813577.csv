13,Abstract:,"Students in math classes often ask, “When am I ever going to use this?” This integrated math and science unit offers students an opportunity to discover for themselves why geometry in living organisms is both adaptive and essential. Lear​ning Goals: Students in grade level 7-8 will learn the following: • Marine invertebrates are aerobic organisms that take in dissolved oxygen from the surrounding seawater. • Oxygen absorption is easier when the respiratory organ has a high surface area to volume ratio. • The geometry of body and organ shapes may help predict how an animal will fare during low-oxygen environmental conditions. Lea​rning Objectives: Students will be able to: 1. Calculate the surface area to volume ratio of a variety of marine invertebrates, ​ 2. Graph and evaluate data sets to compare two populations, 3. Discuss potential impacts of hypoxia on marine invertebrates."
