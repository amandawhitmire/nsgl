13,Abstract:,"In this episode of Netcasts, we travel to Astoria to visit Pat Corcoran, coastal hazards specialist for Oregon Sea Grant Extension. Corcoran works with coastal community members and researchers around the world to prepare coastal residents for natural hazards, such as erosion and tsunamis. Corcoran talks about his experiences bringing the findings of research conducted by OSU's Peter Ruggiero to the community of Neskowin, where residents are exploring strategies to mitigate shoreline retreat. Corcoran also shares some photographs and wisdom from his recent visit to Japan, where he was able to view the aftermath of the March 2011 tsunami."
