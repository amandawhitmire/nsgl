12,Abstract:,"Disease agents are easily disseminated when fish are shipped without adequate precautions. Not only may the fish or eggs be infected, but the water and the containers may also be contaminated and therefore serve as vehicles by which pathogens can be introduced into new areas. Whether a pathogen will be transferred and successfully established in a new area depends on the fate of the shipment, the biology of the pathogen, and the presence or absence of appropriate hosts. A review of the history of major fish introductions and transfers is an important background for examining the dispersal of fish diseases. In view of this background information, examples of parasitic, bacterial, and viral agents that are thought to have been disseminated with fish are discussed along with efforts that have been made on national and international levels to minimize the risks of fish introductions and transfers."
