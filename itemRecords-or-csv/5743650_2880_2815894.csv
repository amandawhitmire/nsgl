12,Abstract:,"The gelation of surimi is largely dependent on appropriate interactions between adjacent myosin molecules. The development of myosin gels occurs at two stages during heating. Proteinases and transglutaminasâ€‹es can affect the gelation process and, consequently, the gel strength of surimi, by hydrolyzing or crosslinking myosin, respectively. Protein additives have been widely used to inhibit proteinase activity and enhance myosin crosslinking. Fish species with high proteolytic activity can be successfully utilized for surimi with the aid of protein additives."
