11,Abstract:,"In this installment of Netcasts, we visit the John L. Fryer Salmon Disease Laboratory, where Jerri Bartholomew and her team are using genetic tools to piece together a puzzle, searching for the right ways to target parasites while protecting salmon. We'll also get a glimpse at some of her artwork, including some more recent pieces in a set called ""Pages From a Naturalist Notebook."""
