11,Abstract:,"Marine reserves can be a viable component of conservation and fisheries management by restoring biodiversity and functioning ecosystems, and rebuilding fish stocks. There is evidence of increased biomass within reserves, and spillover to surrounding areas, but these effects are a function of reserve size and the extent of adult movements. My goal is to understand the movement patterns of fishes of Redfish Rocks to help determine optimal reserve size needed to balance protection with spillover, and to contribute to baseline data prior to closure. I am using acoustic telemetry to evaluate movement patterns of six species; the China Rockfish, Sebastes nebulosis, Quillback Rockfish S. maliger, Canary Rockfish S. pinniger, Copper Rockfish S. caurinus, Black Rockfish S. melanops, and Cabezon Scorpaenichthys marmoratus. Surgically implanted acoustic tags transmit coded signals identifying each fish and its depth, which are recorded when the fish swims within detection range of an acoustic receiver. An array of receivers is collecting data that will be used to test three hypotheses; (1) The marine reserve at Redfish Rocks will provide different degrees of protection to different species due to species-​specific differences in home range size and movement patterns. (2) The rate of movement between Redfish Rocks and Island Rock, similar habitat outside the reserve, is species-​dependent. (3) Habitat associations within the reserve are species-​specific. This work will provide information essential to the effective management of a network of marine reserves in Oregon state waters, and will improve our understanding of species-habitat associations."
