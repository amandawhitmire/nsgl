9,Abstract:,"Over 200 people—scientis​ts, engineers, teachers, advisory agents, graduate and undergraduate students—are working together to help make Sea Grant a reality. In principle the idea is simple: help develop Oregon's marine resources. In practice, Sea Grant takes an interdisciplina​ry, multi-​school and multi-​department approach, involving the Schools of Science, Engineering, Oceanography, Agriculture and Pharmacy at Oregon State University, the University of Oregon Law School, and Clatsop Community College. Support comes from the National Sea Grant Office, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), within the U.S. Department of Commerce. OSU Sea Grant is active in three general areas of particular interest to Oregon and the Northwest: The Food from the Sea Program, The Coastal Zone Environments Program, and the Human Resources Program. This report provides an overview of the work done at the Oregon Sea Grant College Program for 1971-1972."
