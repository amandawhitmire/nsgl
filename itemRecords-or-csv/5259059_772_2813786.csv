12,Abstract:,"This manual is about one of three programs designed for the intermediate or junior high school classroom: Level I is designed for the 4th or 5th grade classroom; Level II is designed for the 6th grade; and Level III is for the 7th and 8th grade science or social studies classroom.  ""An estuary is one of the richest places on earth."" This line sums up the ""Big Picture"" of what we're trying to convey to the learners who are involved in any of the three education programs. Students who participate in any one of the programs should leave with: 1) an understanding of what an estuary is, 2) knowledge of why an estuary is important, and 3) knowledge that estuaries change because of natural processes and human use."
