11,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the economic feasibility of producing hatchery seed in the Pacific Northwest, accommodating economic, technical, and biological factors that affect the cost of oyster seed production. In addition, costs are developed for five different Levels of output that are within current practical commercial capacities. Also, for each Level of production, costs are established for five methods of cu3tch preparation. These cost projections may serve as a guide for the analysis of casts of present or proposed oyster seed hatchery operations in the Pacific Northwest."
