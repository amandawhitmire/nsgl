12,Abstract:,"This paper describes the design and testing of a new rotary direct-drive Ocean wave energy extraction system. The device employs a contact-less force transmission system to couple a float to the power take-off mechanism made up of a ball screw, unidirectional clutch and a permanent magnet generator. Comprehensive simulation, design and testing of both the force transmission system and the ocean energy extraction system are presented along with preliminary wave flume test results of the buoy in irregular waves."
