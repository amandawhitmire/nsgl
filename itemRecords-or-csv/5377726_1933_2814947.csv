16,Abstract:,"The first naturally occurring styrylchromone, hormothamnione, was isolated from the marine cyanophyte ""Hormothamnion enteromorphoide​s""; its structure was determined by x-ray analysis. Hormothamnione is an exceptionally potent cytotoxin to cancer cells in-vitro and appears to be a selective inhibitor of RNA synthesis."
