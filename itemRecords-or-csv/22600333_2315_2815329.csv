This oral history video highlights the fishing community’s innovation and willingness to maintain a sense of optimism. This trait is key to coping with economic, environmental, regulatory and social change. This video was created from oral histories gathered through research conducted as part of the Voices Oral History Archives. Produced by Oregon State Productions."
