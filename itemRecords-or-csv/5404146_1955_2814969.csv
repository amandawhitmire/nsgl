12,Abstract:,"A new xenicane-type diterpenoid containing a carboxylic acid has been isolated from the tropical brown alga ""Dilophus guineensis"". Its structure was established via spectroscopic arguments including the use of two-dimensional proton-proton and proton-carbon COSY experiments. This new diterpene shows slight Gram-positive antimicrobial activity and is weakly ichthyotoxic."
