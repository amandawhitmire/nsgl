18,Abstract:,"To date very little research has been conducted explicitly with Oregon citizens regarding their understanding or attitudes about climate change. In this chapter we discuss results of four recent studies (all completed within the last 18 months) in the context of a behavioral change model that suggests that while individuals and groups need to know something about climate change to make appropriate behavioral changes?to either mitigate greenhouse gas emissions or adapt to changing climate?they also need to believe changing their behavior is important and worthwhile, and any barriers to behavioral change must be identified and addressed. Two of the studies examine how different groups (private and public sector professionals along the Oregon coast and County Health Department professionals) understand climate change and how it affects their professional responsibilitieâ€‹s and obligations. In general, the studies find a widespread acceptance of changing climate, although rural County Health professionals are less likely than urban professionals to accept climate change. And, in both contexts all respondents believe they have the capacity and expertise to address the most pressing impacts of climate change if barriers are removed including funding, policy changes, and management support. The other two studies surveyed members of the general public to characterize attitudes toward climate change, finding that many respondents identified climate change as an important issue facing individuals, organizations, and government agencies. The national American Values Survey also suggests a substantial portion of the population (36% nationally) is currently involved in activities directed at mitigating or adapting to climate change. While Oregonians participated in this national survey, we are unable to isolate the Oregon responses; however, a follow-up focus group was conducted in Oregon to validate the national responses. We should use the results of this survey carefully, although it does support findings of research focused only on Oregonians. These initial and small-scale studies suggest that Oregonians know something about climate change and many are likely to perceive it as a problem although they may not know all the scientific details. There are cognitive and perceptual barriers needing to be addressed if we expect individuals or groups to change behaviors for either mitigating or adapting to climate 1 Department of Sociology, Water Resources Policy and Management, Oregon State University 2 Oregon Sea Grant, Oregon State University 3 Climate Leadership Initiative, University of Oregon 4 Epidemiologist, Oregon Public Health Division, Department of Human Services 5 Masters in Public Policy Program, Oregon State University 6 Climate Leadership Initiative, University of Oregon 7 Department of Political Science, Masters in Public Policy, Oregon State University 8 Climate Leadership Initiative, University of Oregon change, although there appears to be general acceptance of, and desire for, government policies to direct such behavioral change. Recent projects conducted by the Climate Leadership Initiative (CLI) examined the impacts of climate change on cultural and tribal resources, and the built environment more generally. While a lack of understanding and awareness persists about Oregon tribes' vulnerability and capacity to adapt to current and projected climate change, dependency on natural resources, confinement to small portions of reservation land, and existing stressors will likely increase their vulnerability to climate change impacts (CLI and NCCSP 2010). Projected climate changes in precipitation rates and temperatures are likely to threaten the integrity of the built environment, including buildings, roads, highways and railroads, water and sewage systems, and energy facilities throughout Oregon (CLI 2008, 2010). Direct costs will result from flood events and anticipated increases in wildfire intensity and frequency due to climate change, while indirect costs are likely to be many times larger and will result from more rapid depreciation of property from higher temperatures, more intense storms and other climate stressors (CLI and NCCSP 2008). The full extent of impacts on cultural and built environments remains to be assessed in Oregon. Finally, climate change is likely to have an impact on public health issues in Oregon including the spread of communicable diseases as well as an increase in water-, food-, and air-borne infections. Predicted average increases in summer temperatures will make heat waves a greater likelihood, causing heat-related morbidity and mortality, especially among vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, low income populations, pregnant women and those who work in outdoor occupations. Indeed, an increase in injuries and cases of carbon monoxide poisoning (from using gas-powered generators) has been reported as a result of the recent winter storms and subsequent flooding in Oregon. Increasing temperatures in Oregon could raise the threat of vector-borne diseases and emerging infections. Respiratory insults, especially among persons with pre-existing lung health problems would be exacerbated by exposure to smoke from forest fires, as well as from the projected increases in air pollution levels in our region. Air pollution and increases in pollen counts (and a prolonged pollen producing season) may increase cases of allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions among susceptible populations. Additional research is needed to set baselines in order to monitor changes over time to understand more fully: (1) how a wide range of Oregonians who are likely to be affected by climate change due to the place they live, the job they hold, or the organization they work for, experience climate change impacts; (2) the acceptability of specific policy and behavioral changes to a wide range of Oregonians; and (3) the barriers faced by individuals, groups, and organizations, including state agencies, as they start to respond to the observed impacts of climate change in Oregon. While the studies reported in this chapter focus primarily on individual understanding and response to climate change, we have no current research regarding organizational or institutional capacity for carrying out any policy or operational changes required to adapt to a changing climate in Oregon. The Oregon Public Health Department has an ongoing tracking and monitoring program for most of the infectious and communicable diseases likely to be affected by climate change. The best means of fending off 398 any changes for the worse due to climate change are similar to those already in place: ensuring that changes in disease patterns can be can detected, investigating as needed, and mounting an appropriate public health response as soon as possible."
