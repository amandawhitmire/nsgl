9,Abstract:,Outdoor schools are located all over the nation. Many students attend these programs to gain science knowledge and experience nature first hand. Outdoor schools are residential programs for students in upper elementary and middle school. Many of the messages are environmental in nature and promote stewardship. The purpose of this study was to look at the impacts of attending an outdoor school on students as seen by the people who run and work at such sites.
