10,Abstract:,"FCMA (Fishery Conservation and Management Act) signaled a new departure in fishery governance. Among other things, it established fishery management councils to allow the unique cultural, economic, and biological character of regional fisheries to be reflected in management. However, although different regional approaches were used, management outcomes were similar: a failure to contain fishing capacity, limit fishing pressure, or control the array of problems that these conditions create. This paper introduces the papers in this issue that reflect on both the FCMA's past performance and its future prospects."
