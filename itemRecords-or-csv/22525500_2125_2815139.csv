9,Abstract:,"This study is a product of the Marine Affairs Institute at Roger Williams University School of Law and the Rhode Island Sea Grant Legal Program. Andrew Morin, Rhode Island Sea Grant Law Fellow, provided research and drafted this report under the guidance of Read Porter, senior staff attorney. All errors and omissions are the responsibility of the Marine Affairs Institute. This study is provided only for informational and educational purposes and is not legal advice. The coastal waters of southern New England are heavily used, especially during the summer months when fishers on small boats and large vessels seek to use the same waters. The intensive use of nearshore (also known as inshore) waters often results in conflicts among vessels and their gear. The small boats include recreational fishers and commercial rod and reel fishers who cannot run long distances or work through rough weather or 24-hour days like the larger commercial fleet, while larger vessels may use a variety of mobile gear, including midwater and bottom trawls and gillnets. This study identifies state limits on the use of area closures to manage coastal waters to avoid conflict. It focuses on gear restrictions in Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Rhode Island. Part One provides an overview of state nearshore restricted fishing areas. Part Two provides evidence and reasoning for why the government has an interest in regulating certain types of gear in nearshore areas. Part Three provides a general overview of the gear restriction models each state has in place. Part Four examines the seasonal restrictions applied to certain types of gear. Part Five details how states have physically demarcated the areas where gear restrictions have been implemented. Part Six lists some potential negative consequences to government implemented gear restrictions."
