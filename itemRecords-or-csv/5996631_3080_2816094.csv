12,Abstract:,"Chitosan-​Polyanion (Chi-Pol) complexes for treating aqueous food processing waste water were investigated using surimi waste water (SWW). Complexes of chitosan (CHI) with alginate (ALG), pectin (PEC) and carrageenan (CAR) were used at 50 and 150 mg complexlL SWW. At 150 mg/L and one hour, no significant differences were observed in the turbidity reductions by the three complexes which ranged 94�99%. Folin-Lowry analyses of the adsorbed complex revealed a 78�94% SWW protein adsorption onto these complexes. At 50 mg/L, a 92�97% turbidity reduction was observed with an 81�90% protein recovery but only after 24 h. Identical FTIR spectra of untreated SWW and protein adsorbed Chi-Alg complex confirmed protein adsorption on the complex."
