14,Abstract:,"Growth and movement of juvenile salmonids influence the expression of individual life history traits andproduction of adults at the population scale. We individually marked and recaptured juvenile Oncorhynchus mykissover the course of a year in Murderers Creek, a semi-arid tributary to the South Fork John Day River in NortheastOregon​. We tagged O. mykiss in three reaches with differing stream gradient, stream temperature and fish density.Mean growth rates differed significantly among reaches and seasons with a significant interaction between reachand season. Reaches with high growth rates shifted across Murderers Creek among seasons. Stream reaches withhigh growth during the winter had low growth during summer and vice-versa. The proportion of individualsmovi​ng at the reach scale during summer was low (≤2.6%), suggesting that individuals did not track resources atthe reach scale. The spatio-temporal variation in growth indicates that monitoring stream salmonids"
