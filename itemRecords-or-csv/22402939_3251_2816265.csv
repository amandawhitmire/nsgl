12,Abstract:,"In this report, researchers build off of the knowledge and relationships created from the Seacast web forecasting tool to explore the perceptions of uncertainty for both data providers and users. Researchers use the knowledge of these perceptions to derive metrics that address uncertainty which are acceptable to both parties. These metrics are then visualized using cartographic techniques related to visualization methods that fishermen are already familiar with."
