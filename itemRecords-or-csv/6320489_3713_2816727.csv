13,Abstract:,"Climate change has rapidly emerged as a significant threat to coastal areas around the world. While uncertainty regarding distribution, intensity, and timescale inhibits our ability to anticipate possible future impacts at the local and regional levels, it is widely accepted that changes in global climate will result in a variety of significant environmental, social, and economic impacts. Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and the implications of sea-level rise. The U.S. coastal zone is home to the majority of the U.S. population with coastal counties representing 53% of the nation's population and is also a major contributor to the national economy, representing approximately 40% of the nation's economic output. Given the economic, social and environmental significance of the U.S. coastal zone, there is consensus that coastal communities must develop their capacity to adapt to climate change in order to protect people, property, and the environment along our nation's coasts. The U.S. coastal zone is highly complex and variable, consisting of several regions that are characterized by unique geographic, economic, social and environmental factors. The degree of risk and vulnerability associated with climate change will vary greatly depending on the exposure and sensitivity of coastal resources within a given area. These factors have a direct influence on the ability of coastal communities to adapt to the anticipated impacts of global climate change. The ability of coastal communities to effectively adapt to climate change will depend greatly on their ability to develop and implement feasible strategies that address unique local and regional factors. A wide variety of resources are available to assist coastal states in developing their approach to climate change adaptation. However, given the complex and variable nature of the U.S. coastline, it is unlikely that a single set of guidelines can adequately address the full range of adaptation needs at the local and regional levels. Panel members will discuss the following issues as they pertain to their respective coastal regions: - Unique local and regional factors that characterize their coastal zone - Anticipated physical changes due to climate change - Anticipated social, economic and environmental impacts - Existing resources and guidelines for climate change adaptation - Current approach to climate change adaptation planning - Observed or anticipated challenges in developing adaptation strategies"
