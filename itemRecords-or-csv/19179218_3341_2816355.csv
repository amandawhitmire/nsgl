11,Abstract:,"Along the coast, Oregon Sea Grant has been helping residents prepare for a major earthquake and tsunami. One way it does this is by teaching people to create and use self-guided evacuation routes modeled after a treasure hunt. In these hunts, which are called quests, walkers follow a map and a series of educational clues about their surroundings to reach higher ground. At the end, they find a hidden box that contains a guest book and rubber stamp to mark their accomplishment. The aim is that by exploring these routes for fun in their free time, residents and visitors will later know where to flee in the event of a tsunami."
