10,Abstract:,"The author examines several new roles for the public trust doctrine in the management of coastal and ocean resouces. Section I concerns the public trust doctrine's relationship to the body of takings law derived from the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and related provisions in the state constitutions. These provisions provide that government shall not take private property for a public use without paying just compensation. Section II addresses public access rights to dry sand areas and encourages application of the public trust doctrine to decisions regarding coastal development and the prevention of erosion. Section III applies the public trust doctrine to state ocean waters and the exclusive economic zone, and Section IV addresses the role of the public trust doctrine in controlling nonpoint source pollution. Finally, the author recommends amending state coastal management programs to strengthen the applicability of the public trust doctrine for coastal decision making."
