9,Abstract:,"For years, the Oregon fishing industry has argued that the lack of coastal cold storage designed to handle seafood has severely limited the opportunity to develop value-added products and retain seafood industry employment. Once landed, the majority of Oregon seafood spends little time on the coast, and a large portion of that seafood is stored in facilities along the 1-5 corridor from Eugene to Bellingham. Many of these facilities are designed to hold agri- cultural and livestock products that do not have the same storage temperature requirements as seafood. Interest in coastal cold storage development has ranged from a relatively small walk-in cold store designed for a fishermen's cooperative; a relatively small cold storage warehouse serving a value-added processor; and a relatively large cold storage warehouse designed for a diverse set of products that may be managed by a port authority. This range of interest makes a single feasibility study inappropriate for the majority of interested parties. By using readily available software and collecting necessary cost data, a regionally-​based economic simulation model was developed to help interested parties explore the economic feasibility of various cold storage development scenarios. Further efforts integrated the model with research on frozen Pacific whiting surimi to provide a framework for designing cold stores for optimal temperatures. This model serves as an exploratory tool to support rural coastal communities in their economic development efforts by providing community leaders with analytical power and a cost-effective alternative to hiring outside analysts."
