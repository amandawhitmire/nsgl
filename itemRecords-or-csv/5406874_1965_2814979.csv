10,Abstract:,"Although students are not encouraged to enter the marine science profession in Chile, the number of institutions and researchers has increased in recent years as commercial fisheries have become more important in the Chilean economy. Great competition exists among research institutions and disciplines. Whereas much of this competition is due to a scarcity of research funds, it has also become institutionalizâ€‹ed and reduces the opportunity for obtaining funds from international organizations. Scientific data and research results are closely guarded. More than a quarter of the research results are published outside Chile; those published within Chile are directed primarily at research colleagues. Thus, very little information reaches people in the commercial sector who might gain some economic benefit from the investment in research."
