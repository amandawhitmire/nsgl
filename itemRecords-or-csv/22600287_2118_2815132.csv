12,Abstract:,"Commercial fishing in Oregon is a family enterprise, with women filling  crucial roles to help these businesses flourish. Often behind the scenes, whether at sea or on shore, most oral history interviews highlighted the  importance of these roles and how they continue to change along with markets, regulations, and the ocean itself. This video was created from oral histories gathered through research conducted as part of the Voices Oral History Archives. Produced by Oregon State Productions."
