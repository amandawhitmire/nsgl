12,Abstract:,"The growth of hatchery-reared ""Crassostrea gigas"" siblings and over-wintered spat was measured on commercial oyster grounds at three locations: Coos Bay, Oregon, and Willapa and Oyster bays, Washington. Sampling was carried out at four-month intervals at each location from November 1984 through June 1986. After two years on commercial grounds oysters showed similar growth measured by shell length and width although wet and dry weights of the meat varied considerably between locations. The spat, overwintered in a nursery, showed the lowest mortality on the commercial grounds, but did not show better meat yield than year younger oysters."
