12,Abstract:,"The commercial sportfishing industry, one segment of the marine boating community, is currently receiving increased attention from planners and managers nationwide.~ Since most existing studies deal with the industry by region, this report seeks to provide information on a national level. The report describes the number and geographical distribution of charterboats in the twenty-one coastal states of the United States (Great Lakes, Alaska, and Hawaii excluded), a general industry description, and operating characteristics​. Attitudes on and use of Loran within the charterboat industry are also detailed in this publication."
