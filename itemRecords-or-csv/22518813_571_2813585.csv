12,Abstract:,"The 2019 Oregon Marine Debris Action Plan summarizes the input and insights of the Oregon marine debris community. This group created the first plan for Oregon in 2017. This 2019 version discusses achievements and lessons learned since the first plan was published. It reviews and if needed modifies ongoing actions. The updated plan also identifies future actions on which to embark. The purpose of the Oregon Marine Debris Action Plan is to facilitate and track collaborative and effective actions that prevent and reduce marine debris in Oregon. This plan has four major goals: Prevention, Removal, Coordination, and Research."
