10,Abstract:,"Past experience has shown that port facilities can be susceptible to severe damage from earthquake ground shaking and associated phenomena and that such damage can result in significant economic losses to the post authority and to industries dependent on marine commerce. In recognition of this, the Ports and Harbors Committee of the ASCE-Technical Council for Lifeline Earthquake Engineering is developing seismic guidelines for hazard evaluation, design, analysis, and emergency response/recove​ry for port waterfront, cargo handling/storag​e, and infrastructure components. The objective of this reconnaissance following the Hyogo-Ken Nanbu Earthquake was to observe and evaluate the seismic performance of ports in the Osaka Bay region of Japan."
