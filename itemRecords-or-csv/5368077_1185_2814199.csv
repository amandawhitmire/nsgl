13,Abstract:,disease
14,,"The use of certification examinations to control the spread of infectious diseases of fish has revealed several previously unknown viruses. Examinations of adult chinook salmon returning to the Yaquina River in the fall of 1982 and to the Trask River in 1983 have resulted in the isolation of yet another one. Electron microscopy revealed enveloped particles 125-250 nm in diameter containing a coiled nucleocapsid. Electron micrographs showed the extracted nucleocapsid to be a helix 18 nm in diameter and up to 1000 nm in length. Based on morphology and biochemical features, the virus appears to be a member of the Paramyxoviridae​."
