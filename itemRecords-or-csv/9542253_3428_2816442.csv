13,Abstract:,"Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are among the most highly valued and widely available aquaculture species. They are also among the most critically endangered wild fishes in their native ranges. They are the subjects of numerous studies ranging from practical management and intensive aquaculture production to some of the most important investigations of behavior and genetics of any vertebrates. Those studies have provided a comprehensive background for testing critical hypotheses on life history and evolution at both proximate and ultimate levels. As a result we have detailed models for the effects of single genes on behavior and other aspects of the biology of salmon, including growth, sexual maturation and morphology. The complex life histories of salmon, with dramatic changes between freshwater and marine habitats, extensive migration behavior and extreme diversification of locally adapted populations continue to be productive subjects for studies of the relationships between genetics and behavior. Those studies of basic science are often guided by important questions from conservation and management, and in turn provide can yield the information that is needed by fishery managers responsible for decisions on these important species."
