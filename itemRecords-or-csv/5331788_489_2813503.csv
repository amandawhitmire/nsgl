10,Notes:,Report 1: The development of petroleum resources from the Outer Continental Shelf: Legal management problems and capabilities in Oregon.
11,Abstract:,"This report is intended to supply background information on (OCS) development to the Outer Continental Shelf Oil & Gas Development Task Force Final Report and serve as a resource for further research. The footnotes are intended to act as a resource as well as to document the text. Some other legal issues affecting OCS development are discussed elsewhere in this series of reports. For instance, the Coastal Zone ManagemenAct is discussed in a separate section. The major focus of this discussion will be the Outer Continental Lands Act, and its amendmmts of 1978, however, this paper does not purport to treat every aspect of the l978 Amendments (such as the oil pollution fund establishments)​, but is only an attempt to show how the Act and its amendments affect jurisdiction over the seabed and the management of resources therein. The paper is divided into three parts: the first section discusses the distribution of jurisdiction over the seabed, the second outlines the executive powers of the Interior Department of OCS administration and the third describes the management system as it operates today."
