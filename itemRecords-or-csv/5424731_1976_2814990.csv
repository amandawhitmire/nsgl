14,Abstract:,"The effects of rearing conditions on the physiological development of coho salmon, ""Oncorhynchus kisutch"", during smoltification were assessed. Combinations of various levels of both rearing density and water inflow rate were used. High rearing density resulted in reduced levels of plasma thyroid hormones in the fish; although both rearing density and water inflow rate affected plasma cortisol and gill Na, K-ATPase activity, their effects on these physiological variables seemed to vary through time. The relationships observed among experimental rearing conditions, water quality, and physiological status of the fish suggested that crowding stress itself may be an important factor by which high rearing density affects the physiology of coho salmon."
