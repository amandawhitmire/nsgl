11,Abstract:,"This report provides biochemical and behavioral evidence that in coho salmon certain olfactory properties of L-serine are mimicked by L-alanine and L-threonine. Although data from in-vitro receptor assays suggest that odor binding site TSA exists in coho salmon, results from behavioral cross-​adaptation and odor discrimination experiments show that the odor of threonine is unlike that of serine and alanine. We therefore propose that a functional olfactory receptor site, SA (serine-​alanine), exists in coho salmon."
