11,Abstract:,"In this paper, analytical solutions are used in conjunction with the source terms developed by McDougal and Liu (1986) to evaluate the random wave-induced pore pressure accumulation. since the solution is linear, three methods of examining random forcing are considered: superposition, Miner's method, and a single representative wave. A deep soil has a higher liquefaction potential than a shallow soil for the same wave conditions. Linear superposition. Miner's method and using the rms wave height are in general agreement for the deep soil; the significant wave overestimates the liquefaction potential and should not be used. There was poor agreement among the methods for a shallow soil."
