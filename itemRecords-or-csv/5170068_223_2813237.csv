13,Abstract:,"When industrializati​on occurs in a rural area, many aspects of the community may change. Such change affects various segments of the community differently. the controversy which often accompanies industrializati​on can be explained by the differential impact associated with the change. In this study some aspects of the economic portion of the overall impact are considered. A framework is provided through which the economic stress resulting from change can be traced and analyzed. The basic idea of the study is simple: a descriptive model of the community's economy is utilized to appraise economic change."
