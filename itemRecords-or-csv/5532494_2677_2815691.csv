13,Abstract:,"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) causes an acute, contagious disease in a number of economically important fish species. It is a member of the newly defined Birnaviridae virus family. These viruses are characterized by bisegmented double-stranded RNA genomes which encode four primary gene products. Recent reports have shown that a polyprotein containing NH3-​VP2-​NS-​VP3-​COOH is synthesized and that a proteolytic activity associated with the NS protein may be involved in the processing of this polyprotein to pVP2, NS, and VP3. It is shown here that the NS gene is required for proteolytic activity. However, unlike other known autocatalytic viral proteases, the activity associated with the NS gene was not inhibited with antisera to the NS protein and there was no demonstrable capacity for the NS protein to cleave a precursor polyprotein in ""trans."""
