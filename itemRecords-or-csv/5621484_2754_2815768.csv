11,Abstract:,"A description of the types of viral vaccines that are being developed for fish is presented in this review. All three types of vaccines, i.e. killed, attenuated, and subunit vaccines, have worked to some extent in fish under controlled laboratory conditions. However, with the exception of a killed vaccine for spring viremia of carp, there are no commercially available viral vaccines for fish. The introduction of these vaccines to aquaculture will require an understanding of immune recognition in fish and the development of cost-effective ways of producing a safe, immunogenic vaccine. A review of available information on vaccines for infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, spring viremia of carp virus, and channel catfish virus is presented. These are the main viruses that have been investigated for vaccine development; very little information is available on vaccines for other viral diseases of fish."
