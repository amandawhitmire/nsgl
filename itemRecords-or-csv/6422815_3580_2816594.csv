12,Abstract:,"High quality health management within the ornamental fish industry is based upon the concept of prevention. Prevention of disease is always cheaper than dealing with a disease outbreak once it has occurred. Disease prevention is also a key factor when developing a sustainable ornamental fish industry. Decreased or reduced disease leads to reduced wild collection to replace losses, decreased losses among broodstock and grow out fish lots, decreased financial output to treat or manage disease outbreaks, and improved overall quality of fish for the export or domestic market."
