11,Abstract:,"When waves reach the coast and break on a beach, they are observed to generate a variety of currents in the nearshore. Two principal current patterns can be distinguished that may be considered as end members or limiting cases within an otherwise continuum of flow-field types. The objective of this chapter is to review the mechanisms of nearshore- current generation. The focus will be primarily on two limiting cases because they contrast their basic modes of formation."
