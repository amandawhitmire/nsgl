14,Abstract:,"Oregon Sea Grant received a grant for 2007-09 from the NOAA Climate Program Office to conduct outreach and engagement activities with coastal decision-makers and communities to help them prepare for climate change. An essential component of this effort is understanding the opinions, attitudes, and information needs of the individuals we hoped to assist-​specifically, Oregon coast professionals who make decisions about development in the coastal zone. This study, conducted during 2008, evaluated their perceptions and opinions about climate change and climate change information; their motivation toward and barriers to undertaking climate change-related activity; the importance they attached to being able to respond to specific climate change effects; and what assistance, if any, they believed they needed in order to respond."
