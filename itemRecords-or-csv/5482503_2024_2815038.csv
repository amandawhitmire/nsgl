11,Abstract:,"In this paper, the potential for soil failure is examined in the vicinity of large fixed and floating surface-â€‹piercing structures. Two types of seabed failure are considered, liquefaction and scour. The analysis consists of several components. The first is the determination of the flow kinematics. The wave field near the structure is determined from linear theory using the boundary element method (BEM). The pressures and velocities determined from the BEM model along the bottom are the forcing for the seabed responses. The soil is modeled as a poro-elastic continuum using Biot consolidation theory. Liquefaction is estimated as a function of the cyclic shear stress ratio. The potential for scour is estimated with a simple incipient motion model."
