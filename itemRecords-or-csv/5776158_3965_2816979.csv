10,Abstract:,"Taken from a workshop, 'Groups that work,' held by members of the Oregon State University Fishing Families Project, this publication describes how to form or re-ignite groups, discusses how to identify and attract members to a group, and advises participants in how to focus on relevant activities. The resources offered are a checklist of things to consider before, during, and after the meeting; five dimensions of group development; specific techniques for coping with difficult people; and dealing with group dynamics."
