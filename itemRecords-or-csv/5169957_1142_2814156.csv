15,Abstract:,"This publication presents the results of an ambitious multi-​disciplinary study of a complex water quality problem. While the case study area has largely reached an equilibrium in its struggles with this social problem, it is hoped that this study of an actual situation will be helpful to those who are concerned with the more general case."
