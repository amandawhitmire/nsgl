14,Abstract:,"Regional Framework for Climate Adaptation builds on Oregon’s state-level Climate Change Adaptation Framework. It is based on an overview of downscaled climate projections specific to the region and expert presentations about the effects of projected changes on natural systems in Clatsop and Tillamook Counties. This regional framework is designed to help communities, land managers, and people in Clatsop and Tillamook Counties identify and revise policies, standards, criteria, and management practices that may underestimate risks to people, property, resources, and infrastructure from future climate conditions."
