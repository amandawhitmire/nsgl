13,Abstract:,"When first described, a gliding bacteria infection of fish was named columnaris disease. The disease caused by ""Flexibacter columnaris"" could be devastating to both juvenile and adult fish. Since that first description flexibacteria have been found to infect more than 36 species belonging to 10 families. There are poorly-defined aquatic flexibacteria which are phenotypically and biochemically indistinguishabâ€‹le from ""F. columnaris"". The purpose of this study was to use DNA hybridization techniques to distinguish a group of gliding bacteria from ""F. columnaris"" isolates. In addition, strains of ""F. columnaris"" which display different colony morphology are described."
