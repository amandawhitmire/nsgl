9,Abstract:,The Oregon State University Seafood Laboratory (now the OSU Coastal Oregon Marine Branch Experiment Station) conducted a study to fill the gap in knowledge about mercury content of local fish. Data from that study are presented here in table format. Mercury levels in most Oregon groundfish were found to be 'significantly lower than 0.50 pp.' Only spiny dogfish had mercury levels above 0.50 ppm.
