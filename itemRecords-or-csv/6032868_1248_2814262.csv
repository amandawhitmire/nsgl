9,Abstract:,"Classroom teachers often use live specimens ordered from biological supply houses to illustrate concepts in their science classes. However, live animals and plants used in school curricula can become nuisance species if they are released outside of the classroom. In many cases, educators may not even realize that they are using an invasive species in the classroom, and although some school districts have procedures for the proper disposal of nuisance animals and plants, students and teachers may have difficulty euthanizing or destroying them properly. This brochure discusses aquatic species and the damage they can do, explains how to get rid of them effectively, describes two popular classroom species?the rusty crayfish and Brazilian elodea? and provides contacts for further information."
