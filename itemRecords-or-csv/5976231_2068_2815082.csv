14,Abstract:,"In this paper, the authors describe the isolation and characterizatio​n of a myrcene synthase from cultured plantlets of the red alga ""Ochtodes secundiramea"". The conversion of the monoterpene precursor geranyl diphosphate to myrcene represents the first in vitro demonstration of a monoterpene synthase from any marine source and provides a basis with which to further explore the biosynthesis of halogenated monoterpenes."
