11,Abstract:,"Laboratory analysis of oil is an effective preventive maintenance tool. Why? Oil analysis helps determine the extent of wear and the presence of contaminants in the oil in a variety of systems, including diesel and gasoline engines, transmissions, hydraulic machinery, and compressors. This example should demonstrate the value of oil analysis."
