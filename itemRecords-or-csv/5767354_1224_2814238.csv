11,Abstract:,"Recent experience demonstrates that anchored sheet pile bulkheads are vulnerable to earthquake damage. This paper focuses on the results of an empirical and analytical investigation of the seismic performance of anchored sheet pile walls. The effectiveness of soil improvement in controlling permanent seismically-â€‹induced bulkhead deformations is evaluated as functions of bulkhead geometry, sheet pile stiffness, the density of backfill soils, and the characteristics of the strong ground motions. The results are presented in the form of a design chart for deformation- based analysis of existing anchored sheet pile walls, as well as simplified guidelines for determining the extent of ground treatment that is required given allowable deformation limits for the bulkhead."
