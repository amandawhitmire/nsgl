12,Abstract:,"The U.S. Pacific salmon industry is a major component of the country's seafood sector and is of considerable importance to various coastal communities in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. Every day, a wholesaler picks up the phone, goes to the telex or typewriter and engages in a wholesale transaction for salmon. How does the wholesaler decide how much to sell and at what price? Do the factors influencing these decisions change over time? What is the environment in which the manager operates; i.e., what risks and uncertainties, if any, does he or she face? These are among the issues addressed in this study of wholesale price determination in the Pacific salmon market."
