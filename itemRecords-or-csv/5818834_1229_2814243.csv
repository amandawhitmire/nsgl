9,Abstract:,"In this video six concerned Oregonians give their own views about why they're involved--in various ways--in helping restore salmon and their watersheds. They all talk candidly and personally, outside the labels of their backgrounds and roles. Their thoughtful comments affirm the deep connection that many people feel to salmon and our place with them."
