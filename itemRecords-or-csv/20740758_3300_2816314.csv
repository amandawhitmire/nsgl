8,Abstract:,"Just how dangerous are those flying carp? Students will learn about the invasive Asian carp and then apply their knowledge of principles of physics (Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions) to calculate the speed and potential impact of an Asian carp when it jumps from the water. If you were a passenger in the boat, would you want to duck?"
