9,Abstract:,"Halogenated monoterpene production by the red macroalga Ochtodes secundiramea was studied under different levels of nutrient, bromide, vanadium and light delivery. The key products formed were identified as myrcene, beta-elemene, the Z and E isomers of 10- bromomyrcene, 3-​chloro-​lOE-​bromomyrcene, Apakaochtodene A, and isomers of chloromyrcene and dibromomyrcene. The proposed pathway begins with an initial halogenation of myrcene to 3-chloromyrcene or 10-​bromomyrcene. 10-bromomyrcene reacts with either chloride or bromide ions producing either 3-​chloro-​10E-​bromomyrcene or 1,10- dibromomyrcene. The production of Apakaochtodene A starts from myrcene with 4 consecutive halogenation reactions, the first one forming the cyclic ring. All fermentations were carried out in similar 2L photobioreactor​s. Temperature was controlled at 26 deg C, with a photoperiod of 14 hours on: 10 hours off. Incident light intensity was 143 uE m^-2 s^-1 for nutrient, bromide and vanadium delivery cultivations and the mean light intensity was set to 52.5, 125, and 240 uE m^-2 s^-1 for light delivery cultivations. The pH was buffered to 8.0 with sodium bicarbonate, but not controlled. Air was supplied at 630 mL min^-1, wm of 0.3, and CO2 was supplied at 2 mL min1 for nutrient and light delivery cultivations and 0 mL min * for bromide and vanadium delivery cultivations. For nutrient delivery cultivations, nitrate was delivered at 0.006, 0.076 and 0.74 mmol Nitrate L^-1 day^1 and phosphate was delivered at 0.33, 3.99 and 38.4 (umol Phosphate L^-1 day^1. For semi-continuous delivery cultivations, bromide was delivered at 0.0, 0.0074, 0.013 and 0.13 mmol Bromide L^-1 day^1 at a constant vanadium delivery of 6.38 to 7.35 nmol Vanadium L^-1 day^1, and vanadium delivery was set to 0.0 and 6.38 nmol Vanadium L^-1 day^1 at a constant bromide delivery of 0.13 mmol Bromide L^-1 day^1. For fed-batch bromide and vanadium delivery cultivations the one time pulse of bromide raised the medium bromide concentration to 0.0, 0.038, 0.128 and 1.4 mmol Bromide L^-1, with the vanadium concentration going to 416 to 520 nmol Vanadium L^-1, and the pulse of vanadium raised the medium vanadium concentration to 0.0 and 515 nmol Vanadium L^-1, with the bromide concentration going to 1.1 to 1.4 mmol Bromide L^-1."
