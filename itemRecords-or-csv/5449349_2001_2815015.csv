13,Abstract:,"""Flexibacter columnaris"", formerly known as ""Chondrococcus columnaris"" or ""Cytophaga columnaris"", is the etiological agent of columnaris disease. It is a widely distributed pathogen of fish known to infect more than 36 species belonging to 10 families. There are six media commonly used for cultivation of ""F. columnaris"". Selection of an optimal medium capable of providing high cell yields with reproducible growth rates for large-scale production of vaccines was the objective of this research."
