11,Abstract:,"Recently water resource decisionmaking in the Pacific Northwest has taken one step toward centralization and one step away from it. Congress created a regional council with significant authority over hydropower and fish and wildlife uses of the Columbia River. Nearly simultaneously the regional, federal-state, water resource planning commission was disbanded by executive order. One might question which, if either, of these institutional changes represents an improvement. An investigation of whether there is some basis for believing that either more centralized or more decentralized organizational forms lead to superior river basin management concludes that a general rule can not be made. Particular organizational authorities alter what is efficient and what is not as well as who wins and who loses. As such the dilemma is political, not economic."
