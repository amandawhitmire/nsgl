14,Abstract:,"Fish ingestion is associated with lower mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD). However, in some Western populations whose diets are rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs), CHD mortality is consistently high despite high fish consumption. This study investigated the interaction of diets with a high and a low intake of saturated fatty acids with a fish-oil concentrate rich in n-3 fatty acids. In these four metabolically controlled diets, the endpoints of the study were the changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Results indicate that dietary SFAs and n-3 FAs have independent mechanisms of actions on the plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Optimal plasma lipids were produced by the diet low in SFA and high in n-3 FA."
