11,Abstract:,"Use this comprehensive species module for an in-depth understanding of colonial tunicates. Modules include a comprehensive species guide, a species-​at-​a-​glance fact sheet, a related lesson plan, suggested activies, comprehension questions, and videos and related on-line resources. What ancient animal in modern times has a primitave spinal cord that may resemble the first vertebrates on earth, spends most of its life stuck to a boat or rock, produces an exoskeleton made of cellulose and is more associated with plants than animals? Tunicates are marine invertebrate filter feeders that colonize underwater substrates and can also be invasive. They can be spread by boats, fishing gear and aquaculture activities."
