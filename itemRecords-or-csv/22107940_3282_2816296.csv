16,Abstract:,"Laboratory investigations of physiological processes in phytoplankton require precise control of experimental conditions. Chemostats customized to control andmaintain stable pHlevels (pHstats) are ideally suited for investigations ​ of the effects of pH on phytoplankton physiology, for example in context of ocean acidification. Herewe designed and constructed a simple, flexible pHstat system and demonstrated its operational capabilities under laboratory culture conditions. In particular, the systemis useful for simulating natural cyclic pH variabilitywith​in aquatic ecosystems, such as diel fluctuations that result from metabolic activity or tidal mixing in estuaries. The pHstat system operates in twomodes: (1) static/set point pH, whichmaintains pH at a constant level, or (2) dynamic pH,which generates regular, sinusoidal pHfluctuations by systematically varying pHaccording to user-​defined parameters. The pHstat is self-regulating through the use of interchangeable electronically controlled reagent or gas-mediated pH-modification manifolds, both of which feature flow regulation by solenoid valves. Although effective pH control was achieved using both liquid reagent additions and gas-mediated methods, the liquid manifold exhibited tighter control (±0.03 pH units) of the desired pH than the gas manifold (±0.10 pH units). The precise control provided by this pHstat system, aswell as its operational flexibilitywill facilitate studies that examine responses by marine microbiota to fluctuations in pH in aquatic ecosystems."
