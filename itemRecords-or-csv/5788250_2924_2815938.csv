12,Abstract:,"Edible coatings prepared using proteins and polysaccharides can help retain high preservative concentrations on food surfaces to retard microbial surface growth which limits the shelf life of many products. Coating effectiveness is affected by coating formulation, food water activity, food pH and storage temperature. Chitosan, the deacetylated derivative of chitin, is another versatile molecule with potential applications in diverse fields, including waste water treatments. Chitosan can also form polymeric complexes. Suspended proteins found in waste effluents, fermentation media and other industrial streams can be recovered as chitosan-​protein or chitosan-​polyanion-​protein complexes."
