12,Abstract:,"The diseases of most concern to salmonid culturists are those for which there is no known therapy, among them those caused by viruses. Many of these infectious agents are not distributed worldwide but are endemic in certain geographic regions. Salmonid stocks have been extensively transplanted to new locations for many years, and in certain instances their pathogens and parasites have been transported along with them. Three management policies should be implemented to minimize risk: (1) the disease history of the stock of fish to be transplanted should be determined before movement; (2) only eggs from parents which have been tested and found free of disease should be transported; and (3) disinfected eggs should be hatched and reared in quarantine until the juveniles can be certified free of disease."
