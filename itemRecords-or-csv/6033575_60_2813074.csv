12,Abstract:,"The United States consumes more electricity than any other country in the world. More than half of that energy is produced from nonrenewable fossil fuels. A widely available, renewable, and clean source for electricity would be a great environmental and economic asset. Supported in part by Oregon Sea Grant, some engineering faculty and students at Oregon State University have been working to develop the concepts and tests for the emerging technology of wave energy. This 12 minute color DVD captures the enthusiasm gathering around this initiative."
