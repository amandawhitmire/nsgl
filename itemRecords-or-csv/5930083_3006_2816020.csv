11,Abstract:,"The status of proteolytic enzymes and other sarcoplasmic proteins (hemoglobin and myoglobin) clearly differs between conventional and acid-aided surimi processing. In the conventional process they are removed, but in the acid-aided process they are retained along with the myofibrillar proteins. The overall objective of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of the new acid-aided approach in enzyme- rich Pacific whiting and to compare it to the conventional method. Additional objectives were to characterize the proteolytic enzymes and to determine the physicochemical properties of Pacific whiting surimi prepared by the two processes."
