13,Abstract:,"The paper presents an overview and rationale for a new hydraulic model for tsunami inundation over and around macro-roughness to observe the effect of building shape and density on tsunami inundation and to develop a new data set for the evaluation numerical models for complex flows. This fixed-bed experiment focuses on the initial inundation zone along the water front such that the flow among several individual buildings can be observed. The model, constructed at 1:50 scale, was an idealization of the town of Seaside, Oregon, and retained several of the characteristic features, including a 2 m high (prototype) seawall, large hotels along the water front, and smaller commercial and residential structures. This paper introduces a new application of the Argus observation system to quantify the bore front as the tsunami propagates through the constructed environment. Qualitative comparisons are made to two numerical models developed for complex free surface flows. Both models are able to reproduce the characteristics of the inundation observed in the physical model."
