11,Abstract:,"This project focuses on the thermal conductivity, k, of surimi, an intermediate frozen raw material made of minced and washed fish meat with a range of cryoprotectant concentrations. Sucrose and sorbitol are commonly used as cryoprotectants to stabilize surimi's quality during freezing and frozen storage. Research objectives were (1) to develop an appropriate k measurement system for frozen foods and to investigate the effects of various experimental conditions; (2) to examine the effects of sample history on measured k values and to measure the thermal conductivity of surimi having different levels of cryoprotectant; and (3) to select the most accurate model for future prediction."
