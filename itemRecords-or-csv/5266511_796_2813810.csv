11,Abstract:,"The overall goal of this study was to assess the impact of potential and actual changes in institutions and policy on energy consumed by transport modes in the shipment of Pacific Northwest (PNW) wheat. In order to achieve this goal, sequential objectives were: (1) to model total energy requirements by incorporating energy coefficients into a minimum cost volume allocation model of transporting PNW wheat; (2) to identify energy consumption with respect to the alternative minimum cost models under various policy changes and compare with shipper transport costs."
