13,Abstract:,"A new patented process for surimi processing using acid solubilization and recovery can provide extremely high yields (35-45 percent). The process consists of isolating the protein component of fish muscle tissue by acid and separating by centrifugation. The new method results in commercially acceptable gel characteristicsâ€‹, and compared to the conventional method of surimi manufacturing, significantly reduces water consumption and waste. In addition, sarcoplasmic proteins (hemoglobulin, myoglobulin, and proteolytic enzymes) and other proteinous materials are not removed. As fish proteins treated at extremely low and high pH applications are likely to be denatured, this study focused on characterizing the biochemical and physical properties of fish proteins and compared them to the conventional process."
