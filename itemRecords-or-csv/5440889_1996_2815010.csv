12,Abstract:,"The tropical red marine alga ""Murrayella periclados"" is a rich source of the physiologically-​potent icosanoid 12-(S)-HEPE, previously only reported from animal tissues and cells. Comparison of our data with that for a reported hydroxyicosapen​taenoic acid from the related seaweed ""Laurencia hybrida"" leads us to reassign the latter structure to 12-HEPE. Because 12-(S)-HEPE was hypothesized as a likely intermediate in the biosynthesis of hybridalactone, an unusual marine prostanoid from ""L. hybrida"", its isolation from this and related seaweeds provides additional support of a lipoxygenase pathway to prostanoids in marine organisms."
