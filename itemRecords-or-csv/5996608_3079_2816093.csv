12,Abstract:,"Electron penetration and microbial inactivation by electron beam (e-beam) in surimi seafood were investigated. Dose map revealed that 1- and 2-sided e-beam could efficiently penetrate 33- and 82-mm thick surimi seafood, respectively. Modeling of microbial inactivation by e-beam demonstrated that 2-sided e-beam may control ""Staphylococcus aureus"" if the surimi seafood package is thinner than 82 mm. The D(e- beam) value for ""S. aureus"" was 0.34 kGy. An e-beam dose of 4 kGy resulted in a minimum of a 7-log and most likely a 12-log reduction of ""S. aureus"". Microbial inactivation was slower when frozen samples were subjected to e-beam."
