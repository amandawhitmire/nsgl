12,Abstract:,"This article discusses how research focused on family learning in and from museums has progressed over the past decade and shares some perspectives from the field regarding its usefulness for practice. Although families were clearly a dominant audience in museums, there were not significant numbers of researchers focusing on family learning until the mid to late 1970s. By the late 1980s, there was an extensive body of literature that established the importance of family learning in and from museums. These early studies demonstrated the significance of families as a focus of museum research, identifying them as a major audience and unique learning group of mixed ages and backgrounds, bound together by a complex, shared system of past experiences, beliefs, and values. They also established the complex nature of family interactions, highlighting the ways in which family members interact and learn together, and providing evidence that families bring an extensive array of personal and cooperative learning strategies to their experience in museums."
