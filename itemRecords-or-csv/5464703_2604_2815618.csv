21,Abstract:,"At present, the control of viral diseases in aquaculture-​raised fish is based largely on management. In the U.S., there are no commercially available viral vaccines for salmonid fish. Vaccines that may be considered for development in the aquaculture industry are killed, live-​attenuated, and subunit vaccines. Killed vaccines are the easiest to develop, test and license; but the cost per dose is very high. The fact that the virus in live-attenuated viral vaccines replicates makes safety testing an important consideration. A subunit recombinant DNA vaccine would be relatively inexpensive, and safety would be assured. The key problem in the development of this type of vaccine has been maintaining the proper antigenicity of the cloned viral protein. Progress to date is described."
