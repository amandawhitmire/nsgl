12,Abstract:,"Manufacturing fish sauce from whole Pacific whiting (W) and a mixture (50/50) (WB) of surimi byproducts and whole fish was investigated to develop histamine-free fish sauce and to better utilize solid byproducts. This study also discusses the marketing potential and biochemical properties of the respective fish sauces. Marketing potential for Pacific whiting fish sauce in the United States was evaluated through phone interview and consumer panels. Fish sauce import reached $16.6 million in the United States in 2000. Anchovy was the most popular raw material used (47%) in the fish sauce process and brand name was the most important factor in the purchase decision (52%). Consumer tests disclosed no significant difference in flavor acceptance and overall acceptance among fish sauce W, fish sauce WB, and commercial anchovy fish sauce (P> 0.05). As fermentation time increased, the degree of hydrolysis increased and higher total nitrogen and total amino acid contents were obtained; however, moisture content and pH decreased. Glutamic acid, alanine, leucine, lysine, and arginine were abundant after 9 months fermentation and accounted for 43.27% and 54.08% of total amino acids in fish sauce W and WB, respectively. Fish sauce W had a total amino acid concentration of 38.4 mg per ml, which was twice as much as WB fish sauce (16.6 mg per ml). Based on positive consumer acceptance, good quality, and low cost, it was concluded that fish sauce from Pacific whiting had potential to replace imported anchovy fish sauce (which contains histamine)."
