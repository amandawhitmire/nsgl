17,Notes:,This curriculum has been developed by the Oregon Sea Grant Program through participation in the Pacific Circle Consortium's Ocean Project.
18,Abstract:,"The goal of the Pacific Circle Consortium's Ocean Project is to help students gain an understanding of their Pacific neighbors and increase their awareness of the interdependence of Pacific nations through trade. Each member nation produced a home study unit on a harbor in its country. Participants are Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the U.S. The University of Hawaii coordinated the project and developed a unit on Honolulu. Each member studies both his own and one other harbor. The Oregon Sea Grant Program developed this teachers' resource book on the Columbia River; the exchange unit is on Hiroshima, Japan. The unit is designed for grades 5-7; a handbook describing all home units is in preparation."
