11,Abstract:,"Until now, no available publication has integrated fundamental oceanographic concepts with basic research from the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Oregon. Researchers have written hundreds of scientific papers, but, to most, such papers are neither readily accessible nor easily understood. Likewise, a number of good introductory textbooks on marine science are available, but they lack specific information for the Oregon region. The ""Oceanbook"", with an atlas-like format, brings together basic oceanography and research data to describe and characterize Oregon's ocean for the interested public. Separate chapters, extensively illustrated and referenced, cover the ocean's ecology and life forms, marine ecology, geology and hydrography, oceanography, plankton, nekton, benthos and marine birds and mammals."
