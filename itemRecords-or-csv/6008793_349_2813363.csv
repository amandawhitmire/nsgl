13,Abstract:,"The Dungeness crab and the red rock crab are prominent in Northwest bay and coastal waters. As the name implies, red rock crabs are dark red on top. Dungeness crabs are reddish tan to gray purple above. Both are highly regarded for their sport and table values. Recreational seasons are open all year in Oregon bays, and about the only time crabs aren't available is when extreme freshets reduce water salinity, forcing crabs oceanward to saltier water."
