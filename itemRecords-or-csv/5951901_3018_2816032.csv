11,Abstract:,"Grenadaliene (1), debromogrenadie​nce (2), and grenadamide (3), three structurally unique cyclopropyl-​containing metabolites, were isolated from the organic extract of a Grenada collection of the marine cyanobacterium ""Lyngbya majuscula."" The structures and the relative stereochemistri​es of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic methods. These are the first reported cyclopropyl-​containing fatty acid derivatives from a ""Lyngbya"" sp. Grenadaliene (1) has an interesting profile of cytotoxicity in the NCI 60 cell line assay, while grenadamide (2) exhibited modest brine shrimp toxicity (LD50=5 mu g/mL)and cannabinoid receptor binding activity (Ki = 4.7 mu M)."
