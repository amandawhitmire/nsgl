13,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus that typically infects and causes death in all fish species belonging to the genus ""Oncorhynchus""; ""Salmo"" spp. are less affected, and ""Salvelinus"" spp. are thought to be resistant. However, the susceptibility of brook trout ""Salvelinus fontinalis"" to IHNV infection and disease has not yet been resolved and is controversial. This study has shown that brook trout become diseased and die after exposure to a high dose of one type 1 IHNV isolate and can be infected after immersion exposure to even a low dose of type 1 or type 2 IHNV."
