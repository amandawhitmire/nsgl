12,Abstract:,"The A Segment of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) encodes three primary gene products beta1 (b1), gamma 1(y1) and gamma 2(y2), in one open reading frame. The gene order is 5'B-y2-y13'. The production and processing of the b1, y2 and y1 polypeptides were studied by both in vitro translation and bacterial expression of the A segment coding region with various deletions. Virus-specific polypeptides were identified with antisera which were specific for groups of the viral proteins. The bacterial expression of these proteins for use as a subunit vaccine is also described. In both the bacterial expression and in vitro translation systems, truncated polyproteins were produced that provided evidence of a polyprotein precursor in the production of the b1, y1 and y2 proteins. Since the truncated polyproteins were produced when deletions were made to the y2 gene, the y2 protein was implicated as a virus-specific protease responsible for the polyprotein processing. The putative protease activity of the y2 protein was not found to act in trans and specific antisera to it did not inhibit its activity in in vitro translation reactions. In the in vitro translation system, internal initiations of translation were demonstrated for the y2 and y1 proteins. Therefore, internal initiations of translation may be an alternative mechanism for the production of these proteins. The A Segment products were expressed in bacteria as a fusion with the TrpE gene and used in a preliminary trial as an immersion vaccine for rainbow trout fry. The vaccination resulted in substantial protection from subsequent viral challenge."
