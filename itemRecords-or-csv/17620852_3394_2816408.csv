9,Abstract:,"The Curriculum Merit Checklist (CMC) is a tool to help educators evaluate curriculum. The purpose of the CMC is to evaluate the merit of a lesson or set of lessons. The merit of a lesson is the projected value of the written lesson, prior to having taught it. The CMC was created to be used as part of a curriculum evaluation or as a guideline for including best practices during curriculum development. It is intended for informal educators evaluating or developing curriculum; however, it can be useful at any point in the process, and can be applied to curriculum from the lesson level to the unit level. It can also be used with curriculum developed for K-12 classrooms."
