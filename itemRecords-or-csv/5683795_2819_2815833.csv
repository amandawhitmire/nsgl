12,Abstract:,"During the 103d Congress, whose term ended in 1994, three important pieces of U.S. ocean legislation were scheduled for reauthorization​: the Magnuson Fisher Conservation and Management Act (MFCMA), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Missing from the original acts was the recognition that natural resources, including those in the ocean, cannot be sufficiently protected or successfully managed in isolation from one another. Each law was passed with scant notice of the impact it would have on the others. The issues discussed in this paper involve concrete attempts to work out conflicting uses of ocean space and resources between human interests, through such techniques as buffer zones, to avoid losing biological diversity. The paper explains the complex network of incidental-take provisions of the MMPA, ESA and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) and shows where and how they interact. It reviews and critiques the National Marine Fisheries Service and MMPA Negotiating Group's proposals for amending the incidental-take provisions and describes current real-world interactions. The authors conclude that a more holistic approach to protection and management of marine resources is needed but unlikely to be successfully implemented for an umber of reasons: the mobility of the marine species of concern, the fluid nature of their environment, the mixed track record of the federal agencies charged with their protection and management, and congressional inability to legislate in other than a piecemeal fashion."
