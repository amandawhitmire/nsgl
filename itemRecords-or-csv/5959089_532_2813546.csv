12,Abstract:,"Geologically speaking, Oregon coast fossils are found in three formations: The Astoria Formation, 15- to 20-million- year-old sandstone layers mixed with compressed volcanic ash; Nye mudstone, up to 20 million years old; and on south coast stretches of beach, Coledo Formation specimens of dark ash and sand, which are 25-30 million years old. These formations of compacted sand, volcanic ash, and river-borne silt are uplifted from the Pacific Ocean floor by geo-plate movement. This fact sheet for fossil gatherers and curious beachgoers describes many types of bivalve, gastropod, wood, and bone fossils, and how they may have formed."
