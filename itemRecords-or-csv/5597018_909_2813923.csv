11,Abstract:,"Traditional methods of smoked food preservation typically produced high salt and low moisture content products that were not desirable to most modern consumers. Commercial processors have adjusted processing conditions to produce the lower salt and moister products that will sell in today's markets. One result of these changes is that processing conditions must be standardized, controlled, monitored, and documented so the potential for producing toxic, or even lethal, food products is eliminated. This is especially true for seafood products which may contain food poisoning organisms of marine origin that are more difficult to control than those from land sources, especially ""Clostridium botulinum"" Type E. This pamphlet covers hot and cold fish smoking procedures in smokehouses using horizontal flow forced-air convection."
