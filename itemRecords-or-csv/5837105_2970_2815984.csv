11,Abstract:,"Chitosan-​Polyanion (Chi-Pol) complexes could constitute a cheaper flocculation alternative to chitosan alone in Cheddar cheese manufacture. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the efficiency of Chi-Pol for the recovery of suspended solids in cheddar cheese whey as affected by the polyanion used, Chi-Pol monomeric mixing ratio, Chi-Pol concentration in whey, treatment time, and agitation effect and (2) to investigate coagulation by UV- vis spectrophotomet​ry and proximate analysis of coagulated solids."
