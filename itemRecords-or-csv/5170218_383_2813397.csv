12,Abstract:,"A one-​dimensional, implicit, finite-​difference model is developed, calibrated and verified for three estuaries along the central Oregon coast. The model is used to generate controlled data for a large number of hypothetical estuaries. Two non-dimensional coefficients, KF and. KI are developed incorporating physical characteristics of the estuary which summarize the effects due to friction and inertia, respectively. These coefficients are used to explain the variability of tidal response throughout the complete range of hypothetical estuaries investigated. A predictive algorithm based on the derived relationships is presented and examples of its application to real estuaries is given. The results of this study can. be used to predict modifications in tidal response due to proposed physical changes in an estuary, such as entrance dredging or filling of tidal flats. Field data of velocity, temperature and salinity for the Yaquina, Alsea and Siletz estuaries is included with the paper."
