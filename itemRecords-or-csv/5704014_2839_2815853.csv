11,Abstract:,"The photolithotroph​ic cultivation of a novel cell suspension culture derived from the microscopic, filamentous gametophyte life phase of the complex brown alga ""Laminaria saccharina"" was feasible in an illuminated bubble-column bioreactor using carbon dioxide in air as the sole carbon source for growth. Maximum cell densities and growth rates were attained within a 20-day cultivation period. Initial cell density had a significant effect on the final biomass density of the clumped cell suspension, but no significant effect on the specific growth rate. The culture was not carbon dioxide limited. Initial nitrate concentrations had no significant effect on the specific growth rate or final biomass density, but both were correlated to incident light intensity."
