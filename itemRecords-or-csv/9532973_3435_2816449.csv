10,Abstract:,"This brief video provides an overview of the StreamWebs program and gives viewers a better understanding for how StreamWebs resources, such as the online database, sampling protocols and equipment, and curricular material, support teachers and project coordinators in their efforts to do field based projects with students. Students taking part in the Coos Watershed Associations “Watershed Stewards” class, which uses the StreamWebs platform, offer their thoughts on the importance of field programs."
