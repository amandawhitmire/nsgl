8,Abstract:,"How do beaches recover after storms? Until very recently, natural beach recovery was poorly understood. Tuba Ozkan-Haller and Merrick Haller bring their own beach to the Hinsdale Wave Research Lab at Oregon State University to learn more about this process. Equipped with an arsenal of state-​of-​the-​art electronic sensors, remote cameras, and 1000 yards of sand, they hope to develop new tools that can help predict how beaches will recover."
