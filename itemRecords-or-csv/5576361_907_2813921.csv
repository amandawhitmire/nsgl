15,Abstract:,"1990 brought major changes to the area of fisheries law. The source of these changes was Congress. Congress reauthorized and amended the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act( MFCMA) by passing the Fishery Conservation Amendments( Fishery Amendments). The scope of these amendments, together with the passage of time since the last revised edition of this guidebook, dictate that we undertake the production of an entirely new edition."
