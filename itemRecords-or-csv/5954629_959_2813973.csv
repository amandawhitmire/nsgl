13,Abstract:,"In lowland areas where dikes or landfill have altered streams, marshes, and adjacent estuaries, managers often employ tide gates to further regulate the flow of water. Tide gates generally prevent tidal waters from moving upstream while allowing freshwater to flow through a culvert into the receiving body of water. This publication provides an interesting overview of tide gates and the extensive physical, chemical, and biological effects they exert on the regional environment. These effects include changes in size, shape, temperature, salinity, and chemistry of the waters, and the consequent alterations in plant and animal populations."
