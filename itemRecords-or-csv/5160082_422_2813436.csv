10,Abstract:,Preliminary investigation by the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife indicates that a long-line crab pot retrieval system has definite advantages over the individual pot retrieval method currently in use on the Oregon coast. The comparative study is part of a research project established to determine the relative merits of the two retrieval systems.
