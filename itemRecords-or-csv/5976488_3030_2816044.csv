13,Abstract:,"Researchers monitored starvation resistance and growth in larvae from 20 female black rockfish ""Sebastes melanops"", ranging in age from 5 to 17 years. Larvae from the oldest females had growth rates more than three times as fast and survived starvation more than twice as long as larvae from the youngest females. Female age was a far better predictor of larval performance than female size. The apparent underlying mechanism is a greater provisioning of larvae with energy-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids as female age increases. The volume of the oil globule (composed primarily of TAG) present in larvae at parturition increases with maternal age and is correlated with subsequent growth and survival. Age truncation commonly induced by fisheries may, therefore, have severe consequences for long-term sustainability of fish populations."
