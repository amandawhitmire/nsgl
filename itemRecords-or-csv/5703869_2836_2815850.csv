13,Abstract:,"An activity staining method using SDS-substrate gel was used to determine Pacific whiting proteolytic activity. The most active protease band corresponds to the activity of cathepsin L. The activity was more pronounced for ocean- caught than Puget Sound whiting, or ocean-caught arrow-tooth flounder. Gel electrophoresis activity staining of proteolytic enzymes in Pacific whiting was not as sensitive as the TCA-azocasein assay but provided information on the molecular properties of the enzyme and a semi-​quantitative estimation of activity."
