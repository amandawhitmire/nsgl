10,Abstract:,"This document summarizes Oregon Sea Grant’s mission and the values that create its vision. It also outlines the program’s goals and subgoals. Our intention is that our functional planning will provide guidance for improving the program’s performance and will allow the program to be both deliberate and responsive, changing with fluctuating needs and circumstances while retaining the best of what works. In addition, this document outlines the processes we use to identify priority issues or themes, and it briefly describes the program’s most current thematic goals. In other words, this plan describes both how we intend to do business and what issues, problems, and opportunities will receive most of our attention in the period 1998–2003. In its more than 30 years of existence, Oregon Sea Grant has built highly visible and productive research and outreach programs."
