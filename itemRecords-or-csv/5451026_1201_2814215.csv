11,Abstract:,"In this paper, the Late Holocene zoogeographic history of marine mammal taxa (sea otters and 5 spp. of seals) along the Oregon coast is outlined as indicated by faunal remains recovered from three archaeological sites on that coast. The information provided by those remains is suggestive of the nature of effects on selected marine mammal taxa resulting from commercial exploitation."
