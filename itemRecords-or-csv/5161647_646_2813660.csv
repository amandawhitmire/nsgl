10,Abstract:,"The term ocean ranching has been used to describe a number of production concepts employing varying degrees of culture intensity, For example, the artificial propagation of salmon to augment offshore fisheries is considered to be a form of extensive aquaculture even though it may be intensive in the early stages. In the subsequent sections of this report the term ocean ranching will be used in a restricted sense to describe a specific production concept. This concept involves the production of chum salmon fry in an incubation system designed specifically for this purpose, the direct release of these unfed fry and the harvesting of mature fish upon their return to the natal facility. This is among the least intensive approaches to fish production with respect to capital, labor and operating expenses. As such, it is a promising approach to large scale production of Iow cost aquatic animal protein."
