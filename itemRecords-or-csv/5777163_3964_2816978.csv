10,Abstract:,"Based on analysis of scaling relationships, a modified nonlinear cross-shore sediment transport model (CROSS) is proposed in this study. Three sets of large wave tank data are utilized, including three cases in the large German wave flume in Hannover, and one case in the SUPERTANK experiments at Oregon State University to calibrate and compare the proposed nonlinear equation with the linear. The proposed CROSS model is compared with three existing models (EDUNE, SBEACH AND CCCL) by beach erosion predictions at Ocean City, Maryland during the November 1991 and January 1992 storms. Of these models, only SBEACH (both versions) and EDUNE include representation of dune overwash."
