13,Abstract:,"Kinetic energy is the type of energy that exists within motion. Waves are in constant motion and therefore possess a consistent form of energy. Wave energy devices are being developed to harness that energy and convert it to electricity. This article, intended for 4th- through 12th-grade teachers, describes how to make a simple, working model of a wave energy device and a water tank in which to test it, and includes explanations of the theories behind wave energy and electromagnetisâ€‹m."
