13,Abstract:,"As the focus of management shifts from a single to a multispecies perspective, the range of potential objectives increases, and different objectives are more likely to result in disparate system states and yields. Moreover, whereas preservation of yield capacity and maximization of yield are largely compatible for single species management, adopting a multispecies perspective increases the chance that such objectives will conflict. There are significant constraints on the ability to achieve objectives for multispecies fisheries, not least the fact that a common objective for multispecies fisheries (maximized yield of each species) is unattainable for systems containing interactions among species. The adoption of firm objectives for fisheries that contain biological or technological interactions presumes levels of knowledge or control that are unlikely to be obtainable or desirable; therefore, it is suggested that a more feasible approach to defining objectives is to seek satisfactory and progressively improved management solutions."
