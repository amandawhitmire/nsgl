10,Abstract:,"Use the comprehensive species module here for an in-depth understanding of the New Zealand mudsnail. Modules include a comprehensive species guide, a species-​at-​a-​glance fact sheet, a related lesson plan, suggested activies, comprehension questions, and videos and related on-line resources. New Zealand mudsnails are a highly invasive species of freshwater mollusk of the family Hydrobiidae, also known as spring snails. Their ability to clone themselves and maintain high reproductive rates allows them to rapidly spread throughout the western United States. Some estimates indicate that one female can clone and produce over 312,500,000 offspring in one year."
