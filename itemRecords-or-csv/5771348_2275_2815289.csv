11,Abstract:,"Commercial fishing families are used to change, and many even enjoy it. Husbands enjoy their connection to the sea and the sense of self-​sufficiency that comes with fishing; wives enjoy the accomplishment and independence of and working for pay on land. But change can also pose challenges as families adapt to the cycles of departure, separation, homecoming, and reunion. Drawing on the experiences of Oregon fishing families, the authors explore those cycles and suggest strategies for coping with them. This research is part of a larger Oregon Sea Grant project entitled ""Adapting to Change: Fishing Families, Businesses, Communities, and Regions."""
