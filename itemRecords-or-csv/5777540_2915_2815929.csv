10,Abstract:,"Marine fisheries face common problems of overcapitalizatâ€‹ion, stock depletion, declining yields, and increasing conflict. Fisheries are publicly owned resources affected by the behavior of diverse groups acting within nested institutional structures. Current fishery governance is not promoting sustainability. The scope of governance is discussed in the context of a long-term planning focus and it's structure in terms of its ability to accommodate the behavioral incentives of fishery users. This paper identifies changes needed to strengthen ocean governance and assesses the major challenges to making effective change."
