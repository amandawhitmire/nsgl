12,Abstract:,"This article examines whale watchers' environmental value orientations, experience in relation to whales and the marine environment, and awareness of consequences of their behavior on whales and their habitat. Data were obtained from surveys of 229 shore-based whale watchers in Oregon (USA). Respondents believed that whales and marine areas are important and require protection, and their daily actions affect them and their habitat. Many respondents visited the ocean and watched programs about whales and marine ecosystems; few volunteered or donated to related causes. Structural equation models showed that experienced viewers had stronger biocentric value orientations and were more aware of consequences of their behavior. Value orientations mediated effects of experience on awareness of consequences."
