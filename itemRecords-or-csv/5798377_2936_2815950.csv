12,Abstract:,"Myxosporeans (Myxozoa: Myxosporea) constitute a major group of fish parasites. For a number of freshwater species, it has been demonstrated that myxozoans undergo 2 developmental cycles, one of them (myxosporean) in the fish and the other (actinosporean) in an aquatic oligochaete or polychaete worm. Each cycle terminates in a spore stage, which is infective for the other host. However, the routes of infection, life cycle and pathogenesis are still unknown for the vast majority of species, making their control very difficult. Specific and sensitive diagnostic tools for myxozoans are thus highly desirable, and those based on conserved attributes of the parasites during this complex life cycle are currently the best choice. Infection with ""Ceratomyxa shasta"" has been recognized as a serious impediment to salmonid aquaculture in the Pacific Northwest. This work describes the design and use of a diagnostic PCR assay for ""C. shasta""."
