13,Abstract:,"The potent mammalian immunohormone, 12-​(S)-​hydroxy-​5,8,10,14-​icosatetraenoic acid (12-(S)-HETE), is a 12-lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid that is widely distributed in animal tissues, but has never been found in plants. As part of an extensive survey of the biomedicinal potential of Caribbean marine algae, the crude lipid extracts of more that 100 species of seaweeds were examined for a combination of antimicrobial properties and unique compounds. One of the algae screened in this effort, ""Platysiphonia miniata"" (Delesseriacea, Rhodophyta), exhibited antimicrobial activity against two gram positive microorganisms, ""Staphylococcus aureus"" and ""Bacillus subtilis"", and showed the presence of several potentially unique secondary metabolites. Subsequent work on this alga yielded the first isolation of the 12-lipoxygenase product, 12-(S)-HETE, from a plant."
