14,Abstract:,"Researchers examined the effect of rhabdovirus matrix protein expression on fish cells for a fish rhabdovirus, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). The six genes of IHNV are N, the nucleo-capsid protein; P, the phosphoprotein; M, the matrix protein; G, the glycoprotein; NV, the nonvirion protein; and L, the polymerase protein. The roles of the P, M, and NV proteins in viral cytopathogenesi​s are reported here. Results of the study, which utilized double transient transfections, northern blot analysis, immunofluoresce​nce confocal microscopy, and electron microscopy suggest that M acts in IHNV infection by shutting down host transcription and triggering programmed cell death. NV expression was found to be associated with cell rounding, a cytopathic characteristic of IHNV-infected cells in culture."
