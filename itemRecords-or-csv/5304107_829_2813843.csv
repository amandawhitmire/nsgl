11,Abstract:,"The Columbia/Snake River system dominates the Pacific Northwest geographically and economically. Few people in the Northwest are untouched by its presence. Some gain their living directly or indirectly from its vast resources for power, navigation, fish, and irrigated agriculture. Others benefit as consumers of abundant and low-priced electricity, fish, food, domestic water, or aesthetic and recreational opportunities. Although the Columbia River is vital to many residents of the Northwest, few people know how the decisions are made which determine how the river is used."
