11,Abstract:,"In recent years, attention has been focused on development of State-Federal Fishery Management Programs, and most recently, the National Fisheries Plan to improve the vitality of fishing firms. Development or determination of appropriate programs requires some knowledge of fishermen's operations and performance; hence, this survey was undertaken to improve understanding of Oregon 's commercial fishermen. This progress report presents some preliminary findings of the survey - specifically, information on (1) socioeconomic characteristics of fishermen, (2) costs and returns from commercial fishing, and (3) fishermen 's income from fishery and nonfishery employment."
