11,Abstract:,"Though shear instability is felt to be important in initiating turbulent mixing in stratified flows, the net effect of an instability on the mean fields is poorly known; observations in natural flows are lacking because of difficulties in identifying instability mechanisms and in measuring enough variables to close an energy budget. Here an energetics analysis is presented of an isolated instability identified by acoustic backscatter. An acoustic Doppler current profiler measured the horizontal currents while the Advanced Microstructure Profiler measured density and the dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy and of temperature variance."
