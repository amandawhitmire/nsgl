11,Abstract:,"Investigations of the role of sea level in producing coastal erosion have focused mainly on the long-term rise due to melting of glaciers and thermal expansion of seawater. There are, however, shorter term changes in the local sea-level produced by a variety of ocean processes. Variations in coastal currents can alter the water level at the shoreline due to the geostrophic balance between the current and the offshore sea-surface slope. Other factors which may alter local sea level include changes in atmospheric pressure, winds blowing in either the longshore or cross-shore direction, and the occurrence of upwelling. In many cases little is known about the coastal response to these shorter-term changes. This paper reviews what is known concerning the physical processes causing these shorter term sea level fluctuations and considers their possible role in producing coastal erosion."
