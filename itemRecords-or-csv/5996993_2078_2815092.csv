12,Abstract:,"Two recent reports, one by the Pew Oceans Commission and the other by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, have taken a new look at the status of living marine resources. The reports agree on the current degraded state of marine ecosystems and its causes, including overfishing, overcapacity, habitat destruction, and land-based pollution. They also agree on a number of fishery management needs: end the race for fish, take an ecosystem- based approach to marine resource management, advocate a regional approach with strong central oversight, support strengthening the role of science in management decisions, and separate ""conservation"" decisions from ""allocation"" decisions. However, the two reports differ substantially in their approaches to implementing change. These differences reflect fundamental philosophical approaches to the operational nature of fishery governance and the achievement of sustainable resource use. After comparing the two reports, the authors recommend a series of short- term and long-term steps that Congress and agencies can take to promote sustainable change in fisheries management."
