The purpose for the meeting and this report is to provide up-​dated information on the status of marine pollution monitoring programs for the next Federal Plan for Ocean Pollution Research Development and Monitoring, mandate by Public Law 95-273, and to assist the host agencies to develop their long-range plans for marine pollution monitoring. The Pasadena meeting was one of six such assemblies held throughout the country during the fall and winter of 1980-​1981. Chapter 1 of this report contains a summary of the background information given at the meeting by NOAA representatives​. Chapter II contains a summary of the key findings and recommendations​ of the meeting.

Ch​apter V contains the summary of three papers presented at the meeting about approaches toward a national monitoring program and the recommendations​ of the attendees about possible implementation strategies. Objectives of the conference were: (1) to identify the marine pollution monitoring programs of the region; (2) to determine the extent to which current monitoring programs address local and regional ocean pollution problems and information requirements; and (3) to assess the requirements for a region-wide ecosystem monitoring program and discuss options of strategy."
