9,Abstract:,"The fierce poetry of the salmon's life appeals to many people: growing up in one environment and being pulled mysteriously to an unknown destiny; experiencing fantastic voyages in the ocean; abruptly being called home to the place of birth; struggling against all odds to reach this home; spawning extravagantly and then dying, but leaving behind enough offspring that some may survive. This short video captures that story with remarkable underwater and above water images that reveal the salmon's world."
