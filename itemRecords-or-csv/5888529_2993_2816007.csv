11,Abstract:,"Pacific whiting (""Merluccius productus"") is the cheapest white fish in the world and abundant in the Pacific Northwest. Most of the catch is commercially processed into either surimi or fillets. These processes utilize less than 30% of the fish. The objectives of this study were to characterize physicochemical and microbiological changes of fish and to determine the potential for making high-quality fish sauce from Pacific whiting and its by-products. Fermentation conditions and the physicochemical transformations during fermentation were also investigated."
