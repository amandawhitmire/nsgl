10,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is the etiologic agent of a disease that causes massive mortalities among hatchery-reared salmon and trout fry. The severity of the economic losses resulting from this disease spurred an attempt to develop an IHNV vaccine. In this study the glycoprotein G alone was shown to be the only viral protein necessary to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, when susceptible salmonid fish were immunized with purified G protein, these fish survived subsequent viral challenge. Antiserum prepared to enzymatically deglycosylated virus was found to contain virus neutralization activity and to react with glycosylated G protein as well. Thus the viral G protein in its nonglycosylated form might be sufficient for a subunit vaccine for IHNV; prokaryotic expression of this viral gene in vaccine development is feasible."
