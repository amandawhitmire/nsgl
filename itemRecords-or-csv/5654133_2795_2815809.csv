13,Abstract:,"Use of Pacific whiting (""Merluccius productus"") has been limited, in spite of abundance, because of soft texture associated with proteolysis of muscle proteins. Production of surimi with addition of protease inhibitors is considered the best method for its utilization. In this study, commonly used protease assays and substrates were compared for sensitivity and simplicity in analyzing proteolytic activity in Pacific whiting causing gel weakening of surimi during heat-setting. Assay based on detection of trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-soluble products, using azocasein as substrate, showed highest sensitivity."
