11,Abstract:,"This richly illustrated, water-resistant book describes 37 species of rockfish found along the U.S. west coast from Oregon to Alaska. The easy-to-use, spiral-bound field guide features vivid color photos of each species, accompanied by concise text and clear line drawings that point out distinguishing characteristics and the geographic range of each species. Now in its fifth printing, with over 18,000 copies sold, this guide is a primary reference for sport and commercial fishermen, seafood buyers and sellers, seafood processing plant workers, charter operators, resource agency managers and scientists, fisheries students, marine educators, scuba divers, naturalists, and other people who are interested in marine resources of the west coast. The 1995 edition has changes that improve accuracy of head spine counts and range/habitat."
