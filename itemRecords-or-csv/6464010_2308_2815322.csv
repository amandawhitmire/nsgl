8,Abstract:,"Western states use a myriad of outreach and regulatory approaches to prevent the entry, establishment and spread of aquatic invaders. The states of Idaho and Washington have funded outreach and mandatory boat inspection stations; in doing so, they have intercepted trailered boats infested with aquatic invasive species, such as zebra and quagga mussels. However, Oregon courts have interpreted Oregon1s constitution to prevent state officials from conducting searches without probable cause by means of mandatory check stations in other contexts, if criminal penalties could result. This raises questions on whether voluntary boat inspections are effective and what actions must be taken to increase the effectiveness of aquatic invasive species prevention programs. Would Oregon1s constitution allow officials to operate mandatory boat inspection stations if no criminal sanctions could result? If so, what is the likely efficacy of mandatory boat inspections if only civil penalties could result? What changes to the constitution, statutes and administrative rules would need to be made to allow mandatory boat inspections for the effective control of invasive species? What combination of mandatory inspections, outreach, and voluntary actions would effectively lessen the threat and spread of aquatic invasive species? This project included three phases of research and outreach on effective combinations of regulatory and voluntary measures to minimize the threat of invasive species movement from contaminated vehicles and boats into, within and out of the state. This report includes the findings from a portion of Phase I of this project. Specifically, telephone interviews were conducted with aquatic invasive species program leads in other western states to research effective regulatory approaches to limit the spread of AIS in locations where those species currently exist (e.g., quagga mussels in Lake Mead) or have a high risk of being invaded."
