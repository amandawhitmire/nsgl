11,Abstract:,"The economic potential of the continental shelf lies in the exploitation of its fisheries and of its mineral wealth. The purpose of this publication is to provide, to those who can use it, information concerning the surface of the Continental shelf - its shape, and what the bottom is made of. The information provided here is a result of the efforts of a number of the staff and students of the Department of Oceanography at Oregon State University. The original scientific research was carried out under contract with the Office of Naval Research. Bathymetric and Sediment charts are included."
