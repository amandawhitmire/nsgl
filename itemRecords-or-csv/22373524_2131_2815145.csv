17,Abstract:,"Working waterfront industries are reliant upon water access and encompass everything from wild harvest and cultured seafood to towboats, shipping, and marine research. Many of the industries along Oregon’s working waterfronts are inaccessible to the public or hard to see, even though they play critical social and economic roles in the local community. Working waterfront industries thrive when there is local understanding of, and support for, the work and the people doing this work. This chapter explores the connection between working waterfront industries and coastal community resilience and vitality using examples of infrastructure, family and gender, education, and changing demographics."
