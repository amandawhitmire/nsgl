14,Abstract:,"Most newly married couples begin life together with an idealized image of their partners and the relationship. In focus groups with women married to commercial fishermen, the authors found that to be especially true of fishing marriages: The fishing life seems 'romantic,' yet fraught with worries--about their husbands' safety, family finances and the uncertainties of the industry. This short publication, based on advice from fishing families as well as literature about family stability offers tips to help fishing couples cope with the phases of marriage, from the early years to becoming parents and rearing children."
