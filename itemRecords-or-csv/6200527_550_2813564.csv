The goal is to include information about what's happening in Oregon's commercial fishing industry such as new boats in the fleets, vessels under construction, new or modified gear and equipment being used, new ideas being tested, etc. Coverage of commercial fishing activities on the entire coasts will be a regular feature of all future newsletters. The newsletter will also be used as a vehicle to increase communications between commercial fishermen in the state. Topics include: Noise and fish: A new wrinkle; Loran-C plans; Rules of the road; Pennsylvania doctrine rule: Drifting and limited visibility questions; lure color and depth of water; wash box design; salmon; U.S. Coast Guard and oil pollution regulations; body heat as water survival; chum salmon return; urethane insulation; sink or send? Emergency radio batteries; engine room topics; limited entry; prop shroud; wire capacity of winch drums; life in a raft; survival tips."
