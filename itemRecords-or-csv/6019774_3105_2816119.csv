10,Abstract:,"World fisheries are good examples of the magnitude of the changes affecting common property resources. They illustrate the pressures exerted on tradition in an age of globalization that is characterized by the expansion of markets and the integration of environmental policies. Globalization of environmental policy is affecting fisheries in the recovery of overfished stocks, the vesting of use rights, the protection of biodiversity and the advancement toward ecosystem management. This manuscript focuses on biodiversity protection as an example of the challenges associated with finding an effective blend of tradition and change in an era of globalization and in moving from theory to practice. Marine ecosystems are forms of natural capital that provide value in stocks and flows of goods and services. Goods are used directly as seafood, Pharmaceuticalsâ€‹, oils and additives. Services are used indirectly through their contribution to ecosystem resilience, genetic diversity, and aesthetic appreciation. Biodiversity can be viewed in a number of dimensions, including the diversity of species, genetic material and functional roles. The capital properties of ecosystems means that biodiversity can be sustained only through maintaining a balance of stocks and flows and ensuring healthy ecosystem functions. Restoring marine ecosystem biodiversity is an internationally recognized need. This restoration will require increased biological knowledge, but it will also require a much better understanding of human behavior, particularly in fisheries, the main extractive use. Restoring and maintaining biodiversity is ultimately a problem of controlling human use, and is therefore a problem of common property resource management. It is also an area in which tradition and globalization are in tension."
