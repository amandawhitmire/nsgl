15,Abstract:,"A variable frequency capacitive dielectric heating (CDH) system was used to heat surimi seafoods, alfalfa and radish seeds. Packaged food and seed samples were heated to the pasteurization temperatures of 70 to 85 deg C within the frequency range of 31 MHz to 39 MHz. Frequency was adjusted manually during the heating process to control the impedance match between power generator and the samples being heated. Various electrode configurations (shapes and sizes), air gap, and package designs were tested for their ability to achieve maximum heating rates and temperature uniformity. Uniformity was checked using four to six fiber-optic temperature probes inserted in the food packages. The temperature-​time profiles were recorded and heating rates were calculated accordingly. Maximum heating rates of 103 deg C/min for alfalfa seeds and 20 deg C/min for surimi seafood were achieved. The maximum temperature difference between the center and the edge of the heated samples was less than 3 deg C during heating. Results show that system impedance is temperature-​sensitive. For heating foods, a CDH system with automated impedance control is essential for achieving maximum heating rates with minimum power. To avoid arcing and heating run- away, optimization of electrode configurations, cavity design and configuration of food packages has to be achieved."
