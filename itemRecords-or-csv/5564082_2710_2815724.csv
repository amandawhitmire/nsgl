11,Abstract:,"The use of polyphosphates (straight chains with three or more phoshorus atoms) to improve yield and quality of seafoods has been well documented. This investigation was undertaken to determine if treating raw butchered crab in a solution of polyphosphate, prior to cooking, would improve meat yeild and quality. Optimum meat yield, quality and frozen storage stability was achieved by soaking raw sections in 10% polyphosphate and then cooking in steam for a minimum time for complete protein coagulation. Moisture and proteins rich in phosphorus, retained by polyphosphate treatment, and cooking in steam (rather than water) were believed responsible for improving meat yield, quality and storage stability."
