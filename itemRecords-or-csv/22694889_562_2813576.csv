14,Abstract:,"The population of Southern Resident killer whales has been on the decline for decades, dropping 20% since the mid 1990s. Starvation appears to be a factor in the deaths of many of these whales. The Southern Resident killer whales survive mainly on a diet of Chinook salmon, which is another species in decline due to a variety of human impacts. In this lesson, students explore how the selective feeding practices of Southern Resident killer whales contribute to their declining numbers. Learni​ng Goals: Students in grade level 9-12 will learn the following: • Southern Resident killer whale (SRKW) and Chinook salmon populations are in significant decline due to the impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems. • Environmental changes affect food web dynamics. • SRKWs and juvenile Chinook salmon are selective feeders. • Effective species recovery plans for SRKW and Chinook salmon include an understanding of ecosystem relationships. ​Learning Objectives: Students will be able to: 1. Graph SRKW and Chinook salmon population data over time to explain trends and to make predictions. 2. Use data to explain relationships between selective feeding, population trends, and global climate change. 3. Identify policies that could help aid species recovery effort."
