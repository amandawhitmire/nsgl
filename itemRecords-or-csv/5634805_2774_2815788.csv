12,Abstract:,"In the last decade, the marine algae have become recognized as a rich source of novel oxylipins (oxylipin is a new term referring to fatty acids of all chain lengths oxidized by at least one step of mono- or dioxygenase-​dependent oxygenation), many of which appear to result from biosynthetic events without direct parallel to eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways in mammalian systems. The red alga ""Lithothamnion corallioides"" produces a diversity of normal lipoxygenase products in addition to the novel compound 13- hydroxyarachido​nic acid. The source and stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group in this unusual oxylipin metabolite have been determined, along with its facile chemical conversion of 1 into both 11- and 15-HETE."
