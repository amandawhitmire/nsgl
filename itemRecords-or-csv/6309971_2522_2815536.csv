12,Abstract:,"Scientific visualizations are ubiquitous in science and science education settings. Although visualizations can often convey more meaningful information in less space than comparable text to specialized audiences, visualizations are often meaningless to non-experts. Just as it takes time and practice to meaningfully interpret the results of a scientific experiment, it takes time and practice to interpret scientific visualizations. With the Science on a Sphere (SOS) network in place in 37 ISEs around the country and various other forms of spherical display systems, non-scientists are gaining unprecedented access to highly complex data visualizations in a new and exciting mode of presentation. These spherical display systems have a high initial ""Wow factor,"" but without significant attention to non-scientists' needs, they remain apparatuses with little lasting impact on visitors' understanding of the concepts shown on the sphere. In partnership with higher educational institutions and ISE's research is underway to unmask the context needed for visitor meaning making. Our data show that when visualizations are simply repurposed rather than being redesigned with new end users in mind, visitors are not able to fully use the visualizations for meaning making. In this session, we will describe efforts made to understand ISE visitors' understanding of a variety of visualizations on spherical display systems in three institutions as well as basic findings related to redesigned visualizations and the factors shaping meaningful visitor interaction with visualizations. If the preliminary research is an indication of future findings, the results will add in the dissemination of information from the scientific community to the non-purposeful user."
