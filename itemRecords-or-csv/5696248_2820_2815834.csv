13,Abstract:,"Although food-grade inhibitors may control proteolytic activity in surimi, questions remain concerning the proteolysis mechanism. The type of degradation pattern that protease produces with surimi proteins has not been determined. Cathepsins B and H are highly active lysosomal cysteine proteasees in addition to cathepsin L. The effects of washing on those enzymes during surimi processing and their contribution to gel weakening have not been established. The objectives of this study were to establish the contribution of cysteine cathepsins to surimi gel weakening and to investigate the participation and the mechanism of cathepsin L in degradation of surimi myofibrils."
