13,Abstract:,"The actinosporean life stge of ""Ceratomyxa shasta"", a myxozoan parasite of salmonids, and the annelid worm that serves as its alternate host were identified in laboratory transmission experiments and their roles were confirmed using molecular techniques. Ultrastructural examination of the actinosporean in the polychaete showed developmental stages in the epidermis rather than within the intestinal epithelium as described for other myxozoans. The methods described will be useful in identifying alternate hosts and morphologically diverse life stages in the complex life cycles of other myxosporea, and in understanding the relationships between these parasites and their hosts."
