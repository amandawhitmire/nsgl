13,Abstract:,"To explore the potential of green algae to produce halogenated secondary metabolites in the context of an exploration of Puerto Rican seaweeds as a source of new biomedicinals, the authors have investigated the natural products of the tropical green alga ""Avrainvillea nigricans"". In addition to finding halogenated metabolites previously reported from ""A. longicaulis"", as well as from Rhodophyta species, a new diphenylmethane derivative containing two bromine atoms and possessing moderate antibiotic activity against several human pathogens is discussed here."
