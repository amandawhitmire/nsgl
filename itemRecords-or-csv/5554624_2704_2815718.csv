12,Abstract:,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus that produces an acute disease in salmon and trout resulting from the destruction of the hematopoietic tissue in the kidneys. An analysis of the virion protein patterns of 71 isolates of IHNV led to the classification of these virus isolates into five different types. However, the need for an IHNV vaccine to control the spread of this disease in the environment has made it important to determine whether there is also a biological basis for distinguishing these five electropherotyp​es. In the study reported here, an effort was made to determine whether there was any correlation between electropherotyp​es and reactivity to polyclonal rabbit anti-IHNV sera in virus neutralization assays."
