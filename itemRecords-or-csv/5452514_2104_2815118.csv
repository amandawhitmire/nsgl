9,Abstract:,"While ports in the Pacific Northwest have benefited directly from comprehensive management studies, nonstudied ports can also learn from the experience and the knowledge gained. This publication captures the experience and knowledge from previous comprehensive management studies and presents it in the form of a comprehensive management study report to the purely fictitious Port of Beaver."
