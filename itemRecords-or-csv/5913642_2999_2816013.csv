15,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to identify distribution of histamine-​producing bacteria in fresh albacore and to monitor prevalent histamine formers and histamine accumulation during storage at ambient temperature. Total bacterial counts and histamine contents in fish muscles were evaluated, and histamine-​producing bacteria were identified to species."
