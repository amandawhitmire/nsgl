12,Abstract:,"Something troubling is taking hold in Oregon. Strange, exotic plants and animals are showing up in places where they don't belong. It's a silent invasion that's destroying our most precious places, driving away wildlife and making everyone, from ranchers to fishermen to wildlife managers, nervous. This one hour DVD is a call to action with one goal in mind: turn Oregonians' love of their state into a campaign to protect it from invasive species. ""Stop the Invasion"" campaign partners include the Oregon Invasive Species Council; SOLV; The Nature Conservancy; and Oregon Sea Grant."
