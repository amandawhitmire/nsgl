10,Abstract:,"The United States has threatened or imposed trade restrictions for a variety of extraterritoria​l marine conservation purposes including concerns over commercial whaling, dolphin mortality, the use of high seas driftnets and the drowning deaths of sea turtles in shrimp fishing nets. On several occasions these environment-​related trade restrictions have been challenged as illegal obstacles to free trade under the dispute settlement provisions of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO). The author of this article analyzes in detail the actions and role of the WTO in conflicts between international trade and law and environmental interests. He characterizes current GATT/WTO case law as confusing and sometimes contradictory, and advocates the adoption of a modified utilitarian model based on fairness in determining compensation to property owners for certain governmental restrictions."
