11,Abstract:,"Upon listing of several Pacific Northwest populations of salmon under the Endangered Species Act, a considerable amount of political attention, funding, and human resources have been devoted to collaborative watershed planning throughout the region. Increasingly, such partnerships are initiated through legislation and agency directives. For this report, the authors gathered data on 35 watershed partnerships in Washington and Oregon to examine how they implement policy objectives and how they are creating or modifying institutions for planning and implementation. The challenges of the collaborative process itself, participation, implementation, and capacity all suggest potential design or programmatic changes. This study underscores the important relationships between policy design and implementation via the development and evolution of collaborative institutions that subsequently become the linchpins for effective policy formulation and implementation. Despite devolution of some responsibility, states may be required to play a larger and more sustained role in fostering the development of local institutions capable of overcoming the challenges described."
