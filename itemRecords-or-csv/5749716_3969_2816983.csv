13,Abstract:,"Analysis of tagging data, distribution of adults, available spawning habitat and egg distribution suggests that the Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay estuaries serve as nursery area for English sole that spawn as far south as central Oregon. Few studies to date have dealt with juvenile recruitment variation for English sole. In this paper, recruitment, density, spatial distribution and their variability are assessed for English sole in Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay and the adjacent nearshore area."
