11,Abstract:,"Major national legislation and jurisdictional issues related to ocean resource protection and management are reviewed. Because there is no unified national policy, national, state, and local agencies attempt to manage resources with overlapping programs and jurisdictions, and interagency conflicts. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) provides states with a framework for designing their coastal management plans and is the best existing mechanism to make federal agency decisions compatible with state interests. Because it is unclear which federal actions taken beyond states' territorial seas are subject to the CZMA consistency requirements, conflicts arise between regulations embodied in state coastal plans and actions of the federal government on the outer continental shelf. Water pollution control falls to agencies with potentially conflicting priorities, e.g., the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers. The courts have denied challenges to mineral and gas exploitation at the lease stage, preventing initial-stage review of actions that might threaten the environment. Some attempts to provide mechanisms for resolving interagency conflicts have been incorporated in the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the consistency process in the CZMA."
