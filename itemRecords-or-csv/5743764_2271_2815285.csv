11,Abstract:,"This paper begins with a review of the several measurement systems and the data derived from them. The first analysis involves an examination of the data obtained from deep-water buoys. The measurements from inshore CDIP arrays are then evaluated using linear-wave theory to transform that data to the equivalent deep-water wave parameters. Consideration then turns to the microseismometeâ€‹r system, its calibration, and analyses of the long-term wave measurements derived from that system. Finally, the paper examines the most extreme wave conditions that have occurred during the years covered by these combined data sets, allowing estimates to be made of the expected 50-year and 100-year storm-wave parameters."
