15,Abstract:,"Experiments conducted with the cultured marine cyanobacterium ""L. majuscula"" show that barbamide biosynthesis involves chlorination of the unactivated ""pro- S"" methyl group of leucine (or a leucine-derived intermediate), a result which leads to the authors' speculation that novel biochemistry, possibly of a radical nature, may be involved in the chlorination mechanism."
