13,,"The correlation of wave groups with damage to the armor layer of conventional mound breakwaters has been a controversial topic during the last decade. This paper presents a theory for correlating wave grouping with damage to rubble mound breakwaters. Details of the experimental facilities and physical model are given, and the technique and criteria used to measure armor profiles and armor damage are described and compared with other recommended methods. Damage is correlated with two independent wave grouping characteristicsâ€‹: the mean run length related to the spectral shape, and the flux of energy pattern related to the envelope exceedance coefficient."
