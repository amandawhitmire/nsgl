13,Abstract:,"This article is intended to be a synthesis of the disciplines of landscape ecology of rivers and behavioral ecology of fish as they relate to a potential union. It outlines the historical context and current direction of research on riverine landscapes, highlights relevant themes in behavioral ecology as they relate to stream fish, and proposes a 'behaviorscape' approach to stream fish ecology, starting with examples of research that partially or completely meet the expectations of the union and ending with a justification of four principles for behaviorscapes."
