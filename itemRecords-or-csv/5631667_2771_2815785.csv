11,Abstract:,"Three species of brown algae, ""Laminaria sinclairii"", ""L. saccharina"" and ""L. setchellii"", have been investigated for the presence of oxylipins. From one, ""L. sinclairii"", three new divinyl ether fatty acids have been characterized as methyl ester derivatives by a variety of spectroscopic methods. In addition, one new and four known monohydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acids have been isolated from all three species as their methyl ester derivatives. The occurrence of these compounds in brown algae strongly suggests that these organisms possess active lipoxygenase(s) with omega 6 specificity."
