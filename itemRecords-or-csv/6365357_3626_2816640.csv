12,Abstract:,"The Salmon River estuary has been a key site for studies of estuarine ecosystem recovery for over three decades. Our project continues the work of others in examining whether biological communities can be restored in previously diked tidal marshes. A staggered pattern of dike removal in three of the marshes, plus the presence of a never-diked marsh, allows us to make comparisons of vegetation-​based and benthic invertebrate communities among marshes in different recovery stages and with the reference marsh. We can also directly examine changes over time in individual marshes by comparing our results to previous datasets. We also plan to explore interannual variability and the role of abiotic factors in influencing the composition of the invertebrate communities. A unique aspect of this project is the inclusion of biology majors in all aspects of the research. Collection of invertebrates with insect fallout traps and benthic cores, along with sample sorting, is integrated into the Principal Investigator's upper-division Marine Ecology course. Advanced undergraduates serve as field team leaders. Some students also conduct independent research linked to the project."
