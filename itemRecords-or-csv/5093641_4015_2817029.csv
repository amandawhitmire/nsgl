7,Abstract:,"What is this phantom that some people talk about with fear or regret while others laugh it off as a hoax? Let this be said, salmon poisoning is a very real disease of dogs, but it is limited to a narrow band of the northern Pacific Coast; specifically, western areas of northern California, Oregon and southern Washington west of the Cascade Mountains. In fact, for those in northern California, Mad River (near Arcata) is usually agreed on as the southern limit of this disease. Because of this narrow range of the disease, dogs are never troubled with it unless they eat salmon, trout, or some freshwater fish from our north Pacific Coast. This brochure talks about what this disease is , how dogs get it, how it is treated, and important things to remember."
