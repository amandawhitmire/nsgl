7,Abstract:,"The Blue Heron Bowl is a regional marine science quiz bowl. Two teams, each composed of four students and one alternate, square off against each other to answer questions related to marine science. Many of these students are coached by a marine science or general science teacher that sponsors their training. The bowl, itself consists of a set of matches. Each match consists of six minutes of toss-up and bonus questions, followed by two team challenge questions, and ending with a final six minutes of toss-up and bonus questions. The year's theme was ""Blue Energy-Powering the Planet with our Ocean."" Thirteen teams participated in the Blue Heron bowl held on February 18, 2017 at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics came out on top this year and will go on to compete at the 20th Annual 2017 National Ocean Sciences Bowl (NOSB) Finals Competition, April 20-23, 2017 at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon."
