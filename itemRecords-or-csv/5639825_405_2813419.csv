12,Abstract:,"In this richly illustrated volume, the fourth in a series, an international group of specialists representing the United States, Japan, China, Chile, Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Philippines describe the results of a workshop on the taxonomy of the groups ""Sargassum"", ""Gelidium"", ""Gracilaria"", and ""Ahnfeltiopsis""​. To be able to use the Okamura and Hokkaido University herbaria and to obtain books that most have seen only in photocopy form at best was a thrill for all who participated in the fourth workshop. It illustrated the seriousness that the Japanese accord to phycology, and the strong direction provided by having continuous professors of botany (phycology), with all that implies in terms of facilities, publications, and widespread interest and support."
