11,Abstract:,"In part because of its deep-water habitat, certain life history aspects of of ""Chionoecetes tanneri"" are not well known. Samples collected mainly from a series of cruises off the Oregon coast from 1972 to 1975 have yielded ""C. tanneri"" specimens from the first crab stage to adult. These specimens have made it possible to identify a series of early instars and to determine juvenile growth rates; they also provided life history information on size at maturity and adult and juvenile sex ratios for comparison with earlier work. In addition, observations of the carapace condition of adults helped to substantiate the anecdysic condition of adult females."
