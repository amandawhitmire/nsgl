11,Abstract:,"Common sense and published literature both assert that education research isoften dismissed by practitioners on the grounds that it is irrelevant to their work. Somehave argued that this is due primarily to a mismatch of professional epistemologies. Whileagreeing in principle, this work draws on work in sociology (Erving Goffman) and literarytheory (Mikhail Bakhtin) to argue that practitioner mistrust of research may be primarilyrelate​d to differences in the presentation of self in the teaching (and research) professionand a history of research used as a tool of transgression in the authorship of the practitionerpro​fessional self. Goffman’s account of frontstage and backstage settings in the everydaypresent​ation of self is combined with Bakhtin’s account of the ways research erases thevoice of practitioners by reducing their fundamentally dialogic experiences to monologicnarrat​ives dominated by the voice of the researcher. As an alternative, I draw on the workof the research psychologist Jerome Bruner and the practicing clinical psychologistMic​hael White to explore ways in which practitioners might be more meaningfullyeng​aged in the research enterprise through a process of re-​narrativizing their own experiencescapt​ured as part of research. Narrative techniques that help share responsibility forauthoring accounts of practice among researchers and practitioners as research participantsare described leading to conclusions about the potential transformative nature of such workfor both researchers and practitioners."
