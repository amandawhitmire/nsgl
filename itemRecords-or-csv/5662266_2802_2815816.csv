11,Abstract:,"Lipid extracts of several collections of the tropical red marine alga ""Murrayella periclados"" were found to be rich sources of eicosanoids more commonly associated with mammalian systems, including 12""S""-​hydroxyeicosape​ntaenoic acid, 12""S""- hydroxyeicosate​traenoic acid (12""S""-HEPE), (6""E"")-​leukotriene B4, and ""erythro"" and ""threo"" diastereomers of hepoxilins B3 and B4. This is the first report of leukotriene or hepoxilin B4 natural products from a plant, and several spectroscopic features of these molecules are reported herein for the first time. Two conjugated triene-​containing eicosanoids were also found in the algal extract. A 12-lipoxygenase initiated biosynthetic origin is proposed for most of these ""Murrayella"" oxylipins."
