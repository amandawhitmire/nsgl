11,Abstract:,"At low temperatures, poikilotherm cell membranes normally existing in a fluid, liquid-​crystalline state undergo a phase transition to a `frozen' gel state which affects membrane properties. Many poikilotherms compensate for such effects by increasing the relative proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the phospholipids of cell membranes. Reported here is a preliminary analysis of the phospholipid fatty acid composition of ""Paralvinella palmiformis"", a polychaete found at hydrothermal vents. Animals from both low- and high-​temperature sites are compared."
