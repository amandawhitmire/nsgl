12,Abstract:,"The optimal temperature and illumination photoperiod requirements for the phototrophic growth of a novel microplantlet suspension culture derived from the macrophytic marine red alga ""Agardhiella subulata"" were determined. Researchers first studied the short- and long- term effects of temperature on the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate of the microplantlets suspension culture. They also studied the effect of diurnal photoperiod on biomass production in a bubble-column photobioreactor​, and developed a simple mathematical model to predict the effect of photoperiod on biomass production under resource- saturated conditions."
