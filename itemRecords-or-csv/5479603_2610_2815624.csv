11,Abstract:,"As a fundamental component of the law surrounding submerged lands development, the public trust doctrine must be acknowledged; however, it is not of great help in resolving submerged lands use conflicts. Because public trust law does not assign priorities among the permissible public trust uses of submerged lands, other approaches to resolving use conflicts are needed. Techniques for avoiding or reducing conflicts include: multiple-use planning to identify potential conflicts; separating exploration and development rights to remove legal impediments to conflict avoidance; using activity schedules, corridors, and buffer zones to avoid conflicts; coordinating federal and state planning and permit processes to reduce conflicts; and providing compensation for unavoidable conflicts."
