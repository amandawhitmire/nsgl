12,Abstract:,"Money is a powerful necessity. It can bring joy or cause fear and resentment. Yet despite its importance in family life, parents tend to shy away from discussing money with their children and teaching them lessons essential to the development of their financial literacy. This publication describes basic principles about money and suggests ways to teach children, from toddlers to teens, how to manage it. Directed at fishing families, the pamphlet is nonetheless applicable to families in all walks of life. This is a publication of the Adapting to Change: Patterns of Involvement Project."
