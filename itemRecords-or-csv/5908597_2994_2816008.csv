14,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to monitor Pacific mackerel for product safety under various storage conditions. Histamine production and bacterial growth were monitored on fish under storage at 0 to 25?C. Several groups of bacteria were isolated using selective media, and the confirmed histamine formers were identified to species."
