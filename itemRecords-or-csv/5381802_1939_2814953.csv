13,Abstract:,"A study was undertaken to describe the changes in circulating levels of specific hormones during sexual maturation in coho salmon and to correlate these changes to development in the gonads. Previous studies found that the circulating levels of the various steroids in coho salmon that were held in seawater differed from those in fish held in fresh water; thus, the susceptibility of coho salmon to hormone-induced ovulation may be partly compromised in seawater. Levels of the hormones described in the present study were measured in coho salmon held in both seawater and fresh water to determine if any differences occurred in the endocrine profiles of fish held in either environment."
