15,Abstract:,"The Fishermen-Led Injury Prevention Program (FLIPP) is an innovative research project that involves commercial fishermen, researchers, extension agents, and coastal community members to better understand injuries at sea. The project is lead by the OSU College of Public Health  and Human Sciences and Oregon Sea Grant, a partnership that merges occupational safety research with experience working directly with the commercial fishing industry."
