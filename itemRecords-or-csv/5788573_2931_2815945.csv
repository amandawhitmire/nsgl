16,Abstract:,"Macrophytic marine algae, commonly known as seaweeds, are a rich source of unique natural products, many of which possess significant medicinal potential. Of particular interest are bioactive compounds produced through the regio- and stereo-​selective oxidation of fatty acids or the halogenation of terpenoids. Cell and tissue suspension culture systems established from macroalgae have the potential to biosynthesize these compounds in a controlled environment at a scale required for continued drug development or commercial production. The authors have developed several unique photolithotroph​ic suspension culture systems representing all three major classes of marine macroalgae, including a gametophyte cell culture, a filamentous semidifferentia​ted tissue culture, a callus- derived clumped cell suspension culture, and a freely suspended microplantlet culture. The controlled cultivation of these culture systems was accomplished in externally illuminated stirred-tank, bubble-column, and biocoil reactor systems."
