11,Abstract:,"Use this comprehensive species module for an in-depth understanding of zebra and quagga mussels. Modules include a comprehensive species guide, a species-​at-​a-​glance fact sheet, a related lesson plan, suggested activies, comprehension questions, and videos and related on-line resources. Colonies of millions of quagga and zebra mussels foul and clog pipes, water treatment plants, and dam turbines and give a competitive boost to toxic algae. It takes only one contaminated boat and the right conditions for zebra and quagga mussels to infest a new watershed; once they have been introduced and start to flourish, they are virtually impossible to control."
