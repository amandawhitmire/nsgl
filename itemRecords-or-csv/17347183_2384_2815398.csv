9,Abstract:,"Marine Debris is a complex, real-world problem which can be addressed through the lenses of several different academic subjects. This curriculum integrates the subject areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math, and Social Studies (STEAMSS), and focuses on experiential hands-on activities for students in grades 4 through 12. The collected teacher-tested resources enable educators to create in-depth, project based learning (PBL) units, work with teaching partners across disciplines, and find classroom and field experiences that will help students explore the issue and impacts of marine debris and engage in stewardship actions. Lessons include opportunities for students to: collect and analyze data, address problems through engineering design, use technology and art to effectively convey stewardship messages, contribute to clean up efforts, and work with community partners. Access the Marine Debris STEAMSS Curriculum by clicking on the grade band on the site. There are bands for grades 4-5, 6-8, and 9-12. Navigate through the modules using the menu provided on the right side of the website."
