14,Abstract:,"This publication explains in words and images how El Nino works, and some of the ways it affects everything from the weather to fisheries productivity. The full-color, eight- page publication is intended for a broad audience, including people who live and work on the Pacific coast, weather buffs and anyone interested in understanding the complex interplay between wind, current, and water temperature in the Pacific Ocean. It should be of special interest to members of the Pacific fishing industry trying to cope with dramatic changes in stock supplies and associated restrictions on what they are permitted to catch."
