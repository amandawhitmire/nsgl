14,Abstract:,"Major histocompatibil​ity complex (MHC) and immune-relevant gene markers were used to evaluate differences in reproductive success (RS) among naturally spawning coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch mate pairs involving an alternative male reproductive phenotype, known as jacks. These mate pairs included both hatchery-reared and wild origin fish such that three classes were evaluated in two consecutive years (2005 and 2006) using a previously constructed multigeneration​al genetic pedigree: wild × wild (W × W), hatchery × hatchery (H × H) and wild × hatchery (W × H). Oncorhynchus kisutch jack mate pairs mated randomly based on immune-relevant genotype in both years; a result consistent with the opportunistic mating strategy of jacks. An association between greater number of alleles shared at three immune-relevant gene markers and increased RS was found for: W × H mate pairs in 2005 (BHMS429),W×Hpa​irs in 2006 (SsalR016TKU) andW×Wpairs in 2006 (OMM3085). No correlation between immune gene diversity and RS was found for H × H pairs in either year. The results suggest that the influence of immune-relevant genotype on mating success may be different for jacks when compared with previous studies of large adult male O. kisutch."
