12,Abstract:,"This document summarizes Oregon Sea Grant's mission and the values that create its vision. It also outlines the program's goals and subgoals. The intention is that their functional planning will provide guidance for improving the program's performance and will allow the program to be both deliberate and responsive, changing with fluctuating needs and circumstances while retaining the best of what works. In addition, this document outlines the processes they use to identify priority issues or themes, and it briefly describes the program's most current thematic goals. In other words, this plan describes both how they intend to do business and what issues, problems, and opportunities will receive most of our attention in the period 2003-2008."
