12,Abstract:,"Surface-water waves may cause significant seabed deformation, and even liquefaction, leading to large-scale mass movement of soil. These responses tend to be amplified near bottom-founded structures, such as caissons, pipelines, and footings. Wave-induced structure motion also induces responses in the surrounding seabed. Caissons are frequently founded on rubble bedding layers to reduce differential settlement and eccentric loading. The caisson motion is transmitted to the subgrade through the permeable yet stiff rubble base. This paper presents an analytical model to estimate the soil responses induced by wave and caisson motion for a rigid caisson founded on a bedding layer overlying a poroelastic seabed of finite depth. The soil responses include stresses, displacements, and porewater pressure."
