14,Abstract:,"The aquarium trade in west Hawaii removes over 300,000 fish from coral reefs each year. Recent discussions have centered on managing fish collection methods, a topic that is not well-studied. We examined reef fish collection methods that fishers implement to mitigate barotrauma, a suite of symptoms caused by a forced ascent from depth. Venting (puncturing the swim bladder to release gas that has expanded with decreased depth and pressure) and allowing more time for natural decompression are two such methods. We studied the effects of three decompression treatments (fast, intermediate, slow) and venting (no, yes) on fish mortality. In Z. flavescens collected from 20m, post-collection mortality was associated with fast decompression and no venting, and occurred within 24 hours of capture. The most popular methods in the fishery, fast or intermediate decompression followed by venting, resulted in no mortality. Though fish were held for 21 days following capture with no delayed mortality, it is possible that stressors following collection such as transport, air travel, and holding in export, import, and retail facilities could exacerbate sub-lethal effects inflicted during collection."
