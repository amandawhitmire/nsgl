16,Abstract:,"Researchers describe the integration of seafloor transect data gathered by a manned submersible with high-resolution sonar imagery to produce a habitat-based stock assessment system for groundfish. The data sets used in this study were collected from Heceta Bank, Oregon. The authors describe how data are extrapolated based on the relationships of fish abundance and habitat variability."
