12,Abstract:,"A multi-frequency ohmic heating system with a 30 Hz~1 MHz frequency range and capability to deliver 250 w of power has been developed for measuring electrical conductivity and absolute dielectric loss of food samples. Pacific whiting surimi paste and stabilized mince were tested with applied frequencies from 55 Hz to 200 KHz in the temperature range 20~70 degrees C. The study has shown that in the studied range, the sample impedance has a weak relationship with applied frequency. See digital copy for more of the abstract."
