10,Abstract:,"In 1994, the federal government recognized the Pacific Northwest salmon disaster and allocated more than $24 million for disaster relief programs in Oregon, Washington, and California. What do past and present Oregon troll permit holders think about their fishery and the adequacy of disaster relief programs? How are trollers adapting to changes in the salmon industry? This report, the second in a series (see also ORESU-​S-​96-​001), presents the results of a survey and series of interviews examining these questions. While relief programs have helped many trollers, there is also a widespread sense of anger and frustration about the way the programs have been managed."
