10,Abstract:,"Fisheries are commonly defined and managed on a biological, single species basis. Linkages between stocks created by the operation of multipurpose fishing fleets create new fishery systems that cross species boundaries. Linkages between fisheries have both a biological and economic basis. This paper describes an important three-fishery system on the West Coast: groundfish trawl, shrimp trawl, and crab posts; the nature of fishery interactions is described. Factors linking the fisheries are detailed, including biological dynamics, economic dynamics, and risk reduction strategies. Implications of the three-fishery system for fishery management are discussed in the context of the timing of fishing seasons, interstate fishing effort, access limiation, and multifishery management."
