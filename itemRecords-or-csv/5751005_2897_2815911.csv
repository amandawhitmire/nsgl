11,Abstract:,"Intracellular, gram-negative, procaryotic organisms infect a wide range of aquatic poikilotherms. Both pathogenic and benign infections are observed, and occasionally, these intracellular bacteria are highly virulent. Rickettsial and chlamydial taxonomy has not been clearly established; only two have been assigned at the species level, and only one has been isolated and characterized in vitro. A complete understanding of the intracellular bacteria infecting aquatic poikilotherms and determination of their relationships to each other and to described rickettsial and chlamydial species is dependent on the development of techniques for laboratory maintenance and culture."
