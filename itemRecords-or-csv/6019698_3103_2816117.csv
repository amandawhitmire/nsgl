13,Abstract:,"A novel tricyclic oxylipin containing delta-lactone, cyclopentane and epoxide rings and a conjugated diene, has been isolated from the marine red alga Agardhiella subulata. The structure, including partial stereochemistry​, was determined by NMR and GC-MS analysis of menthoxycarbony​l derivatives."
