12,Abstract:,"Dulse was used as a settlement substrate and as a food for different stages of the life-cycle of the red abalone. Dulse was found superior to kelp in conditioning brookstock, resulting in eggs of higher dry weight, lipid and protein content. Improved egg quality resulted in higher hatching and metamorphosis success of larvae. Juvenile abalone 3 to 6.5 mm in shell length grew faster on dulse than on diatom coatings. Abalone 10 mm in shell length grew well when fed on dulse over a 12-month period. Use of dulse throughout the abalone's life cycle should simplify the production process and reduce costs."
