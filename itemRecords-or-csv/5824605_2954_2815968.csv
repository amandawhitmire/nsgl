12,Abstract:,A method is presented that allows for the convenient and reliable determination of 1H-1H NMR coupling constants in higher order or symmetrically coupled spin systems. The method can be applied on any programmable FT-NMR spectrometer and is demonstrated here on micromole quantities of sample in a standard 5-mm NMR tube.
