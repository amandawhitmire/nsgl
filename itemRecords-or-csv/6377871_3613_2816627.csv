19,Abstract:,"Mesozooplankton (> 200 Î¼m) collected throughout August and September of 2010 from the northern Gulf of Mexico show evidence of exposure via trophic transfer to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) derived from oil released from the ruptured British Petroleum Macondo-1 (M-1) well associated with the R/V Deepwater Horizon blowout. Mesozooplankton tissue contained 0.03 - 97.9 ng g-1 of total PAHs. Alkylated PAHs were elevated relative to non-alkylated parent PAHs, indicating a petrogenic source. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that distributions of PAHs extracted from mesozooplankton tissue were closely related to the PAH signature of the M-1 well. The distribution of PAHs isolated from mesozooplankton tissue extracted in this study shows that the spill event was the primary contributor to their contamination. The results suggest that bioaccumulation of PAHs likely occurred during the spill event."
