10,Abstract:,"The first Columbia River salmon cannery was erected in 1866. By 1936 the Pacific canned salmon pack was almost 11 million cases and annual per capita consumption almost 1.5 kg. But this was a fleeting episode. By 1950, per capita consumption had dropped to a little over half a kg; by 1973 the annual pack was only 3 million cases. Salmon, once touted as `cheaper than meat', had become a luxury item, and its primary harvester had become a recreational angler. The economic and social reasons for this decline are discussed; any significant revival of the industry will clearly, however, involve aquaculture and husbandry."
