12,Abstract:,"The Salmon River Estuary presents a unique opportunity for studying the process of marsh recovery. Three of four tidal marshes within the estuary were diked in the 1960s for cattle grazing purposes. The dikes were removed at nine year intervals beginning in 1978, allowing us to compare tidal marshes in different stages of recovery invertebrate fallout traps were placed at random sites within each marsh for a period of 72 hours. Samples were sorted by family in order to determine relative densities Insect diversity plays an integral role in the marsh food web, and will hopefully prove to be a reliable indicator of marsh recovery."
