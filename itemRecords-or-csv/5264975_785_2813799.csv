11,Abstract:,"In 1981, Sea Grant at Oregon State University produced the second in a series of documentary films about coastal issues and problems concerning citizens of the northwestern United States. This 28 minute film highlights the lower Columbia River-those last 26 miles of river where fresh water from the land and salt water from the sea merge. The estuary is an extremely productive environment and is essential to much of the fish and wildlife that inhabit the river and the north Pacific. Estuaries worldwide are being changed by human activities: the Columbia is no exception. But on the Columbia the world famous salmon resource hangs in the balance. What we do to the river and the estuary dramatically affects the salmon and the people who depend upon them. This film is both instructive and provocative. It addresses some tough questions. For example: why is the lower river so important to biological life and to the economy of the Northwest? What is happening to the estuary's biological productivity? What are the demands on the estuary? How does the use of water upriver affect the estuary and the salmon? What is being done to insure that our economic interests in the estuary do not destroy its ability to produce biologically?"
