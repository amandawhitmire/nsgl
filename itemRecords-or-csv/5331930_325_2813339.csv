10,Notes:,Report 6: The development of petroleum resources from the Outer Continental Shelf: Legal management problems and capabilities in Oregon
11,Abstract:,"This report is one of a series of reports to the Governor's Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and Gas Development Task Force on legal issues associated with the development of petroleum resources and associated facilities. Ports are unique political subdivisions in Oregon's government scheme: they are elected autorities with local navigation and private commercial development as their major focus. Because of this dual local commercial emphasis, ports are competitive among themselves, each trying to attract potential developers. Oregon ports which presently handle petroleum products and/or crude oil include Portland, St. Helens, Astoria, Newport, Umpqua and Coos Bay. This paper examines ports' potential to promote, influence and regulate activities and development associated with OCS petroleum resources, activities of regional, statewide and national significance."
