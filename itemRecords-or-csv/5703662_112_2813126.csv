12,Abstract:,"By reducing the amount of disposable and hazardous materials used in boating activities, reusing items whenever possible, and recycling, boaters can help protect waterways from pollution. This booklet expands on these 'three Rs,' guides boaters toward becoming better stewards of the marine environment, and informs them on compliance with the 1992 Clean Vessel Act and other marine pollution laws. It includes information about marine sanitation, hazardous chemicals, and wake and noise pollution. It also provides a map of pumpouts and dump stations in Oregon waters."
