10,Abstract:,"The expansion of the scope of fishery management from single species to ecosystems requires more than a set of rules for multiple species. It requires sets of institutions and property rights regimes that reflect the attributes of the ecosystem and its human users, value ecosystem services as well as ecosystem commodities, and coordinate interests groups and managers on a broad ecosystem scale. This paper identifies some of the important economic dimensions of resource management institutions that are embedded in both management structures and management processes. Close attention to these economic dimensions will be important to create compatibility between economic incentives and ecosystem objectives and to design a workable institutional environment for marine ecosystems."
