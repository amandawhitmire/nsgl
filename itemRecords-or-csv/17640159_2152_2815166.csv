14,Abstract:,"An exhibit informing viewers about the recent introduction to the U.S. West Coast of a non-native fish, the striped beakfish, by way of derelict fishing boats and other debris set adrift by the 2011 Japanese tsunami. This exhibit also includes information about the Japanese dock that washed ashore at Agate Beach in 2012 that was covered with more than 125 species of plants and animals. Some of the invasive species found on the dock are shown. This exhibit is on display at Oregon Sea Grant’s Visitor Center at Oregon State University’s Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, Oregon."
