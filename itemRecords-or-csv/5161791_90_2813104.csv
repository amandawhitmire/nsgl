11,Abstract:,"Various agencies in the State of Oregon which have the responsibility for managing the estuarine resources in the state, of course, have a continuing need for research information about these estuaries. Researchers for several of the concerned agencies began to feel an increased need for an organization which could provide a focal point to bring together the information that is available and to ultimately aid in coordinating future research efforts to maximize the information gained by such research on Oregon's estuaries. The Oregon Estuarine Research Council (OERC) was formed to achieve this objective and the first organizational meeting was held May 1, 1975. This compendium contains summaries of current research and management programs involving many aspects of Oregon' s estuarine environment and shoreline economy. Primary research interests included estuarine resources, aquaculture, diseases, education, marine advisory services, engineering, marine product development and others. The compendium will be circulated to OERC members agencies and other user groups in an effort to provide a concise review of current research projects which would otherwise be difficult to obtain."
