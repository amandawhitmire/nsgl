10,Abstract:,"South from the Otter Crest Lookout, the Oregon coastline spreads like a map. Small sandy coves nestle between rugged rocky headlands; Yaquina Head juts far to sea. This is the nearshore zone of the ocean; the open sea hides behind the horizon only 28 miles away. This nearshore zone is important to the Pacific Northwest. It is the site of important fisheries; it is a valuable tourist attraction; it is essential to the economy and ecology of the region."
