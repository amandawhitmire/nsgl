16,Abstract:,"This is one of six videos about how aquarists with Oregon Sea Grant care for animals at the Hatfield Marine Science Center's Visitor Center in Newport, Oregon. This video explains how the aquarists monitor the lighting, water flow, water chemistry and nutrition in tanks with corals to ensure that they grow into colorful colonies. Oregon Sea Grant operates the Visitor Center, which features interactive exhibits and attracts more than 150,000 visitors each year. It is home to Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program for K-12 students and teachers."
