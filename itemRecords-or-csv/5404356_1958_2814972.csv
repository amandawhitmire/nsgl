16,Abstract:,"Most of the major families of animal viruses are represented among the more than 50 fish viruses either isolated in cell culture or observed by electron microscopy. These viruses range in importance from orphan viruses to virulent pathogens causing large losses. We have compared certain morphological and biochemical features of four reo-like viruses isolated from fish and shellfish. The viruses should be included within the Reoviridae, but they are unlike members of the established genera. Because they have all been isolated from aquatic animal hosts, we tentatively refer to them as aquareoviruses."
