14,Abstract:,"Among the marine algae, the genus ""Laurencia"" produces the greatest diversity of secondary metabolites. The northeast Pacific species ""L. spectabilis"" was examined to determine if it contained eicosanoids similar to those found in the European species, ""L. spectabilis"", the major metabolite (16%) of this extract was a new and unrelated molecule which researchers named laurencione."
