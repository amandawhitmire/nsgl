11,Abstract:,"A varied and complex assemblage of fishes inhabit the coastal waters of Oregon. The variety of habitats, the ocean current patterns, and the geographical placement (42 to 46 deg. N) of this coast allow for visitation and colonization by northern and southern inshore fishes as well as those from the open ocean. This manual describes some of the most common kinds of fish found in this faunally rich area. Those fishes were selected because of their present or potential use as food or sport as well as their general interest to vacationers."
