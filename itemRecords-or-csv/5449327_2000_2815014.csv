12,Abstract:,"Presently, practically every maritime nation has made a claim to a Fisheries Conservation Zone or an Exclusive Economic Zone, among them a number of relatively new nations. For many of these countries, fisheries management and enforcement have become a new responsibility. This paper discusses this new environment and what it means for the development and management of U.S. fisheries resources, with particular reference to international trade. Specifically, two views are presented regarding extended jurisdiction which should be considered to understand policy positions on both international fishing and seafood trade issues."
