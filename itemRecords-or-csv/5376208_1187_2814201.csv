13,Abstract:,"High concentrations of heavy minerals occur in isolated placer deposits on modern beaches and in Pleistocene beach terraces of the Oregon coast. This study incorporates information about nearshore sand transport, regional variation in beach-sand composition, and mechanisms of selective mineral sorting to explain the distribution, geometry, and origin of beach placers on the coast. Results from this study can be used toward prediction of offshore placer deposits and to better understand the littoral transport processes along headland-â€‹bounded coastlines."
