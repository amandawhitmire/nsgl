13,Abstract:,"This publication is for the professional who works in a university, government agency, or nongovernmental organization and communicates with the public, mainly about scientific or technical information. Such professionals may be Extension agents, science writers, public educators, public information officers, organizational spokespersons, or even agency managers or research scientists ""just doing some outreach."" Regardless, a common goal of all such professionals is to cause at least some change in understanding through communication. In questioning common assumptions about communications, Hold that Thought! highlights contemporary research in the social sciences and the science of communication that can help make public communication more successful."
