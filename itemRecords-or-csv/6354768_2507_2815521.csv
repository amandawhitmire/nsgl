9,Abstract:,"Quests are fun and educational, clue-directed hunts that encourage outdoor exploration of natural areas. Questers follow the map in the book (there are 25 English and 1 Spanish Quest in this book) to located small boxes which contain stamps and more educational information about that site. The location of the clues and box remain a secret so others can share the fun, and are available year-round here in Lincoln, Coos, & Benton Counties, where the hunts all take place. Quests turn walks into treasure hunts, and it is also a great way to learn about these special natural places in our community."
