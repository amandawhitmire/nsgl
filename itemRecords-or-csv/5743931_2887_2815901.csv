12,Abstract:,Optimization programming techniques were applied to develop the least cost formulations for Pacific whiting surimi-based seafood (PWSBS). Results for representative target quality constraints are reported in this study and show that whey protein concentrate both increases the texture properties and remains economically competitive with other ingredients which similarly influence functionality in PWSBS.
