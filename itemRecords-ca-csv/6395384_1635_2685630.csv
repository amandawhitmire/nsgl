18,Abstract:,"In an unprecedented collaboration of 15 organizations who share an interest in the sustainable management and stewardship of the state’s coastal and marine resources, a survey was prepared. The results will inform their efforts to provide appropriate trainings and technical assistance to coastal professionals and to link them to the resources and tools that already exist. Nearly 600 coastal professionals along California’s open ocean, bay, delta, and estuarine coastlines, from a range of communities, regional, state and federal government agencies, as well as the civic and private sectors, were surveyed in the summer and fall of 2011 to understand: • Current coastal management challenges; • Concerns, knowledge, and actions to prepare for climate change impacts; and • Information, technical assistance, and training needs to support adaptation planning  and implementation. We would like to thank the 594 individuals who responded to this survey."
