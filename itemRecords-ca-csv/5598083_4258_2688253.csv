10,Abstract:,"Approximately 65% of catastrophic marine-related accidents (e.g. ""Exxon Valdez"" and ""Piper Alpha"") are the result of compounded human and organizational errors (HOE) during operations. Yet to date there is no structured quantitative approach to assist engineers, operators, and regulators of marine systems to design human and organizational error (HOE) tolerant systems. This report establishes (1) an organizational and classification framework for systematically identifying and characterizing the various types of marine-related human and organizational errors, and (2) uses case study examples to determine the effects of human and organizational errors in accident sequences. The taxonomy classifies human errors into individual, organizational, regulatory, and system contributors to accident scenarios."
