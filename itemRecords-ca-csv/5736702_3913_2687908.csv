9,Abstract:,"Coastal currents probably aren't something most of us will ever investigate in detail. However, the effect of this water flow touches nearly everyone, making knowledge about it a high priority. When it became obvious that oil spills and other pollutants on our beaches had affected our environment, attention turned to the science of coastal oceanography for understanding their transport. Some of this research is described."
