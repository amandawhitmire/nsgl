12,Abstract:,"Natural and man-made chemical contaminants enter the aquatic environment through industrial waste and water run-off. Microscopic plants in the water absorb the chemicals; small animals eat the contaminated plants, and fish eat the small animals. Large, flesh-eating fish contain larger amounts of contaminants than plant-eating fish because the contaminants are concentrated at each step in the food chain. Fish can also accumulate contaminants by contact with polluted water. The California EPA Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment determines if a health hazard may exist from eating sport-caught fish from certain locations. This determination results from laboratory testing programs. The guidelines assume long-term consumption and are for people who eat fish regularly. This fact sheet describes some common contaminants of California waters and where they are likely to be encountered. The same fact sheet may be ordered in Spanish (CUIMR-​G-​91-​010) instead of English."
