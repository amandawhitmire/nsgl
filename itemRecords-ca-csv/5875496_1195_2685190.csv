9,Abstract:,"""Vibrio cholerae"" is the causative agent of the severe dehydrating diarrheal disease cholera. This study examines the abundance and distribution of ""V. cholerae"" in recreational beach waters and tributaries of southern California. Water samples were taken form 11 beach locations adjacent to freshwater runoff sources, and also from rivers, creeks and coastal wetlands. Environmental parameters including temperature, salinity, coliphage counts, viable heterotrophic plate counts and total bacterial direct counts were also determined to understand the relationships between the presence of ""V. cholerae"" and environmental conditions."
