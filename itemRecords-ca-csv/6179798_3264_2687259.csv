12,Abstract:,"San Francisco Bay (SFB) harbor seal populations have remained stagnant or decreased slightly since the Marine Mammal Protection Act was passed in 1972, and has yet to reach maximum population capacity predicted for this region. Hypotheses as to why this population has not increased in this location include human disturbance, contaminants leading to lower reproduction rates through immunosuppresio​n and disease, and decreased survival rates or fecundity due to reduced prey availability or quality. Isotope analysis has been used extensively in ecological studies for decades, generally focusing on diet and trophic information. However, with the advent of gas chromatography-​combustion-​isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS), it is now possible to use the isotopic shifts in targeted biochemicals to explore nutritional state and dietary patterns. We are exploring a novel compound-​specific isotope approach (δ13C and δ15N on amino acids) to understand the nutritional and physiological states of marine mammals. We have used this method in a pilot project to test whether or not the isotopic patterns of amino acids in blood samples (SFB harbor seal population; Phoca vitulina) can be linked to nutritional stress due to lack of prey, changes in prey items, metabolic trauma from pollutants, or other factors. We first present isotope pattern data from 'healthier' seal populations in the Channel Islands and Tomales Bay, in order to investigate AA-isotope patterns as indicators of nutritional status and level of trophic feeding. We next compare these patterns to those from both SFB seals, as well as deceased and rehabilitating harbor seals (from the Marine Mammal Center) to explore extreme effects of catabolic vs. anabolic states. Bulk isotope analysis suggest differences among pups and yearlings (less than a year in age) vs. adult seals in SFB and Tomales Bay. Preliminary compound-​specific amino acid results also indicate potential dietary stress (low δ15N threonine and high glutamic acid) and lower trophic level feeding (2.5 vs. 3.0) in these younger populations."
