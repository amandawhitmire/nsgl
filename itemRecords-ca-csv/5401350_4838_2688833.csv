9,Abstract:,"Studies of the benthic community at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, revealed that the sponge ""Dendrilla membranosa"" was extremely slow growing and was never observed to be eaten. It was concluded that ""D. membranosa"", which has neither apparent spicules nor mucus, was chemically defended. Reported in this paper are the isolation and identification of 9,11-â€‹dihydrogracilin A (1) and membranolide (2), two metabolites related to the spongian group of diterpenes, that are likely candidates to be defensive constituents of ""D. membranosa""."
