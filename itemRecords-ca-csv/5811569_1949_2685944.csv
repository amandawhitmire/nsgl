11,Abstract:,"The focus of this paper is on estimating growth and mortality from size distributions that do not exhibit dominant age modes by including an auxiliary source of information, growth increments (the changes in sizes of individuals over a measured time period). The authors derive a method for estimating growth and natural and fishing mortality rates from size frequency and growth increment data, and evaluate the statistical characteristics of that method and its limitations. They then demonstrate the method using laboratory growth increments of the red sea urchin and northern California size frequency data from both unharvested and harvested sites."
