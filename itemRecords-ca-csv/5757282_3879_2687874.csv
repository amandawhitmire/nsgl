10,Abstract:,"The eyestalks of crabs were removed and various tissues of the limbs were autotransplante​d into the empty eye sockets to study the capacity of the limb tissue to regenerate in a heterotopic site. Autotransplanta​tion of walking leg tissues into the eye sockets was able to regenerate complete walking legs in the new site. Autotransplanta​tion of tissues of claw digit or more proximal claw segments could regenerate complete claws in the eye sockets. If the autotransplant of claw tissue was contralateral, claws could regenerate with host-site handedness. Results demonstrate that complete crab claws can regenerate from the eye sockets by autotransplanta​tion of live limb tissue and that the regeneration is not due to the traumatic effect of transplantation​. Tissue from distal portions of crab claw can regenerate proximal portions of the claw in the eye sockets. Such a mode of regeneration is not consistent with the distalization rule of the polar coordinate model, which proposes that distal portions of the limb cannot regenerate proximal portions and that the direction of limb regeneration is always from proximal to distal."
