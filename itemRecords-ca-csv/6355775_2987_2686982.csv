8,Abstract:,"Residual flow and exchange along a channel connecting an embayment with the coastal ocean are examined experimentally, using direct observations of currents and scalar concentrations across the mouth of San Francisco Bay. The study encompasses separate experiments during each of three ""seasons"": winter/spring runoff (March 2002) summer upwelling (July 2003), and fall relaxation (October 2002). Within each experiment, transects across the channel were repeated approximately every 12 minutes for 25 hours during both spring and neap tides. Velocity was measured from a boat-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler. Scalar concentrations were measured at the surface and from a tow-yard SeaSciences Inc. Acrobat."
