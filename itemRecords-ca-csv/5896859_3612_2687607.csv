15,Abstract:,"In this study, ultrasonic telemetry was used to examine the movement and thermal biology of six Pacific bluefin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The results from acoustic tags are compared to similar data obtained from pop-up satellite archival tags that tracked the movements of two bluefin for longer periods of time in the same region. The authors were also able to examine the temperature of the slow-oxidative muscle of three fish with respect to their depth movements and ambient temperature."
