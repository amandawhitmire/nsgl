10,Abstract:,"Mid to late summer mortalities among Pacific oysters, ""Crassostrea gigas"", have been reported since 1945 in Japan and intermittently from 1956 in oysters from the west coast of North America. Due to the inflammatory response invoked by the bacterium within oyster tissues, the condition has been called fatal inflammatory bacteremia (FIB). Here, methods to isolate the etiological agent of FIB were investigated in an effort to identify the bacterium and to determine whether a relationship exists between the pathogen and summer mortality of Pacific oysters."
