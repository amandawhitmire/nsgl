12,Abstract:,"Surface chlorophyll-""a"" concentrations and simultaneously collected multispectral scanner data from a U-2 aircraft over northern San Francisco Bay were used to develop regression models for predicting surface chlorophyll-""a"" concentrations. After selection of a single `best fitting' model the chlorophyll-""a"" concentration was predicted for ebb and flood tide for the entire study area. The spatial display revealed a localized area of high phytoplankton biomass that has been inferred from field surveys and appears to be a common summer phenomenon. Knowledge of the distribution of phytoplankton and the location of this zone of high biomass is valuable in establishing management policies for this ecologically important estuary. The techniques used here may provide an alternative cost-effective method for assessing water-quality conditions, patchiness, and seasonal variations in other estuaries and coastal waters."
