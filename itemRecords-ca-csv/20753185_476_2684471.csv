46,Abstract:,"This document is a companion to the ecosystem status report (ESR) provided by the California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment team (CCIEA) to the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) in March of 2017. The CCIEA team provides such reports annually, as one component of the overall CCIEA goal of providing quantitative, integrative science tools, products, and synthesis in support of ecosystem-based management of marine resources in the California Current. The indicators summarized in this report represent our best understanding of environmental, ecological, and socioeconomic conditions in the California Current Ecosystem approximately through 2016, though some time series are slightly more up-to-date and others slightly less so depending on the time required for data processing. The indicators have been codeveloped by the CCIEA team and the PFMC through an iterative process since the inception of the CCIEA project in 2009."
