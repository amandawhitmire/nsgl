11,Abstract:,"Estimates of size-specific mortality were made for red abalone, ""Haliotis rufescens,"" from mark-recapture data for three size classes at six sites in California. Instantaneous mortality for the smallest size class (</=100mm) was 0.67y-1 (0.52-0.84y-1, mean +/- S.E.) to 1.02y-1 (0.84-1.24y-1, (>178mm), 0.05y-1 0.0-0.14y-1, mean S.E.) to 1.35y-1 (1.17- 1.56y-1, mean +/- S.E.) in northern California and varied temporally in southern California, 0.27y-1 (0.15-0.42y-1, mean +/- S. E.) to 0.89y-1 (0.73-10.8y-1, mean +/- S.E.). Estimates of fishing mortality were 0.97y-1 (+/-0.21 S.E.) and 1.29y-1 (+/-0.17 S.E.) at two sites in northern California. Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of mortality estimates is critical for fishery management and conservation."
