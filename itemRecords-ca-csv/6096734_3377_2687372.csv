10,Abstract:,"environment, trade, tariffs, monitoring, invasive species"
11,,"International commodity trade serves as the primary conduit for unintentional introductions of damaging exotic species. We use a simple model of contaminated goods trade to analyze the optimal mix of tariffs and inspections as means of controlling damage from this negative externality. Among other policy relevant results, we find that (1) while it is always optimal to employ tariffs, there are non-trivial cases in which inspections should optimally be set to zero, (2) a higher infection rate requires a higher tariff, but beyond a point optimal inspections decrease in the infection rate, and finally (3) taking a dynamic view and considering future effects of current introductions leads unambiguously to more stringent inspections, but may give rise to higher or lower tariffs."
