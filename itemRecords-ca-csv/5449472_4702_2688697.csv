9,Abstract:,"During the early development of the national coastal zone management program there was no federal prescription with regard to how coastal states should proceed in establishing their programs. At one end of the spectrum was the California model--a new coastal `superagency' with power to both plan and regulate development. At the other end of the spectrum was an approach which relied on existing agencies and authorities and improved policy development and coordination; this approach was described as `networking'. Many viewed the networked model with skepticism. After more than a decade of experience, the efficacy of this approach to coastal management can be reviewed. Networked coastal management programs may provide important lessons for other regional land and water resources management efforts."
