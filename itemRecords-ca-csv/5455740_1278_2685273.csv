8,Abstract:,"The marine soft corals known as sea whips, sea fans, or sea plumes (also known as gorgonian corals) are conspicuous members of most tropical and subtropical marine habitats. Numerous studies of the natural product chemistry of gorgonian corals have been reported. This paper is a brief review of the diterpenoid chemistry of gorgonian corals of the genus ""Pseudopterogor​gia"". Previously described compounds and several new diterpenoids are presented in the context of their potential utilization in the development of anti-​inflammatory and analgesic drugs."
