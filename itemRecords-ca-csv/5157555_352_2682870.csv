13,Abstract:,"At very high Rayleigh numbers the fluid motion in bottom heated fluid layers becomes turbulent and the equations of motion become intractable without assumption concerning the form of the solution. The present model is offered in the hope of gaining qualitative insights on the nature of such flows. Its basic hypotheses are (a) the structure of the mean temperature field near the boundary and hence the heat transfer rate is dominated by the stagnation boundary layer associated iri.th the slow flow from the fluid interior, which are required by continuity to balance the fluid carried away in the thermals; and (b) the thickness of the stagnation boundary layer, and in turn the spacing and diameter of the thermals, are governed by stability considerations of the quasi-steady stagnation boundary layer. The latter hypothesis was based on the laboratory observations on the behavior of thermals. Semi-â€‹quantitative estimates of the critical Rayleigh number, based on comparison with related phenomena, yields Nusselt numbers which are in close agreement with experimental data. Procedure for quantitative evaluation of the model is also outlined."
