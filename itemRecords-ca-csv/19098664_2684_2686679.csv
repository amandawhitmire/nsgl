7,Abstract:,"Environmentally responsible. Lower carbon footprints due to fewer food miles and less processing; Some of the strictest regulations in the world on catch limits and habitat protections; Bolstered stewardship of the natural resources providing our food. Boosts our local economy. Imports are often cheap due to underpaid labor and a general lack of regulations overseas, and undervalued global transport. Buying local supports fair jobs all along our food supply chain. Although this may result in lower availability and higher prices of local products, we get consistently high marks for sustainability and quality. Just, healthy and safe food. Locally sourced means fresher product, and we have some of the strictest health and safety regulations in the world ensuring the security of fresh, healthy seafood for our community and of the people who bring it to us. Coastal identity. Buying local and direct strengthens relationships between San Diego’s long line of seafood harvesters and our proud coastal community, which sustains our historic coastal heritage, highlights our identity, and heightens our culinary uniqueness."
