13,Abstract:,"The annual economic value of California's boating industry exceeds six billion dollars. Eighty-five percent of the state's boating related businesses are in the coastal counties. Their productivity is tied to the availability of coastal ports, harbors, and marinas. Their managers need the latest technical and management information to operate at peak efficiency. Previous studies of these facilities have produced inventories and economic impact analyses. No data were available on the specific information needs of coastal waterfront managers. In 1986, 206 California coastal waterfront managers were surveyed. Objectives were to identify operating circumstances, technical and management information needs, and how best to 'deliver information. Fifty percent responded."
