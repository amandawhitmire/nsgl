11,Abstract:,"Studies suggest that newly constructed salt marshes are not functionally equivalent to natural salt marshes and that functional equivalency may not be obtained for many years or decades. Researchers hypothesized that plant growth and the development of sediment organic matter and nitrogen pools could be accelerated by augmenting soils with organic matter or nitrogen, and tested this hypothesis in a newly constructed intertidal salt marsh in southern California. Amending soils prior to transplantation did not achieve the goal of functional equivalency with natural marshes, and after 2 yr there was no indication that nutrient pools or plant growth rates would achieve natural levels."
