10,Abstract:,"Phenolic compounds are found in coastal marine environments. They may be naturally produced by marine organisms or enter the ocean from anthropogenic sources. Due to a paucity of knowledge concerning degradation of phenols in marine environments, the present study was undertaken. The goal was to determine the rate(s) of biodegradation of phenols at low concentrations by natural marine microbial populations collected from a coastal site off Southern California."
