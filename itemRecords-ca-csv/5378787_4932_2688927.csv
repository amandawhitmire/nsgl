9,Abstract:,"A cooperative project between the Marine Advisory Program and NMFS was developed to conduct exploratory fishing for coonstripe shrimp and, as time and weather allowed, spot prawns along the Humboldt County coastline. Commercial quantities were not found for either species. Furthermore, continued directed searches are not recommended because of the expense involved."
