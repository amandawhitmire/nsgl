9,Abstract:,"Nitrogen effects were examined by experimentally enriching plots of pure ""Spartina foliosa"" and mixed ""Spartina/Salicâ€‹ornia virginica"" at Tijuana Estuary, California. Even with large inputs of organic nitrogen from sewage spills in 1983, plants responded to experimental urea enrichment. In mixed plots, enrichment had no apparent effect on ""Spartina"" but increased the growth of ""Salicornia"". The experimental removal of ""Salicornia"" from mixed stands increased ""Spartina"" production, but removal of ""Spartina"" did not affect ""Salicornia"". ""Salicornia"" is a superior competitor for nitrogen and checks the growth of ""Spartina"" even in enriched conditions."
