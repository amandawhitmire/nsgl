9,Abstract:,"In recent years, California's commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) fleet has experienced economic decline. Many of the fish species targeted by California's CPFVs are not always available due to changes in abundance, migratory patterns, or poor weather on the fishing grounds. By contrast, nontarget species, such as Pacific mackerel, are caught in significant numbers but are generally discarded, wasted, or ignored as inferior and undesirable. These problems can be attacked by developing educational programs and marketing strategies based on an understanding of the demographic characteristics​, motivations, preferences, and sources of satisfaction of California's anglers."
