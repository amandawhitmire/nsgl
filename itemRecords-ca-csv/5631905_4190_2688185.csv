11,Abstract:,"It appears that the endocrine regulation of crustacean molting is more complex than initially thought. Both stimulatory and inhibitory activities are likely involved. Simple manipulations, such as eyestalk removal, can have dramatic effects on lobster growth; the potential for improving growth efficiency is obviously present. However, much more work needs to be conducted on elucidating the complexities of the endocrine control of molting before routine hormonal manipulations can be conducted."
