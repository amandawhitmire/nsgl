11,Abstract:,"The objective of this paper is to examine one aspect of uncertainty in estuarine systems, the effect of parameter uncertainty on the prediction of water levels and flow rates. A new approach involving quasilinearizat​ion and perturbation analysis is used to approximate the solution of the random differential hydraulic equation. Explicit solutions are developed for the mean and variance of the water levels for any spatial location in the estuarine system. Monte Carlo methods were used to analyze the effects of parameter uncertainty and to provide a cross check on the validity of the quasi-​analytical solutions. Analysis is based on the solution of the one-​dimensional, steady, spatially-​varied estuarine flow equation. The application of the open-channel flow equation will not illustrate a practical application of the uncertainty analysis; however, the approach will demonstrate the problems encountered in the interpretation and application of random differential equations in estuarine modeling."
