10,Abstract:,"This article reviews the expression patterns of two structural genes, a larval chymotrypsin gene and a muscle- specific tropomyosin gene, in relation to larval development, competence and metamorphosis. The patterns of developmental regulation of these genes suggest there are at least two distinct pathways controlling gene expression leading to metamorphosis in ""Haliotis."""
