9,Abstract:,"Commercial landings of California market squid (Loligo opalescens) vary highly with oceanic conditions. An extreme example is seen with what happened during the 1996-97 La Nina and 1997-98 El Nino. In 1996-97, a record 110,000 tons were landed; the next year, during El Ni�o, landings plummeted to less than 1,000 tons. Biologists believe these huge fluctuations are tied to changes in the availability of krill, the main diet of squid. The krill population, in turn, is linked to changes in primary productivity, caused by changes in wind patterns off the coast."
