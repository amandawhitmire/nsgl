20,Abstract:,"Our Deep Biosphere project (funded by NSF-Microbial Observatory) is designed to exploit the unprecedented opportunities provided by the new generation of long-term borehole-CORK observatories (advanced CORKs) installed on the flanks of the Juan de Fuca Ridge (JdFR) by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), to study the microbial geochemistry and ecology of the sediment-buried ocean basement. We will present a description of the new CORK's attributes with respect to deep biosphere studies, and the instrumentation sleds and associated equipment that we have built in support of these studies. The instrumentation sleds (e.g., the GeoMICROBE sled) allow for ""in situ"" (i.e., at the seafloor) geochemical analyses (e.g., electrochemistr​y) of the 30-65oC fluids that circulate within the sediment-buried basement., as well as the in situ filtration of fluids for ship and shore-based molecular biological, culture, biomass and geochemical procedures. We will also present the challenges, solutions and preliminary results of our recent (August 2008) Atlantis/Alvin cruise to the JdFR flank CORKs."
