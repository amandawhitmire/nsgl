10,Abstract:,"Eight new compounds were isolated from a Western Australian sponge ""Spongia"" sp., including 12-​hydroxyambliofu​ran (5), its acetate ester 6, five new tetracyclic diterpenes 7 - 11 and the epoxyfuranosest​erterpene carboxylic acid 12. Compounds 5 and 6, each isolated as a 3:1 mixture of enantiomers as determined by a modified Mosher's ester method and chiral lanthanide NMR shift studies, are rare examples of scalemic marine natural products."
