13,Abstract:,"Because tunicates rely on innate immunity, their hemocytes are important contributors to host defense. ""Styela clava"", a solitary ascidian, have eight hemocyte subtypes. Extracts of their total hemocyte population contained multiple small antimicrobial peptides. When purified, these fell into two distinct families that were named styelins and clavanins. Styelins A-E are phenylalanine-​rich, 32-residue peptides with activity against marine bacteria and human pathogens. Clavanins A-E are histidine-rich, 23-residue peptides that are C-terminally amidated and most effective at acidic pH. Clavaspirin is a newly described family member that also has potent cytotoxic properties. Transmission and scanning electron micrographs of methicillin-​resistant ""Staphylococcus aureus"" and ""E. coli"" that had been treated with Styelin D and clavaspirin suggested that both peptides induced osmotic disregulation. Treated bacteria manifested cytoplasmic swelling and extrusion of cytoplasmic contents through their peptidoglycan cell wall. The diverse array of antimicrobial peptides in ""S. clava"" hemocytes constitutes an effective host defense mechanism of possible medical application."
