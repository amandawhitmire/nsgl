10,Abstract:,"This historical perspective on the Reagan twelve-mile territorial sea proclamation concentrates not upon federal-state relationships in territorial sea development but rather upon separation-​of-​powers issues at the center itself. The conflicting claims of the executive and the legislative branch have comprised a fairly continuous history of tensions in this area of law for more than half a century. The purpose here is to examine the changing positions of Congress and the President with respect to offshore jurisdiction; including the major debates over all forms of control over coastal waters, within and beyond the territorial sea, as those questions have been debated in an elaborate interrelationsh​ip with the narrower questions of law and policy regarding the geographical limits and jurisdictional implications of the territorial sea."
