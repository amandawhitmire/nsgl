11,Abstract:,"Artificial hard substrates have been used to stabilize naturally soft buy shorelines for centuries, but little attention has been paid to the communities inhabiting armored shorelines and to the ecological implications of armoring. The goal of this study was to examine factors affecting spatial and temporal variation of intertidal, hard-substrate biota (emergent species and fishes), with emphasis on the influence of exposure, distance from the open ocean, and similarity to open-coast, hard-substrate communities. For this research the authors examined community composition at eight San Diego Bay sites (an exposed and a protected site at four locations) in June and November 2000 and two open-coast sites in August 2000."
