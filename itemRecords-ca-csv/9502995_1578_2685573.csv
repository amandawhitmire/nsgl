8,Abstract:,"Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, and Toxoplasma gondii are waterborne protozoalpathog​ens distributed worldwide and empirical evidence suggests that wetlands reduce theconcentratio​ns of these pathogens under certain environmental conditions. The goal of this study wasto evaluate how protozoal removal in surface water is affected by the water temperature, turbidity,salin​ity, and vegetation cover of wetlands in the Monterey Bay region of California. To examine howprotozoal removal was affected by these environmental factors, we conducted observationalex​periments at three primary spatial scales: settling columns, re-circulating wetland mesocosm tanks,and an experimental research wetland (Molera Wetland). Simultaneously, we developed a protozoaltransp​ort model for surface water to simulate the settling columns, the mesocosm tanks, and theMolera Wetland. With a high degree of uncertainty expected in the model predictions and fieldobservatio​ns, we developed the model within a Bayesian statistical framework. We found protozoalremova​l increased when water flowed through vegetation, and with higher levels of turbidity, salinity,and temperature. Protozoal removal in surface water was maximized (~0.1 hr-1) when flowing throughemergent vegetation at 2% cover, and with a vegetation contact time of ~ 30 minutes compared to theeffects of temperature, salinity, and turbidity. Our studies revealed that an increase in vegetatedwetlan​d area, with water moving through vegetation, would likely improve regional water qualitythrough the reduction of fecal protozoal pathogen loads."
