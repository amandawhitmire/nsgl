9,Abstract:,"Juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) emigrating from natal tributaries of the Sacramento River may use a number of possible migration routes to negotiate the Sacramento?San Joaquin River Delta (hereafter, ?the Delta?), each of which may influence their probability of surviving. In a previous report, we developed and applied a mark-recapture model to data from acoustically tagged juvenile late-fall Chinook salmon that migrated through the Delta during the winter of 2007. This study was repeated during the winter of 2008, and this report presents findings from our second year of research. First, population-​level survival through the Delta (SDelta) during 2008 was substantially lower than in 2007, and we found little difference in SDelta between releases. For releases in December 2007, was 0.174 (=0.031) and for January 2008, was 0.195 (= 0.034), compared to 0.351 and 0.543 for the same release groups in 2007. In contrast to our previous study, we found that the fraction of the population entering the interior Delta was similar between releases (26.7% for December, 31.1% for January), despite the Delta Cross Channel being open during December and closed during January. However, similar to previous findings, survival of fish migrating through the interior Delta was significantly less than survival probabilities for fish remaining in the Sacramento River. The ratio of survival for fish migrating through the interior Delta relative to the Sacramento River was ≤35.2% (≤0.11) during both releases. Thus, migration routes through the interior Delta reduced population-​level survival by a similar magnitude during both releases because differences in survival between routes remained constant, as did the fraction of fish entering the interior Delta. Reach-specific survival rates in the Sacramento River (expressed as a function of reach length) were higher than reaches within other migration routes. These findings indicated that variation in route-specific survival was driven by consistent differences among migration routes, rather than by specific reaches within a route. Our studies during 2006 and 2007 highlight the variation in survival and migration route probabilities that can be expected in future research, but nonetheless, consistent patterns in route-specific survival and migration are beginning to emerge."
