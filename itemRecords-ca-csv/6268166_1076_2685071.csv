11,Abstract:,"Determining the appropriate design template is critical to coastal wetland restoration. In seasonally wet and semi-arid regions of the world coastal wetlands tend to close off from the sea seasonally or episodically, and decisions regarding estuarine mouth closure have far reaching implications for cost, management, and ultimate success of coastal wetland restoration. In the past restoration planners relied on an incomplete understanding of the factors that influence estuarine mouth closure. Consequently, templates from other climatic/physio​graphic regions are often inappropriately applied. The first step to addressing this issue is to develop a classification system based on an understanding of the processes that formed the estuaries and thus define their pre-development structure. Here we propose a new classification system for California estuaries based on the geomorphic history and the dominant physical processes that govern the formation of the estuary space or volume within them. The classification system uses geologic origin, exposure to littoral process, and watershed size and runoff characteristics as the basis of a conceptual model that predicts likely frequency and duration of closure of the estuary mouth. We then begin to validate the proposed model by investigating historical documentation of three representative estuaries to determine if their pre-development condition was consistent with the structure predicted by the classification. In application of the model, eight closure states, based on elevation of barriers to tidal access, were defined. These states can be determined from historic, maps descriptions and photography. These states are then used to validate models of closure state frequency for different classes of estuaries based on the classification. Application of the classification model suggests that under natural conditions, the vast majority of California estuaries experience some degree of closure, and most spend a preponderance of time in the closed condition. In this state, stream flow rather than tidal influence is the most critical variable controlling mouth opening. Individual estuaries exist in a variety of closure states over multiyear to multi-decadal time frames. An estuary may exist in a given closure state for periods of time ranging from days to years. The distribution of closure states for an estuary over time can be used to guide management decisions based on dominant closure and hydrodynamics of the system. Success of future estuarine restoration projects could be improved by incorporating consideration of mouth closure dynamics."
