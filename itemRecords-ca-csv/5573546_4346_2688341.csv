10,Abstract:,"Alkaloids having the 1,3,4,5-​tetrahydropyrro​lo[4,3,2-​""de""]quinoline skeleton are uncommon in nature. In the marine environment, they have only been reported from a deep water Caribbean sponge of the genus ""Batzella"", which contained batzellines and isobatzellines. The structure of damirones A and B, two new pyrroloquinolin​e pigments from the Palauan sponge ""Damiria"" sp., were determined by comparison of their spectral data with those of the batzellines."
