12,Abstract:,"Gas chromatographic analyses of the methyl esters of the fatty acids from stored and non-stored menhaden FPC samples (lot numbers 67-301, 68-402, and 69-404) are shown in Tables I and II. The 1971 third quarterly and annual reports included some preliminary data. Storage caused major decreases in the percentages of C20:5 and C22:6 fatty acids and corresponding apparent increases in the percentages of the lower molecular weight fatty acids."
