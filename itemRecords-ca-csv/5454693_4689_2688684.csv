11,Abstract:,"Confusion in the taxonomy of economically important tropical and subtropical algae remains the single greatest obstacle to progress in Pacific seaweed aquaculture and marine natural products chemistry. In this richly illustrated volume, the second in a series, an international group of specialists representing the United States, Japan, China, Chile, and Taiwan describe the results of a workshop on the taxonomy of the groups ""Gracilaria, Polycavernosa, Eucheuma, Sargassum, Laurencia,"" and the Gelidiales. The workshop, co-sponsored by the California Sea Grant College Program and the Academia Sinica of the People's Republic of China, was held in Qingdao in September 1986. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. Japanese and Taiwanese species of ""Sargassum"" subgenus ""Sargassum"". Tadao Yoshida pp. 5-21. 2. Studies on Chinese species of Zygocarpic ""Sargassum"". Tseng C. K. and Lu Baoren pp. 23-54. 3. Clarification of some subgeneric nomenclature in ""Sargassum"" subgenus ""Sargassum"". Isabella A.
