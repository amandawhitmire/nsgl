10,Abstract:,"The third known species of Brotula from the Indo-Pacific, B. flaviviridis sp. nov., is described from Fiji. Brotula townsendi is an antiequitorial species, known from the Hawaiian Islands, Johnston Island, and the Marshall Islands in the northern hemisphere, and Chesterfield Islands, New Caledonia, Loyalty Islands, Vanuatu, and Tonga in the southern hemisphere. Brotula multibarbata is widespread in the Indo- Pacific. Brotula flaviviridis differs from both in coloration, being yellow-green. It is similar to B. townsendi in having an eye that is narrower than the fleshy interorbital width, whereas B. multibarbata has an eye that is wider. It differs from B. townsendi by having a smaller eye and narrower interorbital width. While conducting a survey of the marine fishes of Fiji, two specimens of a yellow-green brotula were collected using rotenone at the barrier reef on the north side of Kanacea Island in the Northern Lau Group, Fiji. The fresh coloration of these specimens was distinctly different from the other two species in the genus Brotula known from the Indo-Pacific. The new species is placed in the genus Brotula because: the anterior nostril is well above the upper lip, near the eye; the supramaxilla is present; the dorsal-fin rays are equal to or longer than opposing anal-fin rays; and six barbels are present on the snout and six on the chin. Only five species in the genus Brotula are currently considered to be valid. Brotula barbata (Bloch in Bloch and Schneider, 1801) occurs in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean. Brotula clarkae Hubbs (1944) occurs in the tropical eastern Pacific from the Gulf of California to Peru, and B. ordwayi Hildebrand and Barton (1949) occurs at Peru and the Gal�pagos Islands. In the Indo- Pacific Ocean, B. townsendi Fowler (1900) is known from the Hawaiian Islands, Johnston Island, Marshall Islands, Chesterfield Islands, New Caledonia, Loyalty Islands, Vanuatu, and Tonga, and B. multibarbata Temminck and Schlegel (1846) is widespread. Hubbs (1944) listed ten other described species as synonyms of B. multibarbata, and these were also listed by Nielsen, et al. (1999)."
