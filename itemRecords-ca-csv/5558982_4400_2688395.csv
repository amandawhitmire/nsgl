10,Abstract:,"Ecdysteroids (Ecds) are steroid hormones which are found in all arthropods thus far examined. Regulation or molting by Ecds in crustaceans has been a subject of study for more than 20 years. Hemolymph titers of Ecds are generally low during postmolt and intermolt, rise to a large peak, and rapidly fall just prior to ecdysis. In addition to the type and rate of metabolism, excretion may also be an important variable in the overall regulation of Ecd levels. This paper reports the titers and types of Ecd metabolites in urine and feces and correlates these to the previous hemolymph data."
