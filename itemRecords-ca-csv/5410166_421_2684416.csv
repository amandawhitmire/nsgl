13,Abstract:,"The rockfish species complex comprises numerous species of scorpaenid fishes in the genera ""Sebastes"" and ""Sebastolobes""; rockfishes are an important part of North Pacific, and North Atlantic marine resources, with catches ranking at the top of domestic bottomfish landings. On the Pacific Coast significant rockfish resources have been depleted and are now at population levels far below their productive optima. The history of rockfish fisheries suggests that managing such resources is not easy, and that detailed information on stock sizes and biological characteristics of the species are required. Although the Pacific Ocean perch attracted early attention, the basic biological information on the various species and assessments of stock sizes and conditions have historically been sketchy, at least until the last decade. With passage of the U.S. Fisheries and Conservation Management Act in 1976, the picture began to change. This symposium is a vehicle for updating and summarizing current information and for pointing the direction for future studies. The following papers are included in this proceedings: 1.
