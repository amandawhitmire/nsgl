10,Abstract:,"Species of the nemertean genus ""Carcinonemerte​s"" are egg predators that may cause substantial brood mortality on their decapod crustacean hosts. The yellow rock crab, ""Cancer anthonyi,"" is a commercially harvested crab that is abundant at nearshore depths in the Santa Barbara Channel, California. This study examined a lightly infested population of these commercially harvested crabs, and compared the dynamics of infestation with infestations on other crab species. ""C. epialti"" had a minimal impact on the egg mortality of this population, even though ""Cancer anthonyi"" was virtually always infested with ""C. epialti"" and is the most important host for the worm in this area."
