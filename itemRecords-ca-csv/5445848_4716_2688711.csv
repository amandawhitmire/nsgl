9,Abstract:,"This study compares the effects of four experimentally produced conditions of reproduction and nonreproduction upon molting and growth. The effects of the uncontrolled adjunct variables of female size, temperature, presence of the clutch, and prior reproductive history are also reported. A uniform terminology with which to discuss the complicated relationships between molt, long-day photoperiod onset, and egg extrusion is introduced and the implications of these relationships for lobster natural history are discussed."
