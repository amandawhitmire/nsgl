10,Abstract:,"The value of sturgeon flesh and the demand for caviar makes the culture of sturgeon an exciting opportunity for aquaculture worldwide. However, a major problem in successfully adapting sturgeon to aquaculture has been the failure to produce mature domestic broodstock for egg and milt production, in even the industrial-â€‹scale sturgeon hatcheries in the U.S.S.R. Females raised in culture remain reproductively immature until at least 10 years of age (the age of the oldest cultured females in California); reproduction in these females is arrested just prior to the initiation of vitellogenesis. Observations of the reproductive maturation of captive sturgeon broodstock and previous efforts to manipulate their endocrine system are reviewed. While researchers have been successful in inducing vitellogenesis in these immature cultured females by estradiol administration, the ovarian follicles will not incorporate the vitellogenin."
