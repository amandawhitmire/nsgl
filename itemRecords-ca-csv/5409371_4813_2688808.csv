8,Abstract:,"In recent years, there has been discussion about catch per unit effort, CPUE, of the form CPUE=ANP where N is abundance and p1. In this paper it is first shown that, if one ignores stock depletion, then CPUE can be independent of abundance, proportional to abundance or of the approximate form ANP with p1. The same is true when depletion of the stock is considered. A method for determining the regime (CPUE independent of abundance, proportional to abundance, or of the form ANP) based on search time data is presented."
