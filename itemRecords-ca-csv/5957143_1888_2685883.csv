10,Abstract:,"In southern California, native eelgrass ""Zostera marina"" and the invasive nonnative mussel ""Musculista senhousia"" have dynamic complex interactions. Previous observations have suggested that the mussels, which feed on phytoplankton delivered by water currents, might suffer food limitation inside large eelgrass beds. By supplementing phytoplankton to ""M. senhousia"" living in eelgrass, the authors of this study confirmed this hypothesis: mussels grew 50 percent faster when food availability was enhanced. Lab and field experiments showed that mussels responded to food limitation by reducing shell growth, and subsequently fecundity. These results highlight how the effects of anthropogenic perturbations that currently threaten eelgrass populations directly could be magnified by interactions with a nonnative species. Increasingly frequent phytoplankton blooms are already known to have direct negative effects on eelgrass beds; when available to ""M. senhousia"", phytoplankton may play a further negative role in eelgrass beds by enhancing mussel survival."
