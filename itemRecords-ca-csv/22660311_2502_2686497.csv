10,Abstract:,"Over 90% of historical tidal wetlands in the San Francisco Estuary have been lost, primarily to filling for agriculture, industry and urban development. A special subset of these wetlands were diked in the early 1900s and have been managed for waterfowl since. These are largely concentrated in the Suisun Marsh, where over 150 privately owned and managed duck clubs and a handful of public lands now preserve, maintain and enhance these historical wetlands.That's about 60,000 acres of wetland habitat-over 10% of all remaining non-​agricultural wetlands in California-that have been safeguarded from development for over a century. But it hasn't been easy fo these dedicated hunters to remain the stewards of the land for all this time. Regulatory hurdles such as water quality standards and concerns over endangered species have complicated wetland management in the Suisun Marsh, and hunters have come under fire for maintaining wetlands behind levees during a time when many entities are seeking to perform as much tidal restoration as possible in anticipation of sea level rise."
