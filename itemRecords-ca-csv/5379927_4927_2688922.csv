10,Abstract:,"The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate phylogenetic relationships of ""Artedius, Clinocottus"", and ""Oligocottus"" within the Cottidae following the phylogenetic methodology of Hennig (1966) and (2) to describe the ontogeny of larvae and juveniles of as many species of ""Artedius, Clinocottus"", and ""Oligocottus"" as possible. Much of the confusion in the systematic treatment of these genera is due to the use of primitive and reductive characters in classifications​, and the failure of past workers to define the genera on the basis of unique, derived characters. Characters used in past studies have not been exclusive to this group and are present in other cottid genera."
