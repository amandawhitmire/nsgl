11,Abstract:,"The horseshoe crab serves as a unique model for studying the lipid chemistry of invertebrate blood cells. The authors report the phospholipid composition of the crab's granular amebocyte. The total fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/​mass spectrometry fatty acid methyl esters. Phospholipids were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The major phospholipid species were collected and their molecular species were examined by electrosprayion​ization mass spectrometry. The presence of 16:0""e""/20:4 is the first documentation of a specific precursor to platelet-​activating factor in an invertebrate hemocyte."
