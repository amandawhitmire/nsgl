11,Abstract:,"This article reviews the management of the sea urchin fishery, with emphasis on North America and a quantitative focus on the population dynamic basis for management decisions. The authors assess the various approaches to management in the context of biological reference points as used in the precautionary approach to fisheries management. The precautionary approach includes a number of devices for addressing and reducing the effects of uncertainty. One of these is the definition of reference points: a target reference point and a limit reference point. It also calls for special caution in the case of developing fisheries, a call that has not been heeded in the recent rapid development of sea urchin fisheries."
