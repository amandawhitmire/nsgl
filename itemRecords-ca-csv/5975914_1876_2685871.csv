10,Abstract:,"Researchers investigated the fate of fragments of the invasive seaweed ""Caulerpa taxifolia"" from southern California after exposure to chlorine or temperature shock (hot or cold). The objectives were (1) to determine how much bleach is necessary to kill fragments of ""C. taxifolia"" under different temperatures, and (2) to provide recommendations on the field eradication treatment protocol and development of quarantine facilities for future research. Results suggest that chlorine concentrations in eradication treatments should be maintained at 125 ppm for at least 30 min in both the water column and in the sediments to reach stolons and rhizoids. Fragments of ""C. taxifolia"" are unlikely to survive or grow at ambient temperatures (8 to 10 degrees Celsius) off the open coast of northern California. Heating the effluent from research and public aquaria quarantine systems might be prudent."
