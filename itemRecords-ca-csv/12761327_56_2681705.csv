14,Abstract:,"This website provides information and resources about alternative marketing (often referred to as direct marketing) for seafood. The authors have distilled information from diverse, readily available sources and from interviews they conducted with commercial fishermen, buyers, and others in fishing communities on both the east and west coasts. The website provides documents, website links, and contact information for various agencies relevant to seafood marketing. While this website is geared primarily toward U.S. west coast fishermen and communities, much of it is applicable to those in other regions who are interested in establishing or expanding alternative markets for seafood. This website was developed as part of a research project entitled, “Toward resilience and sustainable seafood supply: Assessing direct marketing programs for west coast fishing communities,” funded by the National Sea Grant Social Science Research Initiative, through California Sea Grant Project No. NA2233-C, NOAA Grant No. NA10OAR4170060, R/SOC-02 and Oregon Sea Grant Project NOAA Grant No. NA10OAR4170059, NB223B. Additional support was provided by the: California Sea Grant Extension Program; Oregon Sea Grant Extension Program; Marine Science Institute, University of California Santa Barbara; and Institute of Marine Sciences, University of California Santa Cruz."
