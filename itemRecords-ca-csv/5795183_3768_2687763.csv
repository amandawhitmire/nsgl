10,Abstract:,"The bacterium ""Shewanella putrefaciens"" is capable of using a wide variety of inorganic and organic compounds as a terminal electron acceptor, and is one of very few bacteria known to be capable of direct dissimilatory reduction of iron (III). Previously classified variously as ""Pseudomonas"" sp. Strain 200, ""P. ferrireductans""â€‹, and ""Alteromonas putrefaciens"", and finally assigned to the newly-created genus ""Shewanella"", this bacterium was originally isolated from an oil pipeline. Siderophore production in a large number of ""S. putrefaciens"" strains from sources has been surveyed. This paper reports the structure of putrebactin, a novel cyclic dihydroxamate siderophore produced by ""S. putrefaciens"". Putrebactin is similar in structure to two other siderophores, bisucaberin and alcaligin, produced by unrelated bacteria."
