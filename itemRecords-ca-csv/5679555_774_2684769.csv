11,Abstract:,"Abalones are members of a large class (Gastropods) of molluscs having one-piece shells. They belong to the genus ""Haliotis"", which means sea ear, referring to the flattened shape of the shell. Nine species of abalone occur in North America, all but one along the Pacific coast. Six species (all Pacific) are harvested commercially; however, all stocks have declined dramatically. Conservation efforts have begun, but even these are threatened by the burgeoning sea otter population in California. Each species is briefly described here, along with ranges, production and seafood products and markets."
