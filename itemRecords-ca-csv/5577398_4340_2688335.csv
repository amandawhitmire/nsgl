11,Abstract:,"The development and maintenance of geographic races within a given species depend on the strength of local selective pressures and, secondarily, on the degree of reproductive isolation. The goal of this study was to examine three geographically isolated populations of the giant kelp, ""Macrocystis pyrifera"", for evidence of a genetic basis for differences in their response to nitrate availability. Juvenile sporophytes were raised in the laboratory from spores and were examined for differences in the effect of nutrient availability on growth and nitrogen content."
