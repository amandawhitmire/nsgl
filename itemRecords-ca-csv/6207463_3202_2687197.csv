14,Abstract:,"Vibrioferrin (VF) is a member of the carboxylate class of siderophores originally isolated from Vibrio parahaemolyticu​s, an enteropathogeni​c estuarine bacterium often associated with seafood-borne gastroenteritis​. Recently we have also isolated this siderophore from several species of Marinobacter, which are closely associated or ""symbiotic"" with toxic, bloom-forming dinoflagellates such as Gymnodinium catenatum.We have measured the overall metal-ligand binding constant for iron-​vibrioferrin (FeVF) as 1024.02(5) making vibrioferrin one of the weakest iron chelators of any known marine siderophore. FeVF is also shown to be considerably more sensitive to photolysis under relatively low illumination conditions than other photoactive siderophores leading primarily to a monodecarboxyla​ted photoproduct that has no significant affinity for Fe(III). The consequences that these features have on bacterial-algal interactions with potential importance to understanding the origin and sustenance of harmful algal blooms are discussed."
