10,Abstract:,"Using cohort analysis and matrix population modeling, the authors examined the relative influence of pre- versus post-â€‹recruitment life-history events on population size of a temperate intertidal fish, ""Clinocottus analis."" The goal was to determine which life-history stage was most responsible for temporal changes in population size from 1996 to 2000 at 2 sites in San Diego, California, both seasonally and during the 1997-98 El Nino Southern Oscillation."
