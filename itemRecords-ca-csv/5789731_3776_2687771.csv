16,Abstract:,"The present study examines the effects of homologous growth hormone (GH) and two forms of prolactin (PRI) on hypoosmoregulat​ory ability and gill Na, K-ATPase activity in hypophysectomiz​ed tilapia. The experiments were conducted to test the possibility that GH might show a seawater-​adapting action in an evolutionarily advanced fish, as occurs in salmonids, and to analyze whether the two PRL variants differ in their osmoregulatory functions."
