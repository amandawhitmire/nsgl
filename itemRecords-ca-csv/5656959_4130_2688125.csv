10,Abstract:,"More than 80% of major marine accidents are caused not by systems failures but by human and organizational error (HOE). This paper presents a formal method for analyzing, predicting, and limiting the effects of human error. It should also provide the basis for developing reporting systems for future marine accidents. An industry-wide database, incorporating information on both accidents and 'near misses' should be developed. The results obtained in this project are intended to be used by engineers, operators, managers, and regulators concerned with preventing and mitigating the effects of HOE, and thus with increasing the safety of marine systems."
