9,Abstract:,"The significance of Morro Bay has been recognized by its designation as a State Estuary and one of 28 National Estuaries. As directed by these programs, the Morro Bay Watershed Council is guiding the development of a management plan that will address water quality related issues. The Council has established several issues and suggest solutions to them. The goal of this workshop was to develop specific ideas for research needs, cooperators and funding sources. This document incorporates the results of those discussions, as well as comments received from subsequent reviews."
