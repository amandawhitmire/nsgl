10,Abstract:,"We conducted these fishing surveys to characterize fish populations inside and outside of new marine protected areas (MPAs) in central California. MPAs function in the ocean in much the same way that state and national parks do on land- as refuges that protect diverse habitats and wildlife within their borders from the impacts of human activity. As part of the Marine Life Protection Act of 1999, California is currently implementing a network of MPAs to span its entire coast. The first section of this network was established in 2007 in the Monterey region of California, from Pigeon Point to Point Conception."
