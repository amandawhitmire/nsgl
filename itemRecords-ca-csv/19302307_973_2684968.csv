15,Abstract:,"The invasive water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) severely limits the ecosystem services provided by the Sacramento-​San Joaquin River Delta in California, USA. As part of the biological control program in the Delta, two weevils, Neochetina bruchi and N. eichhorniae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and a moth, Niphograpta albiguttalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), were released in the 1980s. Additionally, a planthopper, Megamelus scutellaris (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) was released in 2011. We conducted monthly surveys for one year at 16 sites throughout 1667 km2 of the Delta to determine the resulting establishment, abundance and distribution of these introduced herbivores. Morphological identifications​, and partial sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene determined that 96.6% of the examined weevils were N. bruchi. N. eichhorniae was only recovered from two sites in the southern Delta tributaries. Densities (larvae and adult weevils per destructively sampled plant) varied spatially and temporally. Peak mean densities (averaged across August–November​) decreased with increasing distance from the original release sites. Peak mean densities ranged from 0.31 to 6.31 weevils per plant. Densities averaged across sites were the lowest in June 2015 (0.54 weevils), increasing in August to 5.35 weevils, and peaking in November at 6.22 weevils. The proportion of damaged leaf area from weevil feeding increased concomitantly with weevil densities. Although N. albiguttalis was not recovered, M. scutellaris remained established at its original release site but has not dispersed into the other surveyed regions. We propose hypotheses to explain patterns in species establishment and distribution, with potential mechanisms for improved future biological control."
