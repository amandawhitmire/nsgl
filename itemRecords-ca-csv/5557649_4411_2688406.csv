10,Abstract:,"Nearly 20 different ecdysteroids have been identified from over 25 crustacean species. The dynamics of ecdysteroid metabolism and excretion were followed in adult lobsters, ""Homarus americanus"". Ecdysteroids were injected into lobsters at five stages in the molt cycle, and the levels of metabolites produced were determined. These studies have revealed the changes in ecdysteroid metabolism that occur during the molt cycle, and elucidated the excretory routes for injected ecdysteroids."
