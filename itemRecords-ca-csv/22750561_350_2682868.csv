9,Abstract:,"With such an important driver of both the national and regional economy, it is important for the Southern California public to understand the value and impact of its two major seaports. USC Sea Grant created the monthly online publication, “Ship’s Log,” covering a wide variety of port topics. The publication is read and distributed across USC Sea Grant’s extended networks including by the highly valued traffic manager for the ports."
