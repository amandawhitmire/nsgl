9,Abstract:,"Behavioral studies combined with DNA fingerprinting to assess paternity of individual egg capsules are helping to resolve questions regarding the targeted fishing of squid. In this paper, the author outlines an approach to studying reproductive behavior in the context of fisheries management, and speculates on features of the mating system of ""Logigo opalescens"" that should be understood before high levels of exploitation are permitted."
