11,Abstract:,"Vertebrae from blue sharks collected off California and Japan were used in a cross-exchange, dual method, and comparative reading approach to determine if apparent differences in growth curves and von Bertalanffy growth parameters from the two areas are due to population characteristicsâ€‹, methodologies, sampling, or the statistics used to characterize growth. Results varied considerably among readers and shark sizes. Some of the differences in growth between populations could have been due to the methodology used, interpretation of growth zones, and the goodness-of-fit of von Bertalanffy growth function to the data. Real differences, if they exist, are obscured by variability due to methods, interpretation, and statistical fit."
