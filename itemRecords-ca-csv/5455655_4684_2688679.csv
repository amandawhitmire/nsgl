10,Abstract:,"Juvenile hormones are sesquiterpene derivatives that regulate a number of developmental and reproductive functions in insects. Investigations into the mode of action of juvenile hormone (JH) at the cellular level is hampered in whole tissues by the relatively high concentrations of endogenous hormone present and by mixed populations of cell types. In this report, the use of the radiolabelled photoaffinity analogue, [3H]EFDA, in the further characterizatio​n of the intracellular JH binding protein in the cytoplasm of ""Drosophila melanogaster"" Kc cells is described."
