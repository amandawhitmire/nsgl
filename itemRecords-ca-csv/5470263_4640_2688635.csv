14,Abstract:,"Recent results have indicated that thyroid and other hormones stored in yolk may represent an additional source of regulatory compounds that are capable of influencing larval development. The origin of thyroid hormones in unfertilized fish eggs has been tentatively ascribed to the deposition of hormones from the maternal circulation into the yolk of developing oocytes. However, the evidence in support of this hypothesis is indirect, and the unlikely possibility of de novo synthesis of thyroid hormones in yolk has not been ruled out. The present experiments were designed to address directly the question of maternal transfer of thyroid hormones to the eggs of the striped bass."
