10,Abstract:,"The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) adopted a Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP) in 2013. Section 1.4 of the FEP outlines an annual reporting process, where the Council requests that NMFS provide yearly updates on the state of the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). The report should summarize and synthesize environmental, biological and socio-economic indicators relevant to the state of the CCE. NOAA’s Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) team, in collaboration with the Council’s Ecosystem Plan Development Team (EPDT), produced a thorough report on conditions in the CCE for the Council’s November 2011 meeting (Agenda Item H.1). At the Council’s November 2012 meeting (Agenda Item K.3), the IEA team and EPDT presented a streamlined, updated report of the state of the CCE. The present document is the second iteration state-​of-​the-​CCE report and provides an annual update of IEA results, taking into account comments received from the Council and the public."
