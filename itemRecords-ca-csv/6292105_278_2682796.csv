12,Abstract:,"This research addresses Sea Grant's Strategic Plan research goal of sustainable resource use. Specifically to minimize the use of fish meal and fish oil in the diet of two of California's top candidates for offshore aquaculture - the California yellowtail (YT), Seriola lalandi and white seabass (WSB), Atractoscion nobilis. It also addresses recent California legislation (SB201) which states ""To reduce adverse effects on global ocean ecosystems, the use of fish meal and fish oil shall be minimized. Where feasible, alternatives to fish meal and fish oil, or fish meal and fish oil made from seafood harvesting byproducts, shall be utilize..."" Limited information is available on acceptability and utilization of alternative low fish meal diets by either California yellowtail or white seabass. These studies used the ""blended protein"" substitution approach, which allows for the determination of interactive and additive effects of multiple ingredients."
