13,Abstract:,"What is the future of commercial fisheries in the Santa Barbara Channel? To help answer that question, the authors analyzed the recent history of the fisheries and related facilities and services, and recommend changes that could improve the viability of the fishing industry. The report describes the environmental, regulatory and economic challenges affecting the fisheries, provides profiles of the top three fisheries in the region and discusses anticipated changes. Taken together, commercial fisheries of the SBC will continue in the future, provided sufficient and appropriate infrastructure and community support. Maintenance and improvement of harbor infrastructure is critical for enabling local fishery participants to continue providing high quality seafood and other marine products. With the downsizing of the commercial fisheries, these facilities and services need to become more adaptive to the changes in the type of fisheries and fishing activity. Likewise, support from local communities is needed for developing practical management that allows for sustainable fisheries and fishing communities, while protecting and enhancing marine resources."
