11,Abstract:,"Coastal birds, wildlife, fish and shellfish depend on abundant food and living space. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) threaten coastal marine life and structures all over the world. Most AIS are carried across the ocean on ships, while boats help to spread them along the coast. Good hull husbandry can help to manage the threats posed by AIS."
