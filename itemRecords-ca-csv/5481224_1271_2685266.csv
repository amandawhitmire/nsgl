11,Abstract:,"The Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") supports important commercial fisheries from California to Alaska. Harvesting female crabs is prohibited in all fisheries except British Columbia; consequently, extensive research has been undertaken on the economically important male crab population, while the growth and reproductive dynamics of female crabs remain poorly described. All Dungeness crab fisheries have exhibited dramatic fluctuations in commercial landings. Previous studies found that fluctuations in landings might result from density-â€‹dependent egg/larval survival; density dependence reflected fluctuations in estimated abundance and total egg production of the unexploited female population. With that as background, this paper presents results of research specifically designed to determine growth, fecundity, and natural mortality of the adult female Dungeness crab population in northern California."
