8,Abstract:,"Sensory evaluation courses can help brokers, processors, regulators, analytical laboratories and retailers involved in supplying, purchasing and inspecting seafood in the U.S. think and smell on par with FDA inspectors. Processors and exporters to the U.S. may be especially interested in understanding the standards applied by the regulatory agencies of countries of origin and the types of odors that can cause their shipments to be rejected. Sensory training is available through courses offered by universities, trade associations and consultants. Through a variety of teaching methods (blind sampling; sequenced, graded sampling; group discussions) using multiple increments of the same fish with different odor characteristicsâ€‹, participants gain valuable hands-on and ""nose-on"" calibrating experience in learning how U.S. federal seafood inspectors evaluate seafood products."
