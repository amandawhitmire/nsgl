15,Abstract:,"To investigate contemporary pinto abalone Haliotis kamtschatkana kamtschatkana recruitment events and juvenile abundance, 66 abalone recruitment modules (ARMs) were deployed at two depths and three sites in the San Juan Archipelago (Washington State) that were historically inhabited by substantial abalone populations. Based on published studies from California and British Columbia, ARMs are proven tools for surveying juvenile pinto abalone abundance. Abalone recruitment modules provide complex habitat and protection from predation. The ARMs were surveyed in situ for juvenile abalone abundance six times over the course of 26 months. Only eight abalones were observed, including three juveniles that were less than 50 mm (shell length). The mean density of juvenile abalones inhabiting the ARMs across all three sites during the 2006 surveys was 0.012/m2. The absence of juvenile abalones within the ARMs, combined with sharp regional declines in adult pinto abalone abundance, suggests limited local recruitment of this species, which is currently designated as threatened in Canada and as a species of concern in the USA."
