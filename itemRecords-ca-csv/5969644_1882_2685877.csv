11,Abstract:,"Here scientists describe the development of the digestive tract and accessory glands in California halibut ""Paralichthys californicus"" from hatching to metamorphosis (42 days post hatch, dph) at 18 degrees C. Differentiation of the alimentary canal into the buccopharynx, esophagus, pre- and postvalvular intestine, and rectum was complete by 3 dph, coinciding with the time of first feeding. Zymogen granules (pancreatic enzyme precursors) were detected in the exocrine pancreas 1 day before the onset of exogenous feeding and their number increased after first feeding, confirming the importance of pancreatic secretions during the agastric period of larval development and their genetically rather than dietarily induced secretion. The stomach was morphologically differentiated at 27-30 dph, coinciding with the onset of eye migration. At this stage, gastric glands were abundant in the fundic region and cardiac and pyloric regions were also clearly distinguishableâ€‹."
