9,Abstract:,"The non-native kelp Undaria pinnatifida is a quick-growing, opportunistic non-native kelp that is a ""least-wanted"" pest species around the world. Uncontrolled, Undaria can become a fouling species on ship hulls, nets, fishing gear, moorings, ropes ,docks and aquaculture species and structures. Because of its quick growth and large size, it is also capable of having a profound influence on the ecosystem, by competing with native seaweeds for space and light. Your help is needed to report new sightings! Please report any sightings along with key details, as outlined below. Early detection can help prevent the further spread of this invasive species. You can also assist by inspecting your boat and slip and removing Undaria if you find it, especially before getting underway and by joining removal efforts"
