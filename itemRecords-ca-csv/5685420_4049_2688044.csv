10,Abstract:,"Accurate detection of clouds in satellite imagery, also referred to as cloud screening or cloud segmentation, is fundamental to the analysis of satellite data. Undetected clouds, for example, represent one of the most significant sources of errors in sea surface temperature determination from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) thermal infrared data. In this paper, neural networks are used to detect clouds in AVHRR scenes over ocean. Results show that neural networks accurately detect cloud in a small image sample set, as well as in images from a broad geographic region which is subject to large latitudinal, interannual and seasonal variations in atmospheric conditions. This approach makes use of the neural network's ability to classify data in a complex decision space and to extract relationships between the multispectral AVHRR data."
