8,Abstract:,"A three year study of the functional characteristics of Scuba Regulators was conducted as part of the UCLA Diving Safety Research Project. Five regulators were randomly selected from each of the 38 regulator models and tested under the following conditions: 1: 6, 15, 30 breaths/min at 3 liters tidal volume; 2: 0, 10, 20, 40, 60 meters; 3: dry and submerged. The resulting individual performance graphs were analyzed using an electronic digitizing apparatus and computer program. The results dramatically illustrated the need for proper training in the use and maintenance of the regulator. The U.C.L.A. Diving Safety Research Project received support for this study from the Office of Sea Grant as well as various manufacturers and other private sources. The study was conducted at U.C.L.A. in the Underwater Kinesiology Laboratory during the period of 1975-1978."
