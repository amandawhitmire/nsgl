10,Abstract:,"POMEROY, Caroline and STEVENS, Melissa M. (CA Sea Grant Ext) Reconstructing Fisheries and Fishing Communities: Insights from the North Coast Fishing Communities Project. Most US fisheries and fishing communities have undergone significant change, especially since the 1970s. Understanding the drivers of change, and the associated interactions and feedbacks, is central to the design, assessment, and adjustment of marine ecosystem management. The North Coast Fishing Communities Project has used an iterative approach that integrates local knowledge and perspectives with archival data (e.g., fishery landings) to build richer, historically grounded profiles of four North Coast fishing communities and fisheries. This paper discusses the methods used and insights gained, with particular attention to the challenges of reconciling qualitative local knowledge and quantitative archival data. cmpomeroy@ucdavâ€‹is.edu (F-101)"
