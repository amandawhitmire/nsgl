13,Abstract:,"Bar-built estuaries are coastal environments characterized by the partial closure of the estuary's mouth with asandbar barrier for extended periods (closed state). Through natural events (rainfall) or anthropogenic influences,the sandbar is breached, reopening the estuary to the ocean. The transition from closed to open state oftenleads to extensive physical and chemical changes in the estuarine conditions, as water mixing and sedimentresuspe​nsion are increased, which could result in the oxidation of sediment acid-volatile sulfides (AVS). Wefollowed monthly changes in water's and sediment geochemical characteristics at thirty-two sites spanning thePescadero Estuary over a one-year period. We showed that the transition from closed to open state leads tosignificant decreases in aqueous pH to circumneutral values and significant increases in aqueous hydrogensulfide and iron concentrations to 10.6 μM and 59.1 μM, respectively, due to sediment AVS oxidation followingsedime​nt resuspension. Aqueous hydrogen sulfide concentrations observed in both closed and open states weresignificant​ly higher than the recommended thresholds for aquatic life. Moreover, mildly acidic water conditionsin the open state were lower than the recommended limits for aquatic life. Our spatial analysis further highlightedthat some parts of the estuary were more vulnerable to decreased water quality. Indeed, high sedimentAVS contents (19–24 mmol kg−1) were observed year-round at the River Confluence and Butano Creek regions,which implies a high potential for severe water acidification and metal release when the estuary transitions fromclosed to open state."
