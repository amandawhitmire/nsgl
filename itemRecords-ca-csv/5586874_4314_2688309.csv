10,Abstract:,"The current fishery for Pacific hagfish (""Eptatretus stoutti"") provides skins for export to Korea and Japan, where they are made into a soft, durable leather marketed as eel skin. It was begun in 1988 from California to British Columbia in response to decline in Asian stocks, but it declined after 1990 because of problems with skin tears. This nascent west coast fishery has the potential to grow by improving harvesting and handling methods. The authors of this report found, in small-scale experiments, that holding hagfish in iced seawater minimizes skin tears without tainting the meat, which also might be exportable. They also found ways to optimize the use of traps and bait for catching hagfish."
