8,Abstract:,"Large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and underlying ocean conditions in the Northeast Pacific have a strong bearing on continental climate and water availability in California, as demonstrated in the past century of instrumental measurements. However, the nature of the relationship between ocean-atmosphere processes and climate variability in the Sierra Nevada of California remains unclear on timescales greater than a few decades, and during past climate regimes of the Holocene and Late Pleistocene. The ~20,000-year sedimentary record recovered from Swamp Lake (SL), a mid-elevation (1554 m) lake in Yosemite National Park, provides a rare opportunity to reconstruct climatic variability in the central Sierra at <100-yr resolution in relation to known or theorized regime shifts in the North Pacific and global drivers of climate. The SL sediment sequence is unique in a number of respects. Radiocarbon dating places the age of the lowest sediment unit at>18,000 years before present (yr BP) (extrapolated to 19,700 yr BP at the base), making the SL record the longest yet recovered from the western Sierra Nevada. In addition, much of the sequence, including virtually the entire Holocene, is annually-varved, with high organic matter (OM) content but no carbonate phases, making this a promising site for the application of organic geochemical proxies."
