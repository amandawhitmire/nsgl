9,Abstract:,"Cytochrome P450s (CYP) are one of the major classes of detoxification enzymes found in terrestrial and aquatic organisms ranging from bacteria to vertebrates. These enzymes metabolize a wide variety of substrates including endogenous molecules (e.g. fatty acids, eicosenoids, steroids) and xenobiotics (e.g. hydrocarbons, pesticides, drugs). The author of this paper reviews advances of the last decade in the study of cytochrome P450s in aquatic invertebrates and discusses related insect studies."
