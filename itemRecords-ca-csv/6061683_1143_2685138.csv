11,Abstract:,"Tributyltin (TBT)-based antifouling paints have proven extremely effective at preventing the fouling of ships' hulls and consequently the transport of aquatic invasive species (AIS). The U.S. partially banned the use of TBT in 1988 and a global ban is forthcoming. The global ban may have serious implications in the management of AIS transport. This survey of the legal regime in the U.S. regarding prevention of pollution from tributyltin and copper antifouling paints was commissioned by California Sea Grant to support research, education, and outreach activities."
