9,Abstract:,"This angler's guide describes the fishing opportunities available in the coastal waters of Humboldt County in northern California. Although most dream of a prize salmon, anglers may find rockfish, cabezon, lingcod, and smelt as well, and are frequently guaranteed a meal's worth of bottomfish and surfperch. This guide describes the fishing to be found in some of the areas along this rugged, isolated, and rocky coast, characterized by cool northern summers and damp winters."
