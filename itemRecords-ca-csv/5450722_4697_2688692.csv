12,Abstract:,"The course of changes of vitellogenin (VG) concentrations in the hemolymph of female lobsters, ""Homarus americanus"", was studied following a photoperiodic stimulation of secondary vitellogenesis. Two immunochemicall​y related VGs were found, each corresponding to an ovarian lipovitellin. Changes in VG hemolymph concentration could be related to photoperiodic schedule, and to the occurrence of molting, egg extrusion, ovarian resorption, and to VG clearance from the hemolymph."
