10,Abstract:,"Salmonids must maintain the ion content of their body fluids at concentrations distinctly different from the osmotic environment both in the river and in the ocean. Fish in fresh water face a net loss of salt and a net influx of water. Fish in seawater must obtain water and excrete surplus salts. In this paper, the development of osmoregulatory ability in yearling coho salmon during smoltification and the effects of hypophysectomy and treatments with thyroxine and with prolactin were examined using transepithelial potential (TEP) as the criterion for response."
