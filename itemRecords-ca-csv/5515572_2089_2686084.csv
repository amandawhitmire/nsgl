10,Abstract:,"Data on size-​fractionated zooplankton biomasses from the California Current in summer were examined to (1) verify that euphausiid and smaller zooplankton biomasses varied in similar ways geographically and interannually, and (2) test for increase in euphausiid biomass after 1966, concurrent with initiation of a fishery on Pacific whiting (a major predator of euphausiids), and distinct from general, interannual changes. Although the first objective was accomplished, researchers were unable to detect a significant effect attributable to the Pacific whiting fishery."
