7,Abstract:,"During March 2006, University of California Marine Fisheries Specialist Christopher Dewees organized a study tour to New Zealand for 20 fishing community leaders from the United States. The purpose of this site is to share the experience of those 20 tour participants with a broader audience interested in learning more about New Zealand marine fisheries management. New Zealand faced economic and sustainability difficulties during the 1980s and implemented a market-based or individual quota marine fisheries management system. In the ensuing years the country has seen dramatic changes in its commercial fishing industry. Follow the links in the navigation bar to learn more about the New Zealand fisheries management experience. Support for the Study Tour was provided by three foundations interested in sustainable fisheries -- Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, The Bradley Fund for the Environment of Sand County Foundation, Alex C. Walker Foundation, and the California Sea Grant Program."
