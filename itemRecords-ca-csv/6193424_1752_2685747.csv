10,Abstract:,"Concentrations of dissolved copper that exceed government regulatory standards are being detected in Shelter Island Yacht Basin of San Diego Bay and in Newport Bay in southern California, as well as in marinas and harbors of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, of Port Canaveral and Indian River in Florida, and in areas of Washington. Dissolved copper levels in America's Cup Harbor, Harbor Island, the Marriott Marina, and the Laurel Street area of San Diego Bay, in Dana Point Harbor and in Oceanside Harbor have also been proposed for regulatory attention. Nontoxic alternatives to commonly used copper hull coatings can greatly reduce, and in some cases eliminate, copper contamination associated with recreational boats. A variety of different policy options are available to mandate or provide economic incentives to switch to these less harmful alternatives. These options are proposed and evaluated for use in San Diego Bay. A conceptual framework for evaluating policies to transition to these alternatives is put forth in terms of copper concentrations and coasts to boat owners. Impacts on other parties such as boatyards, hull cleaners, and marinas are also considered."
