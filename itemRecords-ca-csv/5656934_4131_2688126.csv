11,Abstract:,"Components of sex recognition by American lobsters, ""Homarus americanus"", have been characterized by detailed study of videotaped recordings of both intra- and intersexual interactions in temporarily blinded lobsters. These analyses have permitted description of behaviors typically displayed by lobsters in agonistic intrasexual interactions in the absence of visual cues. The results suggest that sex recognition occurring over short distances may not rely on visual information. A method of antennal gland cannulation was developed that allowed for continuous collection of voided urine from individual lobsters in paired interactions away from contact with the seawater. Normal behavior patterns were observed in all intra- and intersexual pairings of lobsters. Courtship and mating also occurred when either or both intermolt male and postmolt female were cannulated, indicating that urine is not a source of factors required for lobster sex recognition."
