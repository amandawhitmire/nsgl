10,Abstract:,"This report synthesizes and summarizes results from published USC Sea Grant research on harmful algal blooms funded between 2012-2018. It is part of a series of reports reviewing published research funded by USC Sea Grant, grouped by major ocean and watershed-​focused research themes. This research report series aims to provide California stakeholders and policy makers with key findings on ocean issues to assist in decision-making at the local and state levels. Further, it serves to increase science literacy for broader audiences. Increasing local and regional understanding of globally-​relevant scientific issues can improve the management of stressors on California’s coastal and marine environments and ensure the longevity of our valuable coastal ecosystems, economies and resources. The report's three key findings are: 1. A Warmer Climate and More Acidic Ocean Can Increase Bloom Toxicity Warming waters and increased carbon dioxide (ocean acidification) can increase the toxicity of harmful algal blooms, especially under conditions of low nutrient availability. 2. Environmental Conditions Interact to Affect Toxicity The toxicity of harmful algal blooms depends upon interactions among environmental variables influenced by natural and human processes such as temperature, carbon dioxide, solar radiation and nutrients such as nitrogen and silicate. 3. Freshwater Toxins Can Spread to the Coast Toxins from harmful algal blooms in freshwater environments (cyanotoxins) can spread from the watershed into coastal waters at the land-sea interface."
