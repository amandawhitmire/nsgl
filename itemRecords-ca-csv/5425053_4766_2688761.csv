11,Abstract:,"Experiments were conducted to develop a purified diet suitable for studying nutritional requirements of juvenile white sturgeon (""Acipenser transmontanus"")â€‹. Fish fed SPD diet with lecithin grew significantly better than those fed SPD diet with its 8% lecithin replaced with an equal amount of an oil mixture. Fish with good growth and survival rates also had significantly lower body moisture and higher protein and lipid contents than fish with poor growth and survival rates. Results suggest that the SPD diet with lecithin and without cholesterol (SPD-C) is a suitable purified diet for juvenile white sturgon."
