11,Abstract:,"Using an implementation of the Region Ocean Modeling System, we investigate the influenceof larval vertical swimming on spring dispersal for nearshore invertebrate species in the CaliforniaCurre​nt System (CCS), with a focus on central California and the Bodega Bay area. Larvae are givena suite of idealized behaviors designed to reveal the importance of the surface boundary layer (SBL)to transport and settlement. Larvae remain near 5 m, 30 m, or transition between these depths usingvarious strategies, including diel vertical migration (DVM) and ontogenetic vertical migration. Somebehaviors result in modeled densities qualitatively similar to observed cross-shelf larval distributions.B​y remaining primarily below the SBL, larvae released from central California are 500 times morelikely to be retained within 5 km of the coast at 30 days from release relative to those that stay nearsurface, and 145 times more likely to settle along the coast within a 30 to 60 day pelagic larvalduration. For most behaviors, nearshore retention over time could be approximated as a modifiedexponen​tial decay process. Vertical swimming also greatly affects alongshore dispersal, with eachbehavior resulting in a unique structure of alongshore settlement. Maintaining a depth near 30 mincreases settlement throughout most of the CCS by at least an order of magnitude relative to passivelarvae. Remaining near surface reduces settlement from Pt. Conception to Pt. Arena, but has less ofan effect north of Cape Mendocino. Relative to passive larvae, DVM increases settlement in regional“hotspo​ts,” but does not greatly alter overall recruitment in the CCS, and ontogenetic vertical migrationincrea​ses settlement for central California regions south of Bodega Bay"
