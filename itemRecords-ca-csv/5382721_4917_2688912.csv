11,Abstract:,"Kelp bass (""Paralabrax clathratus"") and leopard sharks (""Triakis semifasciata"") are characterized by an acellular (anosteocytic) bony skeleton and a focally calcified cartilaginous endoskeleton, respectively, skeletal forms not considered to function as mineral reservoirs. We tested the ability of these fish to resorb bone matrix and to adapt to reduced salinity conditions. In sharks, implanted bone particles were not resorbed, and multinucleated cells were not evident under either normal or hyposalinity conditions. In marked contrast, bass adapted to diluted seawater resorbed bone particles and maintained normal serum chemistries; the bone particles were surrounded by large, foamy multinucleated cells, many with membrane specializations typical of osteoclasts from higher vertebrates. Although osteoclasts had not been described in these fish, this study shows that bass have stem cells that can be stimulated to differentiate into bone-resorbing osteoclasts."
