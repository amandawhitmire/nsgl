8,Abstract:,"Potential natural mortality of bluebanded goby, ""Lythrypnus dalli"", associated with blooms of ""Gonyaulax catenella"" was studied in the laboratory. ""Cancer anthonyi"" larvae were fed the toxic dinoflagellate with no deleterious effects, but when gobies were presented with ""G. catenella""-fed larvae death ensued. Gobies placed directly in a culture of ""G. catenella"" died even more rapidly and exhibited characteristics of paralytic poisoning: erratic swimming, loss of balance and buoyancy. Although these results suggest a mechanism in which ""G. catenella"" toxins may be transmitted through the food chain by crab larvae to goby, apparently ""G. catenella"" may also cause fish mortality directly."
