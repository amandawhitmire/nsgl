10,Abstract:,"The authors of this study report the effects of neuroactive steroids on the behavior of lobster, ""Homarus americanus,"" in a modified open-field apparatus. They present data on lobster locomotor behavior and its use in defining the effects of the neuroactive steroid modulators of GABA A- type receptors as a continuation of work involving benzodiazepine effects on lobster locomotor activity."
