12,Abstract:,"Shrimp mariculture, the leading form of aquaculture for the Pacific coast of Mexico is facing catastrophic losses due to disease and falling prices. Previous work conducted by a multi-​institutional, international team since 1997 has built a solid foundation for diversification of aquaculture in Pacific Mexico emphasizing the use of native species, particularly those low on the food chain and with low culture technology requirements. Among the leading candidates are bivalves, which are currently cultured and fished extensively along the Gulf of California Coast, with much of the production attributed to wild capture fisheries. Great potential exists, however, to expand current aquaculture production through strengthening existing operations, either by developing new markets or increasing sales in current ones according to consumer preferences."
