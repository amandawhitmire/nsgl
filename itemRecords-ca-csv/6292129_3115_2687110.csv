9,Abstract:,"Nematodes, also known as roundworms, are among the most abundant groups of animals on the planet. If you had pinworms as a child, you've experienced nematodes firsthand - and are not alone, as at any given time, about a third of the world's population is believed to be infected by some kind of nematode parasite. Nematodes, many species of which are not parasitic, are also incredibly common denizens of coastal sediments, and an important source of nourishment for shellfish and bigger worms, which themselves are forage species for other animals. Because of this, roundworms are critical components of the coastal food web, and hence a meaningful ""bottom-up"" indicator of coastal ecosystem functioning. More to the point for the region's coastal wetlands projects, roundworm communities - the species present and absent at a site, and their relative numbers - may shed light on the pace, progress and success of multi-million dollar earth-moving projects such the construction of the Bolsa Chica Wetlands in Huntington Beach, Orange County, a former coastal oil field that was closed to tidal flushing for more than a century."
