11,Abstract:,"Although salmon hatcheries release large and healthy fish which appear to have completed the parr-smolt transformation which prepares them for life in the ocean, the limited contribution of these animals to the fishery strongly suggests that many are not functional smolts. Essential to the success of the west coast salmonid fishery is the ability to identify fully-â€‹smoltified fish and to release them at the appropriate time; otherwise, fish may fail to out-migrate or may fail to grow in the ocean. Attention has therefore focused on environmental and endocrine factors contributing to the parr-smolt transformation. Described in this paper are ways by which basic endocrine research may be applied in order to increase the contribution of hatchery-reared fish to the salmonid fishery in California."
