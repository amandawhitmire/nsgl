13,Abstract:,"This report will focus on invasive species transported on hulls of boats kept in saltwater. Although the focus is on California and Baja California, information from other areas has been included to provide context. The report is intended to assist the following groups in cooperating to prevent and control introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) on hulls of boats, while protecting coastal water quality: boat owners; boat maintenance, repair and coating businesses; port, harbor, marina and yacht club managers; scientists; policy makers; government agencies; and environmental organizations. Recreational boats that are generally kept in saltwater, removed only for maintenance and travel by sea from one location to another are the focus of this report. Some findings may also be suitable for commercial fishing and commercial-​passenger fishing boats. Recommendations and resources for controlling AIS on trailered boats are available from the excellent Stop Aquatic Hitchhikers! website at may also carry invasive species on their hulls. When is a non-native fouling organism invasive? Fouling occurs when marine microbes, plants, and animals, and/or their spores and larvae attach and grow on the hull of a boat or ship. If they survive the trip to a distant harbor, they may spawn, release spores, or be removed and discarded there. If they succeed in the new area, they may create problems. For example, they may: out-compete local species for food; overgrow them and alter their habitat; damage shorelines and structures; cause new diseases for humans and marine life; and be expensive to control or eradicate. A species that crowds out competitors and dominates an area reduces the diversity of its marine life. The importance of biological diversity is explained more fully in Section II. The invasive strain of the green alga, Caulerpa taxifolia, has overgrown thousands of acres of Mediterranean Sea bottom and displaced many other species of marine life. In 2000-2005 US$4.5 million was spent to eradicate C. taxifolia from Agua Hedionda Lagoon in San Diego County and Huntington Harbor in neighboring Orange County and to continue monitoring efforts. The European green crab (Carcinus maenas) competes with the native and commercially important Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) from Central California to British Columbia.5 It also feeds on cultured oysters, mussels and native clams, enters and fills traps for eels and bait fish, and is believed to have caused the collapse of the soft clam fishery on the United States' East Coast. C. maenus is thought to have reached the United States as early larval stages on ship hulls or among rocks and mud used as solid ballast."
