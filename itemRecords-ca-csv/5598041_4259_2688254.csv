9,Abstract:,"Most (generally 80%) catastrophic marine accidents are the event of compounded human and organizational errors (HOE) during operations. These types of errors can be distinguished as active errors or 'initiating' errors, which normally result in immediate consequences, and latent errors, which can lie dormant within systems for indefinite periods of time, becoming evident only when combined with active errors under unique circumstances. This report addresses the limitations and advantages of existing HOE marine casualty reports, and databases. In addition, it reviews existing and proposed HOE taxonomies for the development of a commonly used and accepted taxonomy and database system for both tankers and platforms to be implemented by operators, regulators, and designers of offshore platform and tanker operations."
