11,Abstract:,"The growth and decay of secondary flow in meandering channels are driven by the local imbalance among the forces associated with centrifugal acceleration, gravitational acceleration due to transverse water-surface slope, and turbulent shear. The phase lag of secondary flow is defined as the phase difference between the meandering channel curvature and the pattern of secondary flow. A simple expression for the phase lag is analytically derived in this paper from the equation of motion for secondary flow, based on the growth and decay of secondary flow through meandering channels."
