7,Abstract:,"Successful sturgeon farms are being established based on the existing technology and feed formulations that are used for culturing other species of fish. Early feeding trials, however, indicate that prolonged feeding of dry commercial rainbow trout feeds used by most of the sturgeon farms sometimes results in poor growth, loss of equilibrium, and other abnormal signs suspected to be nutrition-​related. The dietary role of micronutrients (e.g. vitamins, minerals and trace elements) in sturgeon basically is unknown. More information is needed before a nutrient-​balanced, cost-effective commercial sturgeon feed can be developed. Ongoing research efforts in that direction are described."
