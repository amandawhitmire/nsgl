15,Abstract:,"The biomineralizati​on process involves soluble proteins and organized organic structures in multiprocess assembly to create composite materials of a given phase and growth morphology. Emulsion biphase chemistry in materials synthesis has been demonstrated to offer the possibility of simultaneously controlling shape of the micro to centimeter length, and periodic mesostructure at the molecular mesoscale. This paper briefly reviews the use of multiprocess assembly strategies to synthesize structures organized in three dimensions on two or more length scales. These strategies require weak, long-range forces, non- equilibrium systems, kinetic control, and reaction environments, that can be controlled or modulated without interruption by applied fields or hydrodynamic forces."
