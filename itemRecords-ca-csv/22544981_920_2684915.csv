13,Abstract:,"Anthropogenic oil in the ocean is of great concern due to its potential immediate and long-term impacts on the ecosystem,econo​my, and society, leading to intense societal efforts to mitigate and reduce inputs. Sources of oil in the ocean (in the orderof importance) are natural marine seepage, run-off from anthropogenic sources, and oil spills, yet uncertainty and variability inthese budgets are large, particularly for natural seepage, which exhibits large spatial and temporal heterogeneity on local toregional scales. When source inputs are comparable, discriminating impacts is complicated, because petroleum is both abioavailable, chemosynthetic energy source to the marine ecosystem and a potential toxic stressor depending on concentration,c​omposition, and period of time. This synthesis review investigates the phenomena underlying this complexity and identifiesknowl​edge gaps. Its focus is on the Coal Oil Point (COP) seep field, arguably the best-studied example, of strong natural marinehydrocarb​on seepage, located in the nearshore, shallow waters of the Northern Santa Barbara Channel, Southern California,wher​e coastal processes complicate oceanography and meteorology. Many of our understandings of seep processes globally arebased on insights learned from studies of the oil and gas emissions from the COP seep field. As one of the largest seep fields inthe world, its impacts spread far as oil drifts on the sea surface and subsurface, yet much remains unknown of its impacts."
