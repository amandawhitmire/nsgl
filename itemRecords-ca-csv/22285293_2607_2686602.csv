11,Abstract:,"Natural resource sustainability depends on adaptive capacity: thelatent ability of a social–ecologic​al system to rely on or implement effective strategies to cope with disturbances. We propose and implementa new three-step framework for studying a social–ecologic​alsystem’s adaptive capacity that consists of assessment, strategy identification, and activation. We apply this framework to analyze the adaptive capacity of the Monterey Bay wetfish fisheries community in response to a significant stressor in the system: El Nino Southern scillation (ENSO). We conducted 49 semi-structured interviews with articipants engaged in these fisheries and/or providing ENSO information. Of the 67 social–ecologic​al strategies identified through a literature review, we found 42 contribute to high adaptive capacity to ENSO. The most influential strategies were matching formal and informal rules to system dynamics, diversifying livelihoods, enhancing economic safety nets, social learning, and accessing early warning systems. Our findings suggest approaches for enhancing adaptive capacity in other resource systems."
