10,Abstract:,"Elucidation of the mechanisms of biological silica synthesis and structural control lead to new, low- temperature and environmentally benign routes to the manufacture of high-​performance silicon-based materials. Through analysis of the proteins and genes controlling these processes, the underlying molecular mechanisms governing silica synthesis in two different living systems (sponges and diatoms) have recently been revealed, and the mechanisms adapted for new routes to polysiloxane synthesis ""in vitro."" Here the authors provide a review of the current knowledge of silicon transporters, frustulins and other outer proteins, HEPs and silaffins, silica deposition vesicles, and the activity and biomimetic synthesis of silicateins."
