13,Abstract:,"Probably the first of its kind in the nation, the conference entitled ""Fisheries Education in Alaska; Creating a Program of Excellence"" was an attempt to have the fishing industry join the State of Alaska in building fisheries education programs. In his introductory address, Dr. Jay Barton, President of the University of Alaska, pointed out that advanced fisheries education at the technical and university level is needed if Alaska is to keep up with a rapidly changing and highly technological offshore development of the fisheries. Rod Moore, assistant to U.S. Representative Don Young, challenged Alaska to develop its own expertise in resource management, harvesting techniques, processing, and marketing. Our geography, population distribution and potential, and political situation are unique, Moore said. We must ""be imaginative, be cooperative."" Others making presentations at the conference were personnel from the University of California, the College of Fisheries at St. John' s, Newfoundland, Clatsop Community College in Astoria, Oregon, the Jutland Technological Institute of Denmark, the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, and Oregon State University in Corvallis; the American Embassy in Tokyo; Nunam Kitlutsisti, which is the environmental arm of the Association of Village Council Presidents; the Alaska Food Company, Icicle Seafoods in Petersburg, and Peter Pan Seafoods; Groton Bio Industries in Massachusetts and Oregon Aqua-​Foods, which are involved in aquaculture; the Alaska Department of Fish and Game; the National Federation of Fishermen; and the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation. In a short three days those people attending the conference tackled the monumental task of identifying educational needs in terms specific enough for program development, From the many examples of programs in other places, they sought to conceive of appropriately scaled and designed programs that could be implemented here in Alaska. The programs of the Whitefish Authority at Hull, England, represented by Dr. Dennis Lodge, now with Clatsop Community College in Astoria, Oregon, illustrated that science and technology often go hand in hand in fisheries education. Lodge's example of such a partnership was the hydraulic flume tank used by the Whitefish Authority both to assist engineers in net design and to help fishermen learn to use these nets to increase their harvest. Actual vessel and sea conditions are duplicated in the tank. Lodge feels the United States, particularly the west coast, needs to have a tank to increase the competitiveness of the U.S. fishermen. He asked, ""Why not in Alaska?"" Following their presentations, the individual speakers conducted workshops with educators from around the state to discuss educat1on and training needs and methods specific for their area of expert1se. In these individual sessions it quickly became apparent that, due to the diversity of the communities in Alaska, the ""best"" education program and the ""most important"" needs often had little in common from one region to the next. Should one general overall program be designed so that 1t might fit all communities? Or should individual regions design programs that meet their special 1zed needs? It was not possible in the short time allowed to come up with the solutions to such mechanical problems, but it was possible to identify some of the most important fields where educational programs of one form or another are seriously needed today, or will be needed in the near future. The list was long and comprehensive. It included resource management, harvesting techniques, processing techniques, marketing, aquaculture, gear design and manufacture, electronics, vocationa1 and on-the-job training, entry-​level training, qua11ty control, engineering, operations and personnel management, communications, law, and politics."
