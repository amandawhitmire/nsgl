12,Abstract:,"Placers of the modern beaches in northern California, Oregon, and Washington should provide clues to the regional compositional variation of potential placers on the continental shelf. The authors here review the history and report the chief economic mineralogies of representative coastal placers in the Pacific Northwest region. The distribution and compositional variation of modern beach placers and major river sources are documented from northernmost California to southernmost Washington. Finally, these active-margin coastal placers are compared with known heavy-mineral accumulations on the Pacific Northwest continental shelf and other contrasting shelf areas that have been explored for placer mineral deposits."
