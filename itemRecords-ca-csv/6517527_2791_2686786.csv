8,Abstract:,"Stormwater runoff can negatively impact recreational water quality. When rain falls on the land, the water washes over the surface picking up bacterial pollutants from malfunctioning septic systems, wildlife, pet waste, etc. and are transported to the coastal surf-zone by runoff directly to the beach or via freshwater inputs such as rivers, streams and storm drains. The lag time (24-30 hrs) in obtaining fecal indicator bacteria results may pose a public health risk; therefore, some states have implemented an automatic precautionary rainfall advisory system where particularly high risk beaches are closed when rainfall exceeds predetermined levels which can vary widely (0.1-1in.) depending on the state, beach, and local conditions (Massachusetts, New Jersey, California, and Ohio1). Analysis: For each beach management area (BMA) the relationship between antecedent (prior) rainfall within 48hrs of the monitoring event and Enterococci (MPN/100ml) levels was delineated. Each figure represents data collected during routine beach monitoring between Memorial Day and Labor Day from 2008-2013. This analysis was completed for all 60 BMAs spanning Kittery to Mount Desert Island (roughly 200 miles). Included below are three case studies."
