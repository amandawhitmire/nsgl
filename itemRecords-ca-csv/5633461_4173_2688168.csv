10,Abstract:,"The development of multidrug resistance during chemotherapy presents a formidable challenge to successful clinical management of some tumors. A cyclic octapeptide (patellamide D) isolated from the marine tunicate, ""Lissaclinum patella"", acts as a resistance-â€‹modifying agent in the multidrug resistance CEM/VLB100 human leukemic cell line. Patellamide D at 3.3 micrometer was compared with 5.1 micrometer verapamil in modulating drug resistance in vitro. Results indicate that patellamide D acts as a selective antagonist in multidrug resistance and stresses the importance of investigating marine-derived compounds as a potential new source for modulators of the drug-resistance phenotype."
