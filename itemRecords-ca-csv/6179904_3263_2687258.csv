10,Abstract:,"Pseudo-​nitzschia is a nearly ubiquitous genus of pennate diatom that has received greatly increased attention in the last two decades due to the production of the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) by some of its species. There is now considerable evidence of DA production in many temperate zone coastal environments, sufficient to have led to monitoring programs being instated to protect the public from DA poisoning in commercial and sometimes recreational harvests of shellfish. Interestingly, a considerable amount of the literature on DA coastal ""events"" is focused on contamination of vertebrate predators such as marine birds and mammals that are often the indicators of toxic blooms in these ecosystems. Thus DA is recognized as a potential toxin capable of being vectored through food chains to result in mortality of animals several trophic levels away from the alga that produced the toxin. The phenomenon of toxicity in the genus has largely been discussed as a nearshore phenomenon. The goal of this presentation is to present background information to assess the possible production of DA in offshore, oceanic environments and to discuss some concerns about proposed environmental manipulations that may increase Pseudo-​nitzschia there. We briefly review the state of knowledge about oceanic species of Pseudo-​nitzschia that may be DA producers in situ. We then summarize published results of iron fertilization studies that have found ""Nitzschia"" or ""Pseudo-​nitzschia"" to respond to such enrichments. Oceanic iron enrichments are now being widely discussed as a comparatively low cost remedy for carbon dioxide build up in the atmosphere, especially with the possibility of using them to earn ""carbon credits"" in the global carbon marketplace, as global warming concerns rise. We summarize results from published lab and oceanic experiments that suggest Pseudo-​nitzschia responses to such iron enrichments and also data that suggest the genus may be particularly suited to respond to such additions. We suggest some possible food web responses that might accompany a response to iron fertilization by blooms of DA-producing Pseudo-​nitzschia. The second, related talk in this 2-part series will describe some very recent results from a cruise to study Pseudo-​nitzschia and domoic acid from an oceanic area that contains both naturally iron-enriched regions and ones in iron-limited ""high nutrient, low chlorophyll"" (HNLC) regions, the type of environment where such iron enrichments are being proposed."
