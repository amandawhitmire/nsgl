9,Abstract:,"Sperm-egg interaction has been examined in three different decapod species; two belonging to the Pleocyamata (""Macrobrachium rosenbergii, Rhynchocinetes typus"") and one to the Dendrobranchiat​a (""Sicyonia ingentis""). In sperm of both the former, the single appendage is the leading end of the cell and penetrates the egg chorion; in neither case has an acrosome been noted. In ""S. ingentis"", however, a dramatic biphasic acrosome reaction (AR) has been described. While the reaction in ""S. ingentis"" is in many respects analogous to the biphasic AR found in the sperm of other invertebrates there are striking dissimilarities in both morphological and physiological characteristics​. In this review, our present understanding of the AR in the sperm of ""S. ingentis"" is discussed."
