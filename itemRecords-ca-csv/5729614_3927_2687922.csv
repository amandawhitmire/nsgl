11,Abstract:,"This study investigated the production of eicosanoids when ""Limulus"" amebocytes were stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187 and the eicosanoid precursor arachidonic acid (AA). Using high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), several lipid metabolites were qualitatively identified and the major metabolite was quantified. The advent if ESI-MS allows the direct analysis of nonvolatile substances, like fatty acids, without prior derivatization; a step necessary to create volatile compounds for electron impact (EI) and chemical ionization (CI) gas chromatography/​mass spectrometry. The quantitative portion of this study demonstrates the ability of the emerging technology of electrospray mass spectrometry to provide a linear response when analyzing nonvolatile small molecules in the picogram to nanogram range."
