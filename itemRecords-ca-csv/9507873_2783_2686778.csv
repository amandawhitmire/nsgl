11,Abstract:,"There are only limited studies of deterministic effects of radiation in non-humans, the majority of which focused on terrestrial mammals used as proxies for humans. Ethical treatment of laboratory animals necessitates that these animals not face multiple stressors during the course of these experiments. Lacking a direct threshold for deterministic effects from absorbed dose in marine life, an alternative reference level that is available is the absorbed dose from natural and anthropogenic radionuclides that these ecosystems already endure without ill effect. Methodology and challenges in quantifying these doses is presented, in addition to absorbed dose estimates for several member organisms in the Northern California Current."
