9,Abstract:,"An outbreak of ""C. epialti"" on an unfished or lightly fished population of the shore crab, ""H. oregonensis"", is reported and compared with non-outbreak periods for crab egg mortality, worm prevalence, intensity, and seasonal abundance. Heavy fishing pressure on some commercially important crab species has been suggested as a possible factor inducing worm outbreaks and facilitating their continued persistence. Observations here suggest that fisheries are not necessarily responsible for the outbreaks of nemerteans on commercially important crab species. However, fishing pressure may still be a sufficient condition to promote nemertean outbreaks."
