12,Abstract:,"The performance of a one-dimensional longshore current model can be degraded if the neglected effects of longshore bathymetric inhomogeneities are significant or if the forcing and mixing are not parameterized correctly. The two- dimensional equations of motion, coupled with observations of two-dimensional circulation, and inverse methods, can be used to infer the forcing and mixing, and to examine the effect of longshore inhomogeneitiesâ€‹. An idealized example of the inverse approach to solving the equations of motion is shown to predict a rip current through a gap in a longshore inhomogeneous sandbar for the case of normally incident waves."
