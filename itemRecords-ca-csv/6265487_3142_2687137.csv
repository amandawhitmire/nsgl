10,Abstract:,"The Humboldt Bay Initiative (HBI) seeks to bring people together to help envision the desired future state of Humboldt Bay ecosystems and economies, to help understand past, current, and future conditions, and to move forward in the spirit of collaboration towards a sustainable and dynamic future. In order to address priority threats to our ecosystems and economies due to climate change, invasive species, and human activities, the Humboldt Bay Initiative developed a set of goals through a through a formal adaptive management and strategic planning process. HBI goals provide an explicit and shared understanding of our project and help keep us focused on what we want to achieve. Prior to the workshop, HBI conducted a stakeholder analysis. As a result, the Humboldt Bay Initiative participation increased and created a broad, adaptive and inclusive program for implementing EBM. The unique role of HBI is to help facilitate ongoing coordination and collaboration among local communities, elected officials, agencies, and resource managers and to develop, integrate and implement key information."
