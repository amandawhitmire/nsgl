11,Abstract:,"biological invasions, eelgrassm recruitment"
12,,"The authors studied variability in the abundance of small individuals of an invasive mussel (""Musculista senhousia"") across the depth distribution of a native marine angiosperm, eelgrass (""Zostera marina""). Adult mussels and eelgrass have a disjunct local distribution, each limiting the other in complex ways. To assess whether eelgrass also influenced the distribution of juvenile mussels, they sampled inside and outside eelgrass in one site in Mission Bay and two in San Diego Bay, California, USA. They sampled mussels in size classes 0.26-0.50 mm, 0.51-1.00 mm, 1.10-2.00 mm and > 2.00 mm from September 1997 to April 1999. They also monitored gonad development larger mussels and in situ growth of mussels"
