12,Abstract:,"Foliose sponges are considered to have a high potential for phototrophic nutrition by prokaryotic symbionts. There is much speculation, but little proof, that such microorganisms might contribute additional diversity to the range of metabolites isolated from the macroorganism host tissue. This paper reports that two sesquiterpene quinols, cyclorenierins A and B, which are closely related to panicein A2 and renierin A, were isolated as an inseparable mixture from the marine sponge ""Haliclona"" sp. collected in Vanuatu."
