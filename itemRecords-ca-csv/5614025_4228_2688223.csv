11,Abstract:,"Precopulatory and agonistic behaviors were studied in temporarily blinded lobsters. Sex recognition, as indicated by significant, stereotypical changes in behaviors, occurred between an intermolt stage male and intermold, premolt, or postmolt stage females. Courtship and mating also proceeded normally in these lobster pairs. These observations suggest that vision may not be important for aspects of courtship and mating involving short distance interactions. In addition, mating by intermolt and postmolt female lobsters was investigated. Results suggest that the female lobster retains information about her mating status during the current molting cycle."
