10,Abstract:,"Sodium-​dependent transepithelial amino acid transport has been well documented in vertebrate systems. However, a clear demonstration of sodium-​dependent net entry of amino acids for any marine invertebrate simple surface epithelium is lacking. Here the authors present a detailed kinetic analysis of the effects of sodium on the transmembrane transport of serine and leucine by bacteria-free (axenic) larvae of the sea urchin ""Strongylocentr​otus purpuratus"", and show that the translocation of amino acids is electrogenic. The relationship between sodium-​dependent influx, net entry and efflux is analyzed."
