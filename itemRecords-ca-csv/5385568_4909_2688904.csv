9,Abstract:,"Sesquiterpene natural products of the red seaweed epiphyte ""Erythrocystis saccata"" and its host ""Laurencia pacifica"" were compared. Three separate collections of the host-epiphyte pair were investigated, and the sesquiterpene components of the epiphyte were exactly parallel to that of the host. The major components varied as a function of collection location, however. The implications of this parallel secondary metabolite chemistry are briefly discussed."
