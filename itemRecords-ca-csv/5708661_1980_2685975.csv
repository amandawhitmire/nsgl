10,Abstract:,"Approximately one billion barrels of crude oil and products are transported in California waters each year. Based on statistics provided by the California State Lands Commission, tanker discharge and loading operations have a spill frequency that is a factor of 10 higher than that associated with offshore platforms, pipelines, and storage tanks. Spill reports indicate that a significant number of the spills are the result of Human and Organization Factors (HOF) such as poor communications, inadequate training, improper monitoring, inadequate maintenance, improper emergency provisions, and under-staffing resulting in fatigue and excessive stress. The objective of this project has been to further develop engineering procedures to assist in the definition and evaluation of alternatives to minimize the occurrence and effects of HOF in tanker loading and discharge operations."
