10,Abstract:,"Mid-frequency sonar is the most common method used by the U.S. Navy to locate enemy vessels in anti-submarine warfare. According to the Navy,sonar training is of vital importance to the safety of the United States, as hostile nations develop submarines that are more difficult to detect. The effective use of sonar requires a significant amount of training by Navypersonnel in order for the technology to be useful against an enemy submarine."
