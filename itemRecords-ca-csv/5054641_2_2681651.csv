This report includes ongoing project titles and descriptions. T​he Sea Grant Program was created In 1966 by Public Law 89-688, the National Sea Grant College and Program Act. The purpose of the act is to accelerate development of marine resources, Including their conservation, management, and maximum social and economic utilization. Sea Grant supports research, advisory services, and education to these ends, primarily through a group of universities that are designated as Sea Grant Institutions or Sea Grant Colleges. The California Sea Grant Institutional program had Its origins In programs that were started separately at the University of California, San Diego, at San Diego State College, and at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The first two campuses Joined In 1970 to establish an institutional program, covering the full spectrum of education, research, and advisory services that are expected of a Sea Grant institution. This program was further expanded In 1971 to include the existing Sea Grant re search program at UC, Santa Barbara, and to establish new programs of work at other campuses throughout the state. This report summarizes the results of this second year of institutional work, the first year of statewide activity."
