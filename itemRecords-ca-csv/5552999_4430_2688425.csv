15,Abstract:,"In the 1980-81 seasons, 81,200 tons of red king crab were harvested, the third highest yield in the history of the fishery. Three years later the harvest declined precipitously to 1000 tons, the lowest catch in over 30 years. A sample program was begun in 1983, over a large portion of the geographic range of ""Paralithodes camtschatica"", to investigate the decline observed in some stocks coincident with reports of massive egg mortalities and high-intensity infestations of nemerteans. The goal here was to determine the role of ""Carcinonemerteâ€‹s"" with respect to crab egg losses and evaluate its occurrence and impact over the range of the red king crab in Alaska. The role of ""C. regicides"" as an egg predator was established by laboratory observations including an experimental study of egg mortality in captive female crabs."
