13,Abstract:,"The Dungeness crab, Cancer magister, has traditionally been commercially fished in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. In recent years these stocks have declined while the Dungeness fishery of Alaska has increased. This symposium, the third in the Lowell Wakefield Fisheries Symposia Series, was convened to review the biology and management of the Dungeness crab in relation to its recent decline and to discuss prudent management of the fishery in Alaska. Sponsors of the symposium are the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, The Crustacean Society, and the Pacific Sea Grant College Program comprised of the Sea Grant programs at the Universities of Alaska, California, Hawaii, Washington, and Oregon State University."
