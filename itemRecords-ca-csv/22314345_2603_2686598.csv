7,Abstract:,"The Essential Principles and Fundamental Concepts outlined in this guide (inside) represent content that does not always fall neatly within particular disciplines. As a result, many Fundamental Concepts illustrate more than one Essential Principle. For example, Essential Principle 4 lists only three Fundamental Concepts; however, several others could be listed as well. This demonstrates the interdisciplinaâ€‹ry nature of ocean sciences. Educators can use these Fundamental Concepts to fulfill and go beyond the Next Generation Science Standards. They provide coordination, consistency, and coherence for ocean sciences education and are transforming the vision of ocean literacy into reality."
