9,Abstract:,"In recent years, the United States has begun to foster growth of a domestic seaweed aquaculture industry, with hopes that resulting food products may compete with those imported from larger Asian and European markets. However, due to a lack of applicable, federal regulation, states are left to determine how to regulate the sale of whole-form seaweed through their own statutes and administrative regulations, which  vary widely in scope, content, and applicability. Consequently, it is necessary to understand the differing elements of such state rules, as they can greatly impact the potential success of a commercial seaweed aquaculture operation. In response to this need, the National Sea Grant Law Center (NSGLC) conducted an inventory of applicable statutes and regulations in states that either currently permit commercial seaweed aquaculture or have taken steps to facilitate such in the future. In creating this report, the National Sea Grant Law Center identified eleven states with potentially applicable statutes and regulations—Ala​ska, California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington. NSGLC then compiled a list of rules that either relate to seaweed aquaculture explicitly, or are applicable due to a state’s inclusion of marine plants within its definition of aquaculture. This report does not list every potentially applicable rule, but instead includes those most relevant due to their scope, content, and/or applicability. Generally, the rules listed in this document relate to state licensing, permitting, and leasing structures governing commercial seaweed aquaculture along with any applicable enforcement provisions. Additionally, related definitions and outlying rules were included. Citations to listed statutes and regulations are included throughout the report."
