10,Abstract:,"Will a marine reserve increase a fishery's abundance outside its boundaries, and will that generate a sustainable increase in harvest sufficient to offset the losses associated with foreclosed harvest opportunities in the reserve? That is the question addressed in this paper. The authors identify circumstances in which the opposition to reserves by potentially displaced fishermen will be minimized, namely situations in which fishermen might actually gain from reserve creation. They lay out a simple bioeconomic model involving exploitation over space and use the model to analyze the implications of closing areas and establishing reserves."
