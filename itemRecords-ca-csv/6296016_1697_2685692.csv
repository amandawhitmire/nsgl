15,Abstract:,"The sudden appearance at the surface of an alongshore-​parallel band of red tide near Huntington Beach, California, is described in high spatial and temporal resolution using novel instrumentation including a global positioning system-tracked jet-ski. The scale of the surface chlorophyll a (Chl a) band was small (approx.. 200 m crossshore) and ephemeral (3 h) compared with the subsurface extent of the red tide (approx. 2 km, >7d). The red tide was dominated by the regionally common dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum (F. Stein) and had developed as a subsurface Chl a layer during the 7 d prior to the surface appearance. A few hours before the surface appearance, a subsurface patch of elevated Chl a (Chl a > 30 ug L^-1) was observed in 13-m total depth in the trough of a shoreward-​propagating internal wave, consistent with dinoflagellate vertical swimming interacting with the internal wave-driven convergence. Internal wave-​breaking-​induced vertical mixing in approx. 8-m water depth vertically spread the Chl a patch to the surface, creating the alongshore surface band approx. 500 m from shore. Both the subsurface Chl a patch and the surface Chl a band were prevented from entering the surf-zone by a density barrier of warm water adjacent to the beach. These high-resolution observations emphasize the role of nearshore physical dynamics in controlling the duration and intensity of red tide exposure to coastal habitats."
