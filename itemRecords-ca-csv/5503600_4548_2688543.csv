10,Abstract:,"Adequate oceanographic monitoring of environmental changes in both time and space is very difficult. Although ocean conditions may change dramatically in a few days, it may take weeks for a research vessel to sample an area of a few hundred squa re kilometers, and only scarce hydrographic measurements are available from ships and research platforms. The relatively new techniques of satellite oceanography hold great promise for solving such problems by allowing the monitoring of the upper ocean on various time and space scales. This paper describes the utilization of satellite remote sensing to detect environmental variability indicated by deviations in fish behavior and population structure. Several published U.S. west coast studies exemplifying this approach are reviewed. Some results from an investigation of albacore tuna distribution variability are also discussed as an example of the use of satellite-​derived information."
