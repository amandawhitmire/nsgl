12,Abstract:,"Data indicate a possible female-specific role for calcitonin during late stages of sexual maturation. As large changes in calcium metabolism occur during teleost female sexual maturation, a possible calcium-​calcitonin relationship must be cons idered during this period. 17beta-​estradiol (E2) induces liver-based synthesis of the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin. Large amounts of calcium bind to circulating vitellogenin; as the levels of circulating vitellogenin increase, so do the lev els of protein-bound calcium. This calcium demand is met by mobilizing calcium from internal reservoirs, such as scales and bone, and by increased calcium uptake from the environment. Thus during vitellogenesis, females may be at risk of becoming hypocalcemic in terms of the physiologically important free plasma calcium levels. The present study explores the physiological relationship between plasma E2 and calcitonin in salmonids and whether these hormones influence their plasma calcium st atus."
