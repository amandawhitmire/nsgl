10,Abstract:,"Scientists analyzed the time-series of remote-sensed surface chlorophyll concentration and its relevant hydrological and meteorological factors (sea surface temperature, atmospheric precipitation, air temperature, and upwelling index) in the Santa Monica Bay and adjacent waters off southern California from 1997 through 2001, using wavelet analysis and cross-â€‹correlation statistical methods. All parameters exhibited seasonal patterns of variations. Wavelet analysis revealed short-period variations of remote-sensed chlorophyll biomass during spring seasons. Long-term variations were evident in air temperature during El Nino and in wind stress during La Nina. Variations of chlorophyll biomass and sea surface temperature lagged 5-6 and 5-15 days behind the variations of wind stress, the latter being accompanied by coherent variations of air temperature. The mechanism of these variations was an intensification of phytoplankton growth resulting from mixing of the water column by wind stress and entrainment of nutrients into the euphotic layer."
