8,Abstract:,"Transport due to the movement of water is one of the most important processes governing the fate of constituents in a wetland environment, and a firm understanding of hydrodynamic processes is necessary to develop effective management strategies for wetland wastewater treatment. In this paper, the equations of motion describing 2-D unsteady free-surface flow in a wetland environment are derived from basic principles. A numerical model based on the time-centered implicit scheme is developed. The motivation for developing the model lies in the need for a well-written, structured code that can be easily incorporated as part of an optimization model to determine management strategies for wetland wastewater treatment."
