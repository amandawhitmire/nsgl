12,Abstract:,"Confusion in the taxonomy of economically important tropical and subtropical algae remains the single greatest obstacle to progress in Pacific seaweed aquaculture and marine natural products chemistry. In this illustrated volume, the third in a series, an international group of specialists representing the United States, Japan, China, Chile, Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Philippines describe the results of a workshop on the taxonomy of the groups ""Gracilaria"", ""Eucheuma"", ""Sargassum"" and the Gelidiales."
