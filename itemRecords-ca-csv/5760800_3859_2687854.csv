10,Abstract:,"Recent evidence suggests that viruses play an influential role within the marine microbial food web. To understand this role, it is important to determine rates and mechanisms of virus removal and degradation. In this study, decay of infectivity has been researched with both native and nonnative bacteriophage isolates, manipulated under various conditions. Results suggest that sunlight is an important contributing factor to virus decay but also point to the significance of particles and dissolved substances in seawater."
