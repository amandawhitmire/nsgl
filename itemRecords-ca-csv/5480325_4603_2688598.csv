9,Abstract:,"Before a natural resource can be exploited, one must know where it is. For some resources, forests, for example, this is not a big problem--it is easy to find the resource. For others, fish in the ocean, oil or mineral resources, and pests of agricultural crops, finding the resources is a major effort. It is for these resources that search theory can play a useful role, since search theory is essentially the applied mathematics of finding objects. After a brief history and taxonomy of search problems, the mathematics of search is discussed. This includes underlying probability distributions, the differential equations of search, Bayesian use of search information, and optimization problems in search theory. The theory is illustrated by applications in fisheries, pest control, animal foraging, and oil and mineral exploration."
