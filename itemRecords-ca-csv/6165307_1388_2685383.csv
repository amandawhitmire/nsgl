10,Abstract:,"Seasonal variability of water column methane concentrations, fluxes across the sediment-water interface, river methane concentrations, and aerobic methane oxidation rates were measured in Tomales Bay, a temperate estuary in northern California. Water column methane concentrations showed spatial and temporal variability (8-100 nM). Benthic fluxes were determined by two methods: direct measurement using benthic chambers and estimates from sediment core concentration gradients. Chamber fluxes varied from -0.14 to 16 umol m(^-2)d(^-1), and were elevated 56-100% over one-dimensional diffusive fluxes calculated from sediment porewater profiles, primarily as the result of macrofaunal activities and the presence of anoxic microenvironmen​ts. Benthic fluxes (approx. 50 umol m(^-2)d(^-1) measured in sediments vegetated with Zostera marina were considerably higher than fluxes measured at unvegetated sites. Net aerobic methane oxidation rates were determined by in situ experiments and ranged from -0.95 to 3.38 nM d(^-1). Methane concentrations in Lagunitas and Walker Creeks which feed into the bay varied annually (144-953 nM), and were a significant methane source to the bay during winter and periods of high stream flow. Loss of methane to the atmosphere and advective transport were estimated and utilized to construct a winter and summer methane budget for Tomales Bay. Export to the coastal ocean and benthic production were the dominant processes in the summer, while freshwater input, benthic production, and atmospheric evasion were dominant in the winter."
