12,Abstract:,"This study develops a spectral bio-optical model to predict in-situ primary production rates from optical properties of the water column, total daily irradiance, and wavelength-​dependent absorption properties of the resident phytoplankton. Estimates of primary production at three frontal stations are used to analyze the predictive capabilities of several variants of the spectral model to determine temporal and spatial patterns in primary production. The model permits calculation of primary production from shipboard observations and may be useful for predicting production rates from bio-optical data provided by untended buoys."
