8,Abstract:,"The research reported here investigates several aspects of genetic diversity in eelgrass mitigation. Specific objectives were to: (1) expand the assessment of whether transplantation results in reduced genetic diversity; (2) identify whether the transplantation protocol contributes to the reduction in genetic diversity; and (3) determine whether genetic diversity affects transplantation success. In addressing the third objective, the author focused on genetic effects on vegetative and sexual reproduction in eelgrass."
