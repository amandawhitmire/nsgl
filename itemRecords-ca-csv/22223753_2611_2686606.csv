9,Abstract:,"Island Explorers Unit One activities: start from the bottom, literally! Students are introduced to basic geology and plate tectonics so they have an understanding of how oceans form. The ocean floor can vary from smooth sandy bottoms to massive canyons and mountain ranges. In addition, coastlines and beaches form and change. Students will not only gain a basic understanding of these topics, but also learn how to map and present this information. Once the structure of the ocean is completed we start filling the ocean basin with water and investigate its unique nature. Waves, currents and tides are a major part of understanding how the marine environment works. Students will also investigate the special nature of water, sea water in particular. By participating in a variety of activities which focus on these topics the students will gain an appreciation and understanding of the physical aspects of the ocean. (Unit 1 of 4)"
