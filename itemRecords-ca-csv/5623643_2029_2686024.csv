10,Abstract:,"Two models, a spectral refraction model (Longuet-​Higgins) and a parabolic equation method (PEM) refraction-​diffraction model (Kirby), are used to simulate the propagation of surface gravity waves across the Southern California Bight. The Bight contains numerous offshore islands and shoals and is significantly larger (approx 300 km by 300 km) than regions typically studied with these models. The overall objective is to discuss the application of spectral refraction and spectral refraction-​diffraction models in engineering studies of the sheltering effects of islands and shoals over spatial scales of several 100 km."
