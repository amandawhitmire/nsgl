It highlights four ways in which New Hampshire Sea Grant has responded to the needs of coastal communities preparing for climate change. It also describes the results of responding to community needs, and emphasizes the outcomes from working in collaboration with a coalition of 19 local, regional, state and federal entities called the New Hampshire Coastal Adaptation Workgroup."
