19,Abstract:,"The growth hormone (GH)/insulin-​like growth factor (Igf) endocrine axis regulates somatic growth in the face of changing environmental conditions. In actinopterygian fishes, food availability is a key modulator of the somatotropic axis, with lower food intake generally depressing liver Igf1 release to diminish growth. Igf1 signaling, however, also involves several distinct IGF binding proteins (Igfbps), and the functional roles of many of these Igfbps in affecting growth during shifting food availability remain uncertain. Here, we tested how complete food deprivation (fasting) affected gene transcription for paralogs of all six types of Igfbps in the liver and fast-​twitch skeletal muscle of cabezon (Scorpaenichthy​s marmoratus), a nearshore marine fish important for recreational fisheries in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Juvenile cabezon were maintained as either fed (6% mass food⋅g fish wet mass−1 ⋅d−1 ) or fasted for 14 d. Fasted fish exhibited a lower body condition (K), a depressed mass-​specific growth rate (SGR), and reduced plasma concentrations of Igf1. In the liver, fasting reduced the relative abundance of gene transcripts encoding Igfbps igfbp2a and igfbp2b, while significantly elevating mRNA levels for igfbp1a, igfbp1b, igfbp3b, and igfbp4. Fasting also reduced hepatic mRNA levels of GH receptor-1 (ghr1) – but not GH receptor-2 (ghr2) – supporting the idea that changes in liver sensitivity to GH may underlie the decline in plasma Igf1 during food deprivation. In skeletal muscle, fasting downregulated gene transcripts encoding igf1, igfbp2b, igfbp5b, and igfbp6b, while also upregulating mRNAs for igf2 and ghr2. These data demonstrate isoformspecific regulation of Igfbps in liver and skeletal muscle in cabezon experiencing food deprivation and reinforce the idea that the repertoire of duplicated Igfbp genes that evolved in actinopterygian fishes supports a diverse scope of endocrine and paracrine functions."
