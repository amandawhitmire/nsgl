13,Abstract:,"The intention of our monitoring and research is to provide science-based information to all stakeholders involved in salmon and steelhead recovery. Our work would not be possible without the support of our partners, including several public resource agencies and non-profit organizations, along with hundreds of private landowners who have granted us access to the streams that flow through their properties. In this seasonal monitoring update, we provide results from our fall and winter field season, including results from coho salmon monitoring at PIT tag detection sites located throughout the watershed and from spawning surveys conducted through both Broodstock Program and CMP monitoring efforts. Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags and PIT tag detection systems (antennas and transceivers) are used to document status and trends of Russian River salmonid populations at both stream-specific and basinwide scales. From September 15, 2018, through March 1, 2019, our goal was to collect PIT tag data at multiple sites to document adult hatchery coho salmon return timing, estimate the number of returning hatchery coho salmon adults, and estimate coho salmon smolt to adult return (SAR) ratios in four Broodstock Program monitoring streams (Willow, Dutch Bill, Green Valley, and Mill). In addition, we were able to estimate these metrics for the Russian River basin overall with the exception of SAR ratios because we do not have the ability to estimate the number of smolts leaving the entire Russian River basin each year."
