17,Abstract:,"Fisheries researchers and managers will find invaluable the 28 peer-reviewed manuscripts in this book. The book is important because it exemplifies the recent advancements in understanding rockfish life history, population dynamics, age and growth, genetic population structure, and stock assessment. Improved knowledge on these topics should result in enhanced management and conservation, despite enormous challenges faced by rockfish researchers and managers. This volume is not only important to researchers, but also to a wider audience involved with fisheries oceanography, genetics, stock assessment, and fisheries management."
