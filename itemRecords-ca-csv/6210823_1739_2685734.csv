13,Abstract:,"Globally, fisheries have a profound impact on both population and community dynamics in marine systems. Traditionally, research and management have focused on understanding and minimizing the effects of commercial fishing. Though often overlooked, recreational fisheries can also have large impacts on natural systems. These impacts include direct affects (i.e. reductions of targeted stocks, bycatch, and pollution) as well as indirect effects (i.e. trophic cascades and ghost fishing)."
