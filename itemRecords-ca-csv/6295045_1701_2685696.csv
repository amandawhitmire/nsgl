9,Abstract:,"Several species of marine worms and crustaceans are routinely imported into California for use as live bait. The most common of these is the ghost shrimp (a translucent crayfish-like burrowing crustacean found in coastal mud flats along the West Coast). The goal of this project was to evaluate some of the potential risks associated with the live-bait trade, in terms of its potential to spread non-native bait species, their associated parasites, and ""hitchhiker"" species, which may be present in bait packing materials such as seaweed. A genetics study was also conducted to determine whether importing ghost shrimp from Washington and Oregon to California might ""genetically pollute"" southern populations."
