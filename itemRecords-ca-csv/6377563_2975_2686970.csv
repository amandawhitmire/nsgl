12,Abstract:,"The mud shrimp, Upogebia pugettensis, is a native suspension feeding burrowing shrimp that ranges from Morro Bay, California to Prince William Sound, Alaska that builds extensive permanent y-shaped burrows in intertidal estuary mudflats. Mud shrimp beds are prominent features of estuary mudflats and provide critical habitat for at least 15 commensal species. Populations of mud shrimp along the eastern Pacific have declined 18% per year or more in all inhabited estuaries over the last decade due to infestation by the introduced bopyrid isopod parasite, Orthoine griffenis. Bopyrid isopods cause blood loss and effectively castrate their hosts. This isopod is particularly effective at reducing Upogebia populations because they can reduce host fitness to zero without increasing host mortality. The largest remaining populations of Upogebia are on the central Oregon coast, and the Alsea Bay population is relatively unstudied. This assessment serves to establish a baseline description of the Alsea Bay Upogebia population by estimating abundance, spatial extent and biomass, and to determine the population dynamics such as size-frequency distributions and isopod infestation rates.Our results conclude that the Upogebia population in Alsea Bay is significant. These shrimp densely inhabit 22.9% in tideland in the estuary, with a total biomass of 404.4 +/- 157.8 metric tons. Infestation by Orthione griffenis is 38%, with females exhibiting much higher infestation rates. Describing this local Upogebia population will establish a baseline for continued monitoring in order to better understanding their decline and implement best management practices."
