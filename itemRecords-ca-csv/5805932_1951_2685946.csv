10,Abstract:,"The authors of this study characterized the overall process of seacliff erosion by mapping, observing, and quantifying intrinsically- and extrinsically-​related cliff erosion variables at eight San Diego County cliff sites and evaluating their relationship to long-term seacliff erosion rates. Quantification of seacliff resistance involved in- situ measurement of intact rock strength; measurement of the orientation, spacing width, and continuity of structural discontinuities​; and generalized evaluation of the significance of groundwater seepage, weathering, and fatigue. They evaluated the role of waves in eroding seacliffs through modeling and detailed observations. Findings reveal that waves are secondary to material properties in influencing the rate of cliff retreat."
