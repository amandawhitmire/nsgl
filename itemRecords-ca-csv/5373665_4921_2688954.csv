9,Abstract:,"Both biological and physical processes lead to the removal of dissolved and suspended materials from water that enters estuaries. Our understanding of these filtering functions in southern California estuaries is summarized in three concepts: (1) In this semi-arid region, ecosystems are highly seasonal so that both the biological and physical `filters' differ for wet and dry seasons. (2) Extreme events such as floods substantially modify estuarine structure and functioning. (3) When extreme events coincide with major human disturbances in the watershed, estuarine functioning is altered, and the changes can have long-term consequences for the ecosystem. These concepts should be regarded as working hypotheses that need to be tested."
