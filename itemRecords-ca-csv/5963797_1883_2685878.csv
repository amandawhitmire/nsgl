10,Abstract:,"Exploitation rates for legal-sized male Dungeness crabs ""Cancer magister"" often reach 90 percent in the northern California fishery, thus making large males crabs scarce and raising the possibility of reduced mating success particularly among large female crabs. The overall objective of this study was to determine whether sperm-plug presence is a reliable and accurate indicator of mating success in female Dungeness crabs. To achieve this objective, researchers characterized the temporal changes in sperm plugs based on internal examination of reproductive tracts of 135 female Dungeness crabs of known molting and presumed mating history ranging from 4 days to 323 days post mating. They found that sperm-plug presence could be reliably identified for at least 180 days post mating. They then used sperm plug presence to demonstrate that mating success of large, molting female Dungeness crabs in northern California during 1997 was close to 100 percent."
