11,Abstract:,"This manuscript outlines a protocol for using a freely downloadable fragment analysis software package (STRand) together with a 96+4 RapidLoad membrane comb to increase throughput of samples for fragment analysis on ABI sequencers without costly upgrades. The protocol is a major modification to those suggested by the manufacturer, and saves both time and money."
