11,Abstract:,"Pelagic, nonfeeding larvae of the red abalone (""Haliotis rufescens"") settle and subsequently metamorphose into benthic juveniles capable of feeding on particulate food. Metamorphosis must be fueled by either endogenous reserves or a nonparticulate food source such as dissolved organic material (DOM) in seawater. This study shows measurements of transport rates of amino acids and sugars by these animals, and such calculations of the energy input from these substrates, indicate that the cumulative transport of DOM from seawater during development of the early juvenile stage could supply an amount of energy equivalent to the initial maternal endowment of energy reserves to the oocyte of this nonfeeding species."
