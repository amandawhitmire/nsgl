13,Abstract:,"The Southern California wave climate is spatially complex due to the partial sheltering effects of the offshore islands and shoals and the nearshore influence of coastal submarine canyons. The wave prediction problem in the Bight is further complicated by the fact that relatively high resolution deep ocean directional spectra are required as input to the models. To address this resolution problem, a linear inverse technique has been developed which uses sheltered wave data and the previously mentioned wave propagation models to infer the shape of the deep ocean directional spectra. Applications of this technique to several historical wave events have been quite promising, but the method has been limited by the number and location of the wave data stations operating in the Bight. For this report, eleven pressure sensors were deployed throughout the Southern California Bight in two three-monthy experiments, designed to test numberical wave modeling techniques in this bathymetrically complex region."
