9,Abstract:,"The transition of freshwater-â€‹adapted juvenile (parr) salmon to seawater adaptable `smolts' is known as smoltification. Morphometric and hormonal data were collected from yearling coho salmon during a period when smoltification is presumed to occur. Changes in body shape, using multivariate statistical analyses of truss-network measurements, are described and related to variability in plasma thyroid hormone, thyroxine. In light of results reported herein, developing a simple, morphometric index of smoltification appears possible for coho salmon."
