9,Abstract:,"Two new species of nudibranchs from the coast of California. Okenia felis, from Monterey County, is white with six pairs of lateral appendages and a single medial papilla inserted into the notum on a broad base. This species is similar in appearance to Okenia japonica Baba, 1949, but it differs in consistent features of external, radular, and reproductive anatomy. Flabelllina goddardi, from the intertidal zone of Santa Barbara county, is externally most similar to F. pricei and F. pellucida have smooth lateral teeth, while F. goddardi entirely lacks lateral teeth. The species is compared to the other 15 Flabellina that have been recorded from the Pacific coast of North America."
