14,,"The focus of this third conference was on `nuts and bolts' issues. Small workshops were devoted to trapping, diseases, hatchboxes, instream structures, monitoring and erosion control. Papers and handouts from those sessions comprise the second half of this report. The first half includes papers on salmon enhancement in the future, stream evaluation for salmon projects, citizen-​oriented projects, and educational materials about salmon."
