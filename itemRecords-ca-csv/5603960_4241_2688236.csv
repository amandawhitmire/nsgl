11,Abstract:,"Cytoskeletal elements regulate a wide variety of cellular processes in plant development and function. For example, cytoplasmic microtubules and microfilaments have been shown to govern several aspects of cell growth, cell polarity, and cell cycle events in higher plants. This paper presents evidence that the early developmental events (germination, germ tube growth, nuclear translocation) in ""Macrocystis pyrifera"" gametophytes are temporally distinct and appear to be governed by discrete cytoskeletal elements. This appears to be the first demonstration of the role of cytoskeletal elements in cellular events during gametophytic development in a brown alga."
