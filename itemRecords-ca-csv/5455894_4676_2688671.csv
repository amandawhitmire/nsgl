9,Abstract:,"Herbivores differ from carnivores in intestinal adaptations for absorbing sugars and amino acids. Among vertebrate species eating their natural diets, the ratio of amino acid to sugar transport is highest for carnivores, lower for omnivores, and lowest for herbivores. These differences arise in two ways: from reversible adaptation to diet, by induction and repression of transport proteins, with a delay of hours or days; and constitutive genetic differences. Species that experience developmental changes in diet exhibit development changes in intestinal nutrient transport, those changes being `hard-wired' in the case studied here (monkey-face prickleback fish)."
