8,Abstract:,"Education and the integration of science based research into the management and use of marine resources is essential to insure their sustainable use and conservation into the future. The continual need for education as researchers make new discoveries requires a process that engages the research community, resource managers, and marine industries in a mutually beneficial partnership that guides research, and helps to solve problems faced by marine resource users. This paper will describe how the National Sea Grant Program's extension network is organized to address a broad spectrum of marine resources and engage user groups, managers, and industry. It will also describe through a series of examples how Sea Grant collaborates with other agencies, in particular the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service to improve aquaculture production in the United States. Both programs work primarily through the Land- Grant system at Universities throughout the country. The Land-Grant system, initiated by a series of legislative initiatives during the mid to late 19th and early 20th centuries, traditionally includes a Congressionally designated university (The 1862 and 1890 Morrill Acts) and corresponding Agricultural Experiment Stations (The 1887 Hatch Act), which generally house the states' Cooperative Extension Service (The 1914 Smith-Lever Act). Collectively, these units engage in teaching, research, and extension primarily to improve agricultural productivity, but also to help solve problems facing the nation's human and natural resources. Extension professionals within this system are responsible for engaging user groups and communicating science-based information to improve their lives and businesses. In addition to serving as a delivery mechanism for new information, those involved in extension constantly interact with their clientele as end users to identify areas where more research is needed and apprise the research community of these needs. This research-â€‹extension continuum is a hallmark of the Land-Grant system. The National Sea Grant College Program was established along this successful Land-Grant model by the 1966 National Sea Grant College and Program Act. The intent was to increase the understanding, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of the nation's ocean and coastal resources. Housed within the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA,) the National Sea Grant College Program ""Enhances the practical use and conservation of coastal, marine and Great Lakes resources to create a sustainable economy and environment."" What is unique to Sea Grant is that it engages top researchers at universities and delivers the results of their discoveries to end users through extension, education, and communication programs that are required components of a Sea Grant College Program. As with the Land-Grant system, Sea Grant is usually a partnership with Land-Grant universities and Cooperative Extension in coastal and Great Lakes states, and shares the same commitment to teaching, research and extension. Sea Grant invests in high priority program areas such as coastal communities and economies, coastal hazards mitigation, ecosystems and habitats, aquaculture, fisheries and seafood technology, marine biotechnology, the urban coast, and ocean technology. Educational components are incorporated into each of these thematic areas. The Sea Grant Extension Program's mission is to effect change through outcome-based education and demonstration. This mission is supported through the conduct of targeted basic and applied research. Extension professionals create opportunities for effective, two-way communication between producers and users of information and translate complex scientific information for decision makers and citizens. This facilitates the rapid transfer of scientific"
