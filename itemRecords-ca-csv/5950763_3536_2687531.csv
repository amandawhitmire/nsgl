12,Abstract:,"Recently, researchers learned that a charcoal sample from the Indian Sands site on the southern Oregon coast dated to 10,430 radiocarbon years, making it the single site from coastal Oregon to join a small number of Late Pleistocene Pacific coast sites in Alaska, British Columbia, and California. The long-term objective of their research is to determine parameters affecting human occupation of the Late Pleistocene on the southern Oregon coast. They seek to model landforms, climate, and the cultural ecology of the earliest coastal settlers. Among the issues the project addresses are the antiquity of maritime traditions and explanations for the paucity of old sites on the Oregon coast. This article emphasizes the findings at one specific site, plus the geoarchaeologicâ€‹al methods employed."
