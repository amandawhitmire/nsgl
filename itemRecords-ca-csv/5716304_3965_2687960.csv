10,Abstract:,"Biopolymers containing anionic and hydrogen-​bonding functionalities have recently been found in biosilicates. An improved understanding of the role of silicon in human tissues and of silica in bioactive-glass bone implants has also been realized. Laboratory silica syntheses have increasingly featured biomineralizati​on techniques, mild reaction conditions, biogenic and biomolecule-​like organic dopants, and biosilicate starting materials."
