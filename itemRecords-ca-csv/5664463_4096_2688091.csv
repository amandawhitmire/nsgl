10,Abstract:,"Cobalt is an essential nutrient required by all organisms. The geochemical cycling of cobalt (Co) has often been considered to be controlled by the scavenging and oxidation of Co(II) on the surface of manganese [Mn(III,IV)] oxides or manganates. Because Mn(II) oxidation in the environment is often catalyzed by bacteria, the ability of Mn(II)-​oxidizing bacteria to bind and oxidize Co(II) in the absence of Mn(II) was investigated to determine whether some Mn(II)-​oxidizing bacteria also oxidize Co(II) independently of Mn oxidation. Results revealed the direct binding and oxidation of cobalt by the Mn(II)-​oxidizing spores of the marine ""Bacillus"" sp. strain SG-1 in the absence of Mn(III,IV) oxides produced by the spores. The metal precipitation properties of ""Bacillus"" sp. strain SG-1 may have useful biotechnologica​l applications."
