13,Abstract:,"The Humboldt Bay Initiative seeks to bring people together to help envision the desired future state of the Humboldt Bay ecosystems, to help understand past, current and future conditions, and to move forward in the spirit of collaboration towards a sustainable and dynamic future. In order to address priority stresses to the ecosystems due to human activities, climate change, excessive sediment, and invasive species, the Humboldt Bay Initiative proposes a set of strategies that help create the conditions necessary for a shared vision of the future. Through an ecosystem-based management approach, the Humboldt Bay Initiative enhances integrated management to address these stresses with strategies to adapt to climate and coastal change, coordinate a response to invasive species, study and control sediment sources, promote sustainable community development, and ultimately support integrated forest management."
