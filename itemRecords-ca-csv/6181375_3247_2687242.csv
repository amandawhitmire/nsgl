10,Abstract:,"Actinomycetes are a group of bacteria that live in soil and decompose organic matter such as cellulose. In the realm of drug discovery, these microorganisms are widely recognized for their ability to produce secondary metabolites (chemicals) with commercially viable antibiotic activity. Streptomycin, the first treatment for tuberculosis, was derived from the largest genus of these bacteria, Streptomyces. Erythromycin and tetracycline are two other examples of common medicines derived originally from these microorganisms' metabolites"
