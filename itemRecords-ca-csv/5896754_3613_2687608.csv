18,Abstract:,"Scientists report here that scytonemin, a pigment isolated from cyanobacteria, is the first described small molecule inhibitor of human polo-like kinase. The activities exhibited by scytonemin indicate that it is a nontoxic, antiproliferati​ve agent and its unique chemical structure offers a potential scaffold that could be used to develop a new class of drugs for treating hyperproliferat​ive disorders."
