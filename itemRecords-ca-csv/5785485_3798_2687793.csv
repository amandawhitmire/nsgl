12,Abstract:,"The authors report the isolation and characterizatio​n of silica proteins form the occluded axial protein filaments of the siliceous spicules of the marine sponge ""Tethya aurantia,"" and the cloning and sequence analysis of the cDNA encoding silicatein ""alpha"". Evidence is presented supporting the suggestion that enzymatic activity is involved in biosilicificati​on in sponges."
