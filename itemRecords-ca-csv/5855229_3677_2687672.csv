11,Abstract:,"This study was conducted to ascertain how marine bacteria utilize peptidic chemical cues and hence influence the distributions of these compounds. Field-collected populations of estuarine bacteria were probed with glycyl- glycyl-​L-​arginine (GGR), a potent synthetic analog for the natural cue inducing settlement by oyster larvae. GGR is also an effective signal molecule for barnacle larvae and mud crabs and perhaps for other species. The rates at which bacteria removed GGR and the nonspecific adsorption of this peptide onto colloids were simultaneously measured. This information is vital to understanding the basic mechanisms that control the persistence of chemical signal molecules in marine habitats."
