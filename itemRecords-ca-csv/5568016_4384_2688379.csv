17,Abstract:,"Because vesamicol is proving to be an important tool in both biochemical and physiological studies of the cholinergic nerve terminal, researchers sought to understand its mode of action and to develop its potential further through a structure-​activity study. Eighty-four analogues and derivatives of the acetylcholine-​storage-​blocking drug ""trans""-2-(4- phenylpiperidin​o)cyclohexanol (vesamicol) were synthesized, and their potencies were evaluated with the acetylcholine active- transport assay utilizing purified synaptic vesicles from ""Torpedo"" electric organ. The parent drug exhibits enantioselectiv​ity, with (-)-vesamicol being 25-fold more potent that (+)-vesamicol. A potent benzovesamicol family has been discovered that is suitable for facile elaboration of the sort useful in affinity labeling and affinity chromatography applications."
