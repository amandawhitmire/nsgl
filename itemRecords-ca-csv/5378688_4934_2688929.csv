7,Abstract:,"Most of the work published concerning transport of free amino acids (FAA) in marine organisms has dealt with mechanisms of influx or net flux rates. A great deal of attention has been devoted to demonstrating the reality of net entry of FAA, and it is apparent that net uptake of FAA is a real and widespread phenomenon among marine invertebrates and algae. The intent of this contribution is to review work on the regulation of net entry of FAA into marine invertebrates and algae from the ambient seawater environment and to stimulate interest in studying the process."
