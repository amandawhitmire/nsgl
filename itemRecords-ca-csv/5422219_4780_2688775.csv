9,Abstract:,"It has been reported that fish with PKD (proliferative kidney disease) may encounter problems when transferred to seawater. To assess the effects of such transfers on the progress of PKD, parallel groups of infected juvenile chinook salmon were examined from the Numbus Hatchery held in freshwater or in full strength salt water. Salmon transferred to full strength seawater continue to show PKX cells and typical PKD in a pattern not dissimilar to cohorts in fresh water. Perhaps the most beneficial aspect of early transfers of chinook salmon to seawater is to arrest complicating bacterial and protozoan infections; this may prevent mortalities associated with PKD."
