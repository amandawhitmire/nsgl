11,Abstract:,"Planktonic cercariae (parasite larvae) of digenetic flatworms (""Himasthla rhigedana"") encyst up to 100% of intermediate host populations. Toward explaining such high prevalence, larval behavior and passive-​transport processes were evaluated experimentally for their roles in waterborne parasite transmission. Using a new application of laser and digital video imaging technologies, the authors quantified cercarial movements in still water and in simulated field flows. In still water, downward swimming in response to light, irrespective of intensity or source, and gravity brought larvae to the bottom three-times faster than gravitational sinking alone. The mean downward swim speed (0.59 cm/s at 24 deg. C) was three times faster than turbulent fluctuations indicating that cercariae overpowered eddies to reach the bed. Environmentally triggered downward swimming can thus quickly bring larvae to the bed. It is clear that vertical swimming identifies larval behavior, not passive transport, as the principal mechanism responsible for dispersal to host habitat."
