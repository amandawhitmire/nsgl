8,Abstract:,"The Chinese mitten crab (""Eriocheir sinensis"") is a burrowing crab whose native distribution is the coastal rivers and estuaries of the Yellow Sea in Korea and China. It has recently become established in the San Francisco Bay/Delta watershed in California, posing a potential threat to native invertebrates and to the ecological structure of freshwater and brackish estuarine communities, as well as disrupting some fisheries. Although not currently present in the Pacific Northwest, scientists predict that, like the European green crab it is likely to arrive in Oregon and Washington eventually through larval dispersal or intentional release. This fact sheet describes the mitten crab and its potential for detrimental effects on biological communities (including salmonids, sturgeon, and humans) and on fishing operations."
