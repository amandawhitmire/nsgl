9,Abstract:,"The natural history of abalones facilitates overfishing, and this has been a problem in every producing country. Abalones live in shallow water near stands of their algal food, in relatively predictable and accessible locations; the adults are virtually stationary. Furthermore, abalones have unpredictable recruitment and slow growth rates. In combination, these factors make abalones particularly susceptible to overexploitatioâ€‹n. Seeding is an appealing approach to abalone resource enhancement. Interest is also growing in seafloor farming, the leasing of state-owned bottom for cultivation of a seed `crop' by private enterprise. General considerations for abalone seeding, some of the techniques developed, experimental results from this research, and future directions for abalone seeding in California are discussed here and compared with the situation in Japan."
