10,Abstract:,"Several studies in the Southern California Bight have concluded that there are deleterious effects of sewage outfall discharges on benthic communities, but there is less conclusive evidence of impact on the water column. For this study, the spatial and temporal variability of transparency measured for 15 years at 7 stations near the San Diego sewage outfall has been investigated and compared to the temporal variablity of sewage suspended solid discharge and flow rate. Results lead to the conclusion that these anthropogenic properties are not affecting transparency, while natural factors such as seasonality and distance from coast do."
