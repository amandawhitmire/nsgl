11,Abstract:,"Control of pathogenic microorganisms is an important aspect of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety programs for the seafood industry. In HACCP protocols, most monitoring procedures need to be done rapidly because they relate to on-line processes. Microbial testing is seldom effective due to the time-consuming nature of the tests. Rapid assays for the microbial pathogens and maine toxins may be useful. The objective of this paper was to review commercially available test kits for food pathogens and to evaluate their usefulness to seafood HACCP programs. It is concluded they can be useful in some circumstances, but that new and better techniques still need to be found."
