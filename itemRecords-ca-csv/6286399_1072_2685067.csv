9,Abstract:,"Iron is one the most important and scarce micronutrients in the marine environment. To alleviate iron limitation, many marine bacteria produce siderophores, organic molecules that tightly bind iron and increase its solubility. We have previously shown that vibrioferrin (VF), a photoactive siderophore produced by algal-â€‹associated Marinobacter spp., greatly enhances iron uptake to both bacteria and phytoplankton in lab cultures via a photochemical reaction that generates soluble iron. To assess the effect of VF on phytoplankton and iron speciation in the marine environment, we measured the abundance of pvsB a biosynthetic gene of VF in the North Atlantic using real-time quantitative PCR. Surprisingly, VF biosynthetic genes appear to be ubiquitous in the North Atlantic and their vertical distribution suggests an adaptation to light that results from the photochemical features of this siderophore. These results highlight the importance of siderophore photochemistry and its potential impact on phytoplankton and the biogeochemistry of iron."
