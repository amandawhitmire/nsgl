11,Abstract:,"In his foreword to this history of oyster farming in the Pacific Northwest, Kenneth K. Chew of the University of Washington writes, 'the text and archival photographs offer an engaging portrayal of the significant events that have shaped the oyster industry in northern California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. This story is articulated capably by the authors, with intriguing input from archived literature and from old-timers who are still around and have reviewed the book for authenticity.' Eighteen recipes are interspersed throughout."
