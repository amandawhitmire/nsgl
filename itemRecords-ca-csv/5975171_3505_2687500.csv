13,Abstract:,"Biologists recently collected ""Ceramium interruptum"", ""C. sinicola"", and ""C. codicola"" in all reproductive stages from a littoral tide pool and subtidal zone in the northeast Pacific. Here they reassess their taxonomic ranks and determine evolutionary trends in cortication patterns and attachment modes of these three species as inferred from a comparative morphological study and three molecular data sets (plastid-​encoded rbcL, the RUBISCO spacer, and nuclear-encoded small subunit rDNA sequences)."
