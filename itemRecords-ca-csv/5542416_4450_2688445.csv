11,Abstract:,"Although the role of nitrogen is known to be significant in natural wetlands, there is little information on the nutrient dynamics of constructed salt marshes. This study showed that soil nitrogen pools were lower in a 4-year old constructed salt marsh than in an adjacent natural marsh of San Diego Bay. Aboveground biomass and foliar nitrogen content of ""Spartina foliosa"" were both lower for the constructed marsh, as was soil organic carbon. Fixation rates were higher for the natural marsh in surface soils (1 cm depth) but not in the rhizosphere (10 cm depth). In comparison with other natural marshes the San Diego Bay sites have low nitrogen pools and little soil organic carbon. Nitrogen mineralization rates were high in both marshes studied. The low nitrogen pools reflect low tidal import and infrequent streamflow influxes and, possibly, high nitrogen demands of vegetation stressed by hypersaline soils."
