9,Abstract:,"Coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") of the 1977 and 1978 brood years, while undergoing the smolting process in a hatchery, were exposed to a 5 X 10(-5) mg/L solution of morpholine for 41-42 days and then released into the Mad River, California. An unexposed group from each brood year was also released. During the 1979-1982 spawning seasons, when the treated fish were expected to return, morpholine was added continuously to the water in the Mad River Hatchery fish ladder to maintain a concentration near that to which the fish had been exposed. The significantly higher returns of morpholine-​exposed fish indicated that the coho salmon were imprinted on morpholine, and detected and responded to morpholine after living in the ocean for several months to 2 years. Results suggest that morpholine may be used to direct the migration of salmon to desired areas."
