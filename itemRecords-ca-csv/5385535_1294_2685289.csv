9,Abstract:,"""Strongylocentr​otus purpuratus"" in the Monterey Bay, California, area were used to examine the basic characteristics of disease in sea urchins. Bacteriological sampling of lesion material revealed the presence of 14 bacterial strains including ""Vibrio, Aeromonas, Flavobacterium"" and ""Pseudomonas""; only ""Vibrio anguillarum"" and ""Aeromonas salmonicida"" were able to initiate lesion formation in the laboratory. Experimental infectivity tests determined that a stress such as injury was necessary for the formation of a characteristic lesion."
