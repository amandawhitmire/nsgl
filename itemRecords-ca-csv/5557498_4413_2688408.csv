9,Abstract:,"In order for growth to occur, shrimp (and indeed all arthropods) must first periodically loosen the connectives between their epidermis and the extracellular cuticle, rapidly escape from the confines of this rigid cuticle, take up water to expand the new, flexible exoskeleton, and then quickly harden it with minerals and proteins for purposes of defense and locomotion. This review includes data on the molting (ecdysis) process obtained from a variety of decapod Crustacea. Historical aspects of the identification of the molting hormone and its metabolism are summarized briefly. Recent data concerning the in-vitro action of ecdysteroids and the regulation of the circulating concentration of the hormone by a neuropeptide are discussed, and preliminary studies that implicate the involvement of ecdysteroids in reproduction and embryonic development are described."
