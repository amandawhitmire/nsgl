10,Abstract:,"The ecological significance of differences in levels of toxicity as determined by laboratory toxicity bioassays was investigated for two species of marine sponges from a coral reef lagoon off Fiji. The palatability of sponge tissue was compared to fish meat, bread, and bread soaked in hand-squeezed sponge extract in field feeding trials. Sponge tissue was never consumed; the bread and meat were always consumed; and, the soaked bread was consumed to an intermediate degree. Results suggest that for prey with predators capable of relatively rapid learning, such as fish, palatability may be a more important defensive trait than toxicity."
