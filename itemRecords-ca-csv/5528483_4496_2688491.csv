9,Abstract:,"Natural and man-made chemical contaminants enter the aquatic environment through industrial waste and water runoff. Microscopic plants absorb the chemicals; small animals eat the contaminated plants, and fish eat the small animals. Large, flesh-eating fish contain larger amounts of contaminants than plant-eating fish because the contaminants are concentrated at each step in the food chain. Contaminants which can be found in some fish, as well as health advisories for sport fishermen issued by the California Department of Health Services, are detailed here."
