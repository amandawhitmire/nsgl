8,Abstract:,Southern California is often considered immune from the catastrophic flooding that periodically inundates the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the U.S. The generally mild weather and relatively sheltered coast supports this popular conception. However a series of severe winters (1977-78 and 1979-80) and the El Nino winter of 1982-83 have shaken the idea that this highly developed region is beyond threat. This report briefly reviews the large-scale and short-term conditions that lead to anomalously high sea levels in southern California.
