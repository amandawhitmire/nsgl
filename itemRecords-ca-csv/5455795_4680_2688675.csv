9,Abstract:,"""Pseudopterogor​gia"" species are among the most obvious invertebrates found on Caribbean reefs. Prior studies have shown this genus to be a rich source of cytotoxic compounds and anti-​inflammatory agents, and extracts of these animals produce significant feeding deterrence effects against carnivorous reef fishes. Extracts of a small, bushy ""Pseudopterogor​gia"" species which showed modest cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity were examined here and yielded four new bicyclic diterpenoid glycosides, the seco-​pseudopterosins A-D. The seco-​pseudopterosins are potent anti-​inflammatory and analgesic compounds related to pseudopterosin A, a metabolite from ""P. elisabethae""."
