12,Abstract:,"California Sea Grant, by virtue of the state's geography, history, and economy, has especially strong ties with the nations and states of the Pacific and a particular interest in the issues important to the region. Consequently, we are excited by the emerging sense of community apparent within the Pacific Basin—a region that has become one of the most dynamic growth areas of the world. We believe strongly that much of the vitality of California Sea Grant is derived from our international associations, from the flow of information and intellectual energy between colleagues of similar interests in and around the Pacific. For this reason, we have chosen to focus this 1984-85 summary report on our program's activities as they relate to the Pacific region. A few examples deserve special mention: • Marine Biotechnology, * Pacific Science Development, * Science Teacher Training, * Marine Resources Development, * Cross-Cultural Contact, and * Regional Sea Grant Activities."
