8,Abstract:,Spawning of eggs from the ovary of the penaeid shrimp into the surrounding seawater results in a dramatic and massive release of a jelly precursor from extracellular cortical crypts. This release is intiated by contact with seawater. The biochemical composition and physiology of the release of the precursors is still poorly understood. Reported here are new data on the physiological parameters involved in the egg jelly release and biochemical data on the composition of the released material.
