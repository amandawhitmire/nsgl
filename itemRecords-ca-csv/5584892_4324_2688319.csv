9,Abstract:,"Brood mortality of crustaceans is reviewed, with emphasis on Malacostraca. There is considerable variation in size-specific probability of egg loss. Patterns are discussed in terms of stock-â€‹recruitment relationships and with respect to life history theory; no significant patterns were found between taxa, habitats, climates or intensities of brood loss. The causes of brood loss are reviewed in sequence: from oviposition, fertilization and egg adhesion, through embryogenesis, to eclosion. Losses are most intense at oviposition or late in embryogenesis. The relative roles of mechanical losses, various diseases and egg predators is reviewed. Nemertean egg predators are often an important cause of mortality in decapod crustaceans. Fungal diseases of eggs are often a threat to cultured animals, but there is little evidence that they contribute substantially to egg mortality in nature."
