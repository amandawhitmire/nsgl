9,Abstract:,"Occluded proteins (called ""silicateins"") from the biosilica spicules produced by a sponge prove capable of directing the polymerization of silica and silsesquioxanes from the corresponding alkoxides under mild physiological conditions, whereas the anthropogenic synthesis of these materials typically requires acid or base catalysis. The author of this work discusses the prospects of identifying the structural determinants of the polysiloxane synthesis- directing activities, developing new environmentally benign routes to synthesis of more ordered silsesquioxanesâ€‹, and discovering the proteins, genes and molecular mechanisms controlling silicon metabolism in the sponge and other living systems."
