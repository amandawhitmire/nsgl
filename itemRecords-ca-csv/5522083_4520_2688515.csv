13,Abstract:,"Molluscs are known to concentrate many metabolites, some having interesting pharmacological and biological activities. From the digestive glands of the mollusc ""Aplysia dactylomela"" collected in the Gulf of Mannar of the Indian Ocean researchers record the isolation of nine compounds, and their structural elucidation. Two of the compounds are new, a selinane derivative and a 16,16-​dichlorohomolau​rane."
