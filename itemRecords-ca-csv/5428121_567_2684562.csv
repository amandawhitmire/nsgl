13,Abstract:,"The acoustic harassment device (AHD) was a logical outgrowth of the continuing battle between fishermen and marine mammals which prey directly on their catches and damage or destroy their gear. Ever-increasing regulations designed to protect the offenders, usually pinnipeds, as well as innocent incidental victims, have forced the development of a variety of nonlethal deterrents. The papers in this volume were presented at a workshop to review the results of six years' trials with the AHD. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. Psychoacoustics and pinnipeds. Charles F. Greenlaw, pp. 11-15. 2. Factors that may affect sound propagation from acoustic harassment devices. Jeanette Thomas, pp. 16-22. 3. An acoustic harassment technique to reduce seal predation on salmon. Bruce R. Mate, et al., pp. 23-36. 4. Evaluation of seal harassment techniques to protect gill netted salmon. Anne C. Geiger and Steven J. Jeffries, pp. 37-55. 5. Acoustic harassment testing in the San Francisco Bay Pacific herring, ""Clupea Harengus"", gill net and purse seine fisheries. Doyle Hanan and John Scholl, pp. 56-57. 6. Acoustic harassment testing in the Klamath River salmon fishery. Doyle Hanan and John Scholl, pp. 58-65. 7. Effects of cracker shells on California sea lions, ""Zalophus californianus"", interacting with the southern California partyboat fishery. John Scholl and Doyle Hanan, pp. 60-65. 8. Acoustic harassment and cracker shell tests in the southern California partyboat fishery. John Scholl, pp. 66. 9. Acoustic harassment devices tested in combination with cracker shells on Pinnipeds interacting with the southern California partyboat fishery. John Scholl and Doyle Hanan, pp. 67-74. 10. The feasibility and effectiveness of using an acoustic barrier to restrict the movements of seals into Netarts Bay, Oregon. James T. Harvey, et al., pp. 75-78. 11. Oregon Aquafood's experience with a seal avoidance system. Andrew Rivinus, pp. 79-80. 12. The use of acoustic harassment devices in Coos Bay at the Anadromous, Inc., saltwater recapture facilities. Tery K. Greenke and Dan VanSlyke, pp. 81-84. 13. Measurements of sound propagation from several acoustic harassment devices. Frank T. Awbrey and Jeanette A. Thomas, pp. 85-104. 14. Behavioral conditioning. Karen Pryor, pp. 105-110. 15. The design and operation of acoustic aversion devices: some notes. Charles F. Greenlaw, pp. 111-114."
