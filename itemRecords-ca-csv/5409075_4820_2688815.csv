10,Abstract:,"Quantitative studies evaluating the risk of ""Clostridium botulinum"" growth and toxigenesis as it relates to type of food, type and load of spores, as well as temperature and time of storage, are still lacking. Since knowledge of the time needed for a spore to germinate and reach numbers associated with detectable toxigenesis at a particular temperature is a key to the development of safe storage standards, this model study was undertaken to develop quantitative methodology which could estimate the probability (P) of ""C. botulinum"" growth in brain heart infusion-â€‹cysteine broth. Satisfactory approaches could then be expanded to real food systems."
