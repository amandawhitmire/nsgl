Unlike Its companion volumes, the 1980-81 and 1981-82 summaries, the biennial report presents the accomplishments of our program in the words of the project leaders who conducted the research. The information is not diluted or summarized — it is meant to be a technical record of our accomplishments for use by individuals in academia, government, and industry."
