13,Abstract:,"In summarizing the training aspects of the Sea Grant Project, a number of students have gained experience in planning specific research programs, and in obtaining, analyzing, and interpreting data of the sort useful in studying the biology of a marine fishery. All of the students have had extensive opportunities: (1) to use a number of standard ecological, fisheries, and oceanographic t​echniques; (2) to integrate laboratory and field work; and (3) to examine aspects of the biology of benthic and pelagic habitats. Their: contributions have added significantly both to the success of the project and to Our knowledge of the California spiny lobster. The Graduate Student Training included these project titles: Distribution, Population Dynamics, and-​Habitat-​Preference Studies of Juvenile and Adult Panulirus interruptus (Richard F. Ford and Stephen A. Serfling). Impoundment Studies of Tagging Techniques, Growth, and Molting Frequency in Juvenile and Adult Panulirus interruptus (Richard F. Ford, Anthony C. Roth, and David A. Farris). Recruitment, Habitat Preference> Growth, and Laboratory Rearing-​Studies of the Puerulus through Mid-​Juvenile Stages of Panulirus interruptus (Stephen A. Serfling). Social Behavior of Panulirus interruptus (Anthony C. Roth). Catch Analysis and Mark-Recapture Studies of Panulirus interruptus (David A. Farris). Investigation of Larval Populations (William E. Hazen and John Rutherford). Laboratory Studies of Panulirus interruptus Phyllosome Larvae (Deborah M. Dexter and Joan R. Mitchell)."
