12,Abstract:,"Declines in diversity among populations managed together have diminished aggregatestabil​ity through a decreased portfolio effect. Although the portfolio effecthas been quantified in a variety of ways, management recommendations for therecovery of lost diversity rarely specify the stability benefits possible through suchimprovement​s. We introduce a metric, the Diversity Deficit (DD), that relates past losses and potentialgains in aggregate stability to the changes in population diversity (i.e. covariabilityam​ong population time series). We illustrate the use of this metric inretrospective analyses of the aggregate Sacramento River Fall-run Chinook salmonstock (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and project potential future improvements instability through population diversity. In the retrospective analysis, we removed individual time series from the stabilitycalcul​ations to determine their effects on times and locations of past losses in diversityand stability. We found an early threefold loss in stock stability resultingfrom the presence of a single tributary, the Sacramento River mainstem. Othershifts in stability resulted from an increase in variability of a single population, andfrom the synchronizing effects of low ocean survival that led to the 2008–2009 fishery closure. Only one, smaller increase in the DD (i.e. in lost stability) was due toportfolio-​wide increases in covariabilities among tributary abundances. In a prospective analysis using the DD applied to California salmon, we found thatincreasing biodiversity to the point of population independence and to its earlyhigh value would have reduced the probability of triggering a fishery closure. Synthesis and applications. Analyses with the Diversity Deficit (DD) metric illustrate away to identify the times and locations of losses in population diversity, and toquantify how much restoration of population diversity could increase stability, andthus benefit resource services. In our research, the benefit was a reduction in theprobability of falling below a critical management threshold leading to fishery closure,but other tangible benefits (e.g. reduction in probability of extinction) wouldalso be possible."
