14,Abstract:,"The Oregon Coastal Zone Management Association's (OCZMA) Oregon Fishing Industry Project was conceived to help the Oregon fishing industry. The question of limited entry, or fleet versus resource as it is sometimes called, is one of the areas of interest for OCZMA's Oregon Fishing Industry Project. The entire project is concerned with stabilizing and revitalizing Oregon coastal communities. Certainly the topic of limited entry is one that is frequently discussed; it is a controversial topic and one that has polarized the thinking of many fishermen. There are some strong sentiments for limited entry and some equally strong feelings in opposition. The purpose of this conference was not to promote limited entry as a fishery management tool, but rather to provide industry members with an opportunity to listen firsthand to the comments of persons who have been directly involved with limited entry programs in their respective areas. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. Why are we talking about limited entry? R. Barry Fisher pp. 3-8. 2. What is limited entry? James A. Crutchfield pp. 9-14. 3.
