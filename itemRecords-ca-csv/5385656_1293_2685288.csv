9,Abstract:,"A time series of Coastal Zone Color Scanner images has been analyzed to gain a perspective on the ocean surface color field heterogeneity in central California near-coastal waters. In the identification of `open ocean', `transition' and `coastal' water types in the mean images, and comparison of values and areal extent in different periods and years, a distinct seasonality of the spatial characteristics of ocean color emerged; analogous seasonal cycles are evident in the variance images. Possible interpretations in terms of the oceanographic `climate' of the region are discussed as reflecting the combined effects of coastal processes and offshore mesoscale dynamics typical of the California Current System. A profound influence of the bathymetric relief on surface structure, even in deep ocean areas, is documented by the data set."
