10,Abstract:,"Oxygen consumption rates of white sturgeon (""Acipenser transmontanus"") were measured under commercial culture conditions. Mean fish size ranged from 0.09 to 3.8 kg. Mean daily values of oxygen consumption rates ranged from 70- 330mg/kg per fish/hr. Peak oxygen consumption rates were as much as twice the mean daily values and occurred in response to feeding for fish fed a ration of less than 2.6% body mass per day. With higher feed rations, peak oxygen consumption rates were a smaller percentage of the mean daily value. Multiple regression analysis showed that 93% of the variations in measured oxygen consumption rate values could be attributed to variations in feed ration."
