10,Abstract:,"This paper details the strengths and weaknesses of available data and proposes specific expansions to aid studies of human and organizational error (HOE) in the marine environment. Although closely targeted to the marine oil transportation industry and oil spills, it should be considered relevant to all marine activities involving hazardous materials. Applicability of data to the current research in loading and discharge operations (LDO) is noted; however, absence of LDO information does not necessarily imply that the data are not useful for HOE in other operations."
