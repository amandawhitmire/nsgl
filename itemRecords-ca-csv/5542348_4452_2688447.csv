10,Abstract:,"Metabolites of arachidonic acid are important regulators of biological function in a variety of mammalian tissues. Fish gills were investigated for their ability to generate dioxygenated metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The synthesis of an 8,15-diHETE by fish gill tissue homogenates is reported here; the inital oxygenation reaction is catalyzed by 15-lipoxygenase and the subsequent formation of 8,15-diHETE is catalyzed by 12-​lipoxygenase. The net balance of products formed was dependent upon the fatty acid substrate oxygenated, and the concentration of reduced glutathione."
