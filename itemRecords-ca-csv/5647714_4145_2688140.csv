10,Abstract:,"During copulation in ""Sicyonia ingentis"" the male transfers sperm to the female's seminal receptacles where sperm undergo capacitation to make them competent to undergo the acrosome reaction (AR) in response to egg derived inducers. Uncapacitated sperm removed from males bind to the vitelline envelope but do not undergo the AR so these sperm can be used to study primary binding. Capacitated sperm can be induced to undergo acrosomal exocytosis using egg water and can be used to study secondary sperm binding. In this system where primary and secondary binding can be readily separated, it was demonstrated that ""S. ingentis"" ova possess two distinct oocytic extracellular matrices, one involved in primary and the other in secondary sperm binding. Both of these extracellular matrices were isolated and the components involved in primary sperm binding were examined."
