9,Abstract:,"Marine biologists have shown unqualified support for managing fisheries with marine reserves, signifying a new resource management paradigm that recognizes the importance of spatial processes in exploited systems. Most modeling of reserves employs simplifying assumptions about the behavior of fishermen in response to spatial closures. The authors show that a realistic depiction of fishermen's behavior dramatically alters the conclusions about reserves. They develop, estimate, and calibrate an integrated bioeconomic model of the sea urchin fishery in northern California and use it to stimulate reserve policies. The model shows how economic incentives determine both participation and location choices of fishermen. They compare simulations with behavioral response to purely biological modeling and conclude that optimism about reserves may be the product of simplifying assumptions that ignore economic behavior."
