13,Abstract:,"A pantropic pseudotyped retroviral vector containing the envelope protein of vesicular stomatitis virus was used as a gene transfer vector in the dwarf surfclam, ""Mulinia lateralis."" Newly fertilized dwarf surfclam eggs were electroplated in the presence of colony-forming units of pantropic pseudotyped retroviral particles. Infection was well tolerated and did not affect the survival rate of the embryos. Gametes collected from P1 presumptive transgenic animals were analyzed for the presence of provirus by PCR, and in different experiments 13-33% of the gamete pools were positive for the transgene. Pantropic pseudotyped retroviral vectors provide a useful method for the stable introduction of foreign genetic information into surfclams and may facilitate the introduction of desirable genetic traits into commercially important shellfish and crustaceans."
