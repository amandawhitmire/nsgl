10,Abstract:,"Encouraging educators to adopt novel teaching methods that foster a sense of environmental stewardship among their students is the theme of a video developed by the Sea Grant programs of the University of Hawaii and the University of Southern California. An innovative environmental education program, called the ""Adopt A Beach School Assembly Program,"" is highlighted. The purpose of the video is to introduce educators to a new means of integrating classroom education and hands-on learning through community service. The program shows how students discover that they can make a difference in the world in which they live through recycling and community involvement. A resource list of easily accessible marine and environmental education materials is included as part of the video."
