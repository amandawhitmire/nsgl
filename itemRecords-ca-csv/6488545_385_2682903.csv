11,Abstract:,"Ecosystem-based fishery management (EBFM), while not mandated by legislation, has become a widespread goal in U.S. fisheries management, and in accord the Pacific Fisheries Management Council has initiated EBFM approaches in the waters of Washington, Oregon, and California (PFMC 2007, 2013), i.e. those of the California Current System (CCS). Forage species have been one of the primary focuses of these efforts and have attracted the attention not only of fishery agencies but NGOs as well (Oceana 2011, Pikitch et al. 2014, PEW 2013). In the past, management policies have given attention to individual forage species deemed to be particularly important to CCS food web dynamics, e.g., anchovy management plan (PFMC 1978), prohibition of a shortbelly rockfish fishery in the groundfish management plan (PFMC 2000, Field et al. 2007), and the recent prohibition on commercial (other than incidental) take of euphausiids (PFMC 2008). More recently, fishery managers have been placing importance on establishing a more complete understanding of predator-prey relationships involving forage fish. In addition, the California Fish and Game Commission has recently (2013) adopted policy guidelines toward progressively incorporating Essential Fishery Information (EFI) for ""ecosystem-​based management of forage species, including physical factors, oceanographic conditions, the effects of fishing on forage species' dependent predators, the availability of alternative prey, spatio-temporal foraging hotspots for predators, and existing management schemes, including marine protected areas (California Fish & Game Commission 2013). The State of Washington, Department of Fish and Wildlife, has also been active in encouraging such an ecosystem approach in marine fisheries management"
