11,Abstract:,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration'​s (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) hosted a stakeholder workshop in San Diego, California, on May 10-11, 2011, to discuss the future of the U.S. west coast swordfish (Xiphius gladius) fishery, including the under-​utilization of this marine resource and the excessive reliance on swordfish imports by U.S. consumers. The implications to coastal communities, protected living marine resources, and seafood consumers were also considered in the two-day event."
