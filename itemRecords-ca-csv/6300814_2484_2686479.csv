15,Abstract:,"We have previously reported that local climatic forcing in southern Kaneohe Bay, Oahu affects the biogeochemistry and gas exchange between the ocean and atmosphere. Specifically we have demonstrated, through high frequency time series data obtained from our instrumented CRIMP-CO2 buoy and synoptic sampling, how rainfall events that generate pulses of nutrient and sediment rich water exert a strong control on primary productivity and local carbon cycling. Our study also revealed that physical dynamics impart strong controls on gas exchange. Our study has now expanded to examine reef environments in Hawaii that are subject to a broader variety of biogeochemical and physical forcing mechanisms and are less impacted by direct land runoff. We report here results derived from a network of three buoys. These include the CRIMP-CO2 buoy that was re-deployed to the barrier reef of central Kaneohe Bay and two new buoys that were deployed on the south shore of Oahu in June 2008 as part of the Hawaii Ocean Observing System (HIOOS). Large differences in pCO2 have been observed at each of the three locations relative to our prior study in southern Kaneohe Bay. These differences reflect largely the impact of the physical forcing in the different environments in which the buoys are deployed, but also reflect the impact of sources of material to each site that affect carbon cycling, including photosynthesis, respiration and calcification. Results to date indicate that pCO2 at the three sites varies substantially from a narrow range of of 350 to 440 �atm at the Kilo Nalu site exposed to open ocean wave action, 360 to 470 �atm at the Ala Wai site which receives diluted riverine runoff and is also exposed to open ocean wave action, to a much broader range of 300-1000 �atm at the protected barrier reef site in Kaneohe Bay. These results confirm our prior assertion that extensive time series observations at different reef locations will be necessary to obtain reliable estimates of regional CO2 fluxes in tropical reef environments."
