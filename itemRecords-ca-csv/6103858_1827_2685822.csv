12,Abstract:,"The distribution of the introduced European green crab, Carcinus maenas, was investigated in the central California embayments of Bodega Bay Harbor (BBH), Tomales Bay, and Bolinas Lagoon using baited traps and snorkel surveys. Adult green crabs were very spatially limited in all three embayments and occurred primarily in warm, shallow areas that lacked large native Cancer spp. crabs. The green crabs that were found in closest proximity to populations of Cancer spp. exhibited high levels of limb damage and loss; damage was strongly correlated with low ratios of intertidal area: edge, indicative of narrow areas of intertidal that are more easily accessed by large Cancer spp. moving up to forage during periods of tidal inundation. Up to 70% of the green crabs tethered in areas of BBH that are utilized by Cancer spp. experienced limb loss, while those tethered in the marsh, where there are no Cancer spp., were undamaged. The results suggest that the potential distribution of green crabs in the northeastern Pacific will be far less than has been predicted, and that their impacts may be largely attenuated through predation by and competition with native crab species."
