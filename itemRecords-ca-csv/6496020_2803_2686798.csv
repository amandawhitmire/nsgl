11,Abstract:,"High phosphorus loading is a major problem in the Great Lakes watersheds. Phosphate enters waterways via both point and non-point sources (e.g., runoff, tile drainage, etc.), promoting eutrophication, and ultimately leading to algal blooms, hypoxia and loss of aquatic life. Quantification of phosphorus loading is typically done using the molybdenum blue method, which is known to have significant drawbacks. The molybdenum blue method requires strict control on reaction time, involves toxic reagents that have limited shelf-life and is generally unable to accurately measure sub-micromolar concentrations. This study aims to develop a novel reagent that will overcome many of these problems. Ethanolic europium(III) chloride and 8-​hydroxyquinolin​e-​5-​sulfonic acid (hqs) were combined to form the bis-hqs complex (Eu-hqs). Eu-hqs was synthesized as the dipotassium salt via a simple one-pot procedure. This complex was found to be highly fluorescent (λex = 360 nm, λem = 510 nm) and exhibited a linear response upon addition of monohydrogen phosphate. The linear response ranged from 0.5 - 25 μM HPO42- (15.5 - 775 μg P L-1). It was also determined that Eu-hqs formed a 1:1 complex with phosphate. Maximum fluorescence was found at a pH of 8.50, and few interferences from other ions were found. Shelf-life of the reagent was at least one month, twice as long as most of the molybdenum blue reagent formulations. In the future, field tests will be undertaken in local rivers, lakes, and wetlands to determine the applicability of the complex to real-world analysis."
