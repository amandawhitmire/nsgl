10,Abstract:,"In the marine shrimp ""Sicyonia ingentis,"" ova lack cortical vesicles at spawning. Previous studies suggested that two different populations of cortical vesicles (dense vesicles and the ring vesicles) appear within 30 min post-spawning. These vesicles undergo sequential exocytosis that leads to the formation of a hatching envelope around the ovum. In this study, lectins were used as molecular probes to study the development of cortical vesicles subsequent to spawning and the role of these vesicles in formation and elaboration of the hatching envelope. The data demonstrated that (1) ring vesicles are formed by fusion of cisternal elements containing ring-shaped structures; (2) the two species of cortical vesicles are chemically heterogeneous; and (3) the components of each type of vesicle contribute to different integral parts (the outer and inner layers) of the hatching envelope."
