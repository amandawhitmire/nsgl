12,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacological effects of two bioactive diterpenoid glycosides isolated from the sea whip ""Pseudopterogor​gia elisabethae"", pseudopterosin A and pseudopterosin E. Results suggest that the mechanism of ""in vivo"" analgesic and anti-​inflammatory activity of the pseudopterosins results as a consequence of ""in vivo"" inhibition of eicosanoid release."
