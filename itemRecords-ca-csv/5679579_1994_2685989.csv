11,Abstract:,"Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins and domoic acid are naturally occurring marine toxins that are powerful nerve poisons. PSP toxins and domoic acid have no taste or odor. There is no visible difference between toxic and safe seafoods, and cleaning seafoods in many cases will not remove the toxins. Cooking does not destroy the toxins. Monitoring programs and tips for consumers are described."
