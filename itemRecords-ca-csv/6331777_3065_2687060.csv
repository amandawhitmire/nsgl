9,Abstract:,"Scientists have identified 117 new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for detecting the genetic relatedness of Chinook salmon. The most basic genetic variation possible, a SNP (pronounced ?snip?) refers to a single difference in one base pair of a nucleotide. The major outcome of this project is the identification of an optimal panel of 96 SNPs that is capable of detecting both the parentage of hatchery-born Chinook and the origin (i.e., stock) of Chinook caught off California and Oregon."
