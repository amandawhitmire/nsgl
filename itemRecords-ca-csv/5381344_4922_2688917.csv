11,,"A new, rapid and sensitive bioassay for paralytic shellfish toxins was developed using the fly as the transvector. Reliability of the assay was demonstrated by repeated calibration studies with saxitoxin; the ED50 (50% effective dose), determined by various individuals varied by 20%. Test results were compared with those of the mouse bioassay and HPLC. The fly bioassay can measure toxicity levels below the threshold of the mouse bioassay method. In addition the actual concentration of PSP in any given sample reported in micrograms/100 g shellfish meat was higher for the fly than the mouse, due to the Schantz `salt effect' which does not affect the fly assay."
