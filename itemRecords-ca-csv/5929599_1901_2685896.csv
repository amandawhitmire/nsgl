10,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study was to examine variations in the structure of owl limpet ""Lottia gigantea"" populations over regional and local scales in urban southern California habitats, where human presence is high and the ecological influence of American black oystercatchers is absent or negligible. An additional goal was to determine whether regional urban Marine Protected Areas protect owl limpets and support population size structures characteristic of those from unexploited habitats."
