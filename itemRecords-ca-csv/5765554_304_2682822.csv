16,,"A wide variety of issues affecting ocean and coastal management are addressed in this two-volume, 1,756-page collection of conference papers. Major topics include: coastal economics, coastal processes, ports and vessel traffic safety, oil and gas development, oil spill prevention and response, marine managed areas, habitats and ecosystems, fisheries management, water quality monitoring, governance and public policy, technology development, education, and public participation. Seven common themes were identified: communication, collaboration, consensus, integration, investigation, and implementation, indicating that similar processes are needed to resolve these diverse issues."
