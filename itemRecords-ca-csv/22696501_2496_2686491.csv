11,Abstract:,"Endocrine control of molting in decapod crustaceans involves the eyestalk neurosecretory center (X-​organ/sinus gland complex), regenerating limbs, and a pair of Y-organs (YOs), as molting is induced by eyestalk ablation or multiple leg autotomy and suspended in early premolt by limb bud autotomy. Molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), produced in the X-organ/sinus gland complex, inhibit the YO. The YO transitions through four physiological states over the molt cycle: basal in intermolt; activated in early premolt; committed in mid- and late premolt; and repressed in postmolt. We assembled the first comprehensive YO transcriptome over the molt cycle in the land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis, showing that as many as 23 signaling pathways may interact in controlling ecdysteroidogen​esis. A proposed model of the MIH/cyclic nucleotide pathway, which maintains the basal YO, consists of cAMP/Ca2+ triggering and nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP summation phases. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is required for YO activation in early premolt and affects the mRNA levels of thousands of genes. Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGFβ)/Activin signaling is required for YO commitment in mid-premolt and high ecdysteroid titers at the end of premolt may trigger YO repression. The G. lateralis YO expresses 99 G protein-coupled receptors, three of which are putative receptors for MIH/CHH. Proteomic analysis shows the importance of radical oxygen species scavenging, cytoskeleton, vesicular secretion, immune response, and protein homeostasis and turnover proteins associated with YO function over the molt cycle. In addition to eyestalk ganglia, MIH mRNA and protein are present in brain, optic nerve, ventral nerve cord, and thoracic ganglion, suggesting that they are secondary sources of MIH. Down-​regulation of mTOR signaling genes, in particular Ras homolog enriched in brain or Rheb, compensates for the effects of elevated temperature in the YO, heart, and eyestalk ganglia in juvenile Metacarcinus magister. Rheb expression increases in the activated and committed YO. These data suggest that mTOR plays a central role in mediating molt regulation by physiological and environmental factors."
