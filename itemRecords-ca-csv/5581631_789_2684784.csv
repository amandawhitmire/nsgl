11,Abstract:,"A panel of marine biologists, commercial and sport fishermen, and aquaculture industry representatives was assembled to review the black abalone mortality occurring in Southern California. Panelists included those who had been documenting the decline and researching the cause, other experts in marine biology, physiology, and ecology, and industry and sport representatives​. In addition, industry members and scientists with knowledge of abalone biology or invertebrate population declines were invited to participate. The first half of the workshop included presentations on the history of abalone decliens, and research on the cause of the current mass mortalities. The second half of the workshop was devoted to developing key questions and possible research strategies, while a group addressed the question of what management actions could be taken to conserve abalone resources and maintain or restore productive fisheries and mariculture businesses in California."
