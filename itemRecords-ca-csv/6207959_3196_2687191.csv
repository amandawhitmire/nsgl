7,Abstract:,"With the decline in wild fish stock due to over fishing, habitat loss and the increased demand for fish as a food source, the aquaculture industry has become an important component in the global economy not only in a consumable goods sense but also as a means of stock replenishment through release programs. Capture fisheries reached their maximum sustainable yield of 100 million metric tons (MMT) more than ten years ago, and the demand for seafood has shown no signs of abating (FAO 2004). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations' annual report states that in 2002, aquaculture supplied 29.9% of the global supply (FAO 2004). In aquaculture, fish are commonly reared in net cages, ponds, tanks, and raceways. Aquaculture systems are typically designed to optimize water quality, which results in flow parameters that may not be optimal for growth. Fish with increased growth rates reach marketable size faster and with a higher proportion of muscle mass. A faster growth rate also allows individuals to more rapidly achieve a size suitable for over-wintering in tanks, possibly decreasing the high mortality seen in fingerlings in aquaculture. This would lead to decreasing the release time, enhancing the stock replenishment, and decreasing the holding costs to the hatchery. The early rearing conditions have a substantial influence on muscle growth and proliferation of muscle fibers (Johnston 2001a) making exploration of growth conditions for early juveniles an attractive area of focus for aquaculture. Continuous swimming during rearing improves growth rates (Davison 1997; Yogata and Oku 2000; Martin and Johnston 2005), enhances aerobic potential (Farrell, et al. 1991; Martinez, et al. 2003), and in some cases reduces stress (Young and Cech Jr. 1994b; Davison 1997; Milligan 1997) in a variety of fish species. The rigor of the exercise regime in terms of speed and duration is an important factor in these studies, because optimal conditions vary greatly by species and because excessive exercise can result in lower growth rates or increased stress (Kieffer 2000). The activities of glycolytic and oxidative enzymes are often used as indicators of anaerobic and aerobic metabolism in fish. Studies have shown that these enzymes positively correlate with growth rates, locomotory habits and food availability and as more recent studies have shown sustained exercise (Somero and Childress 1980; 1990; Pelletier, et al. 1995; Buhr 2002). Such metabolic enhancement may translate into improved performance or survival in fish released or transferred into net pens, where current flows may occasionally exceed velocities encountered during aquaculture. Growth in fish is largely controlled by hormones. Both environmental and nutritional factors indirectly influence growth by affecting the release of these growth hormones. This is especially true for ectotherms like teleost fish, which rely on temperature, photoperiods, and food availability to trigger developmental processes. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and growth hormone (GH) are two fundamentally important anabolic factors in fish. Pituitary GH stimulates liver production of IGF-I. IGF-I then directly stimulates tissue growth and mediates much of the growth promoting effects of GH. As exercise produces the same somatic growth enhancement as optimal feeding conditions (Pierce, et al. 2005), it is reasonable to suspect that sustained swimming will exert its effect through the IGF-GH axis. Reducing stress is critically important for health management in aquaculture. Although acute stressors can elicit a coordinated set of behavioral and physiological responses enabling the animal to overcome the strain (fuel mobilization, fight or flight response), chronic stress leads to negative effects on important physiological systems, including immunosuppressi​on (Wendelaar Bonga 1997; Barton 2002). Since excessive exercise can result in increased stress (Kieffer 2000), it is important to establish optimal swimming conditions specific for each fish species."
