10,Abstract:,"Located on the boundary between a rising ocean and a growing populace, coastal strand ecosystems are losing ground to widespread activities, such as beach grooming and seaside development. The ecosystem services and functions provided by these dynamic coastal ecotones have no analogs, yet are profoundly threatened by the combination of sea level rise and ongoing losses to human activities. We investigated the role of beach grooming in the loss of coastal strand ecosystems using field surveys and experiments. On groomed beaches in southern California, unvegetated supralittoral zones were four times wider than on ungroomed beaches. The cover of macrophyte wrack was nearly an order of magnitude lower on groomed beaches. Native plant abundance and richness were 15 and >3 times higher respectively, on ungroomed beaches than on groomed beaches. We seeded experimental plots in groomed and un-groomed sections of San Buenaventura State Beach, Ventura, CA, USA to test for differences in performance of coastal strand plants. Experimental comparisons of native plant performance were consistent with survey results: although initial germination was similar, seed bank, survival and reproduction were significantly lower in groomed compared to ungroomed plots. Physical processes varied between experimental plots in the groomed and ungroomed areas. In short term field trials, aeolian sand transport rates in seeded plots were ten to 1,000 times higher in groomed than ungroomed sections. Further, native coastal strand plants and kelp piles greatly reduced sand transport rates on short time scales (0.5 to 1 hour), causing a>90% reduction of rates upwind by 1 meter, in the center and immediately downwind of the plant or wrack deposit. Our results suggest beach grooming impacts ecosystem processes resulting in widespread conversion of coastal strand and dunes to unvegetated unstable sand sheets and the loss of protective dune formation. Conservation of these threatened coastal ecosystems could help retain sediment and maintain biodiversity, wildlife and human use in the face of rising sea levels."
