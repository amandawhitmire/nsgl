10,Abstract:,"A two-day meeting was organized to consider critical research needs in the living marine resources subject area. Presentations and discussions focused on research associated with the living resources of kelp forests, a rich and complex community that occurs along much of the California coast. Abalone and sea urchins, which form the basis of important commercial fisheries within the state, were subjects of particular concern. At the end of the meeting, each of the participants submitted a list of research topics that he or she felt were critical. These were distributed to a working committee whose job was to pull the statements together into a comprehensive research agenda. This document is the result of their work."
