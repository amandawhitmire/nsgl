9,Abstract:,"This paper examines changes in the bivalve community of Mission Bay, San Diego, California. Two quantitative historical datasets on bivalves in the bay are used along with additional sampling and experimentationâ€‹, to: (1) assess temporal trends in the subtidal bivalve community, (2) compare the bivalve community of the salt marsh tidal creek in the mid-1960s and mid-1990s, (3) test experimentally the hypothesis that the effects of ""Musculista"" on some dominant bivalves are consistent with observed long-term population trends of these species, and (4) examine the bivalve colonization of a newly-created tidal creek."
