11,Abstract:,"Since 1975, the USC Sea Grant Graduate Student Trainee Program has offered students the opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to actual working situations. In this program, students work on marine-related research under the direction of faculty members on selected Sea Grant projects. The program accomplishes several objectives: 1) It provides qualified students with the opportunity to work under the direction of experienced faculty members. 2) It provides students with marine research projects that help graduate research requirements for their degrees. 3) It provides Sea Grant principal investigators with qualified students who will substantially contribute to research results. 4) It provides students with experience in their chosen fields to help prepare them for leadership roles in the research and development of marine-related topics."
