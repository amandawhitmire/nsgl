17,Abstract:,"Communities and their residents are exposed to various natural hazards like flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis. In order to mitigate the potential damages, people have developed engineering models to predict damages to infrastructure. Economic models are also developed to assess disruptions of economic activities and how this disruption transfers to neighboring area, causing indirect impacts. However, the two models do not integrate well due to the availability of the economic data: economic data are typically collected at the county, place level. In an Input-Output (IO) accounting matrix, the highest resolution is zip code level which still does not correspond to the spatial extent of the natural disaster and cannot be used to assess the indirect impact. In this paper, we propose a method that allows us to spatially disaggregate an IO accounting matrix for one jurisdiction into two sub-county regions with an arbitrary geometry assocated with the spatial extent of natural hazards. In this way, we build the connection between the infrastructure damage and econnomic disruption in the area directly hit by the disaster and thus improve the integration between engineering and economic model. Then, we develop an integrated engineering-​economic vulnerability assessment model to evaluate the potential damage from natural hazards both in the area directly hit by the hazard and in the neighboring area that is economically interconnected. Existing studies have been focusing on disasters affecting one or several infrastructures instead of weather events that cover a spatial extent (Rose and Liao 2005; Lian and Haimes 2006; Crowther and Haimes 2010). When a weather induced disasters, past studies have tried to compromise by studying sectors separately (Crowther et al. 2007), or assuming the disaster-​affected regional boundary coincides with jurisdiction boundary (Crowther and Haimes 2010). However, the spatial extent of the direct physical damage from a natural hazard can be irregular in shape. For instance, in the case of a tsunami, the damage can spread over the the coastal landscape and affect numerous sectors simultaneously. Moreover, the damage will not necessarily coincide with jurisdiction boundary at which existing social economic data are collected. The lack of economic transaction data across a spatial boundary defined by a geologic or weather event lies in the core of technical complexity for disaster resilience analysis. Yamano et al. (2007) is the only article that tried to disaggregate an IO model into sub-county regions. In order to get ""economic grid data"" on a spatial resoultion of 500 m2 grids for Jyogo prefecture, Japan, they use only employment data and ""assume that the labor productivity is uniform across the districts in one prefeture for each sector"", which is too strong an assumption and in conflict with the input requirement table in IO Model. In this paper, we address the engineer-​economic integration issue and build a vulnerability assessment tool that enables us to evaluate the potential damage from natural hazards both in the area directly hit by the hazard and in the neighboring area that is economically interconnected. The assessment tool is applied to Clatsop County, a coastal Oregon county, subject to high risk of tsunami. According to Groat (2005), coastal communities from northern California to southern Canada are exposed to a 10-14% chance of a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and a 37% chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the next 50 years. We use the potential extent of tsunami as an example and illustrate how to disaggregate Clatsop County, Oregon into two sub-county regions: inside and outisde of innudation zone. With proprietary data on business location and economic activity, and making standard assumptions about cross-boundary trade, we estimate cross-regional trade without data on economic transactions between the innudation zone and upland and inland territory outside the innundation zone. In the first step, our engineering collaborators estiamte the direct economic damage from a simulated tsunami event using a widely used tsunami model. The engineering model is spatially explicit and can predict the spatial distriubtion of the key physical variables that can predict building damages, including water depths and velocity for all areas within the inundation zone. This generates predictions as shown in Figure 1(a). We then overlay this spatial distribution of physical variables with the spatial distribution of the building structures, which is plotted in Figure 1(b).i Using an engineering tool called ""fragility curves"", we combine the information of the physical forces and the building structure on each taxlot and predict the physical damage using the fragility curves. This generates the probability of damage for each taxlot. We then use this probability to calculate the expected damage in sales on each taxlot. Finally, utilizing the business location data and the North American Industry Classifcation System (NAICS) obtained from the Business Analysis of ESRI,ii we are able to estimate how the damage is distrubed across sectors in the innudation zone.This provides an estimate of the direct damage due to tsunami, but neglects the indirect impact on the businesses outisde the inundation zone who are buying and selling goods and services to the inside of the inundation zone. In the second step, we estimate the indirect damage of tsunami. To do so, we first need to understand how the businesses inside and outside of the inundation zone are interacting with each other. We start with the transaction table for Clastsop County, OR from IMPLAN, using the geocoded dataset including business locations and demographic distribution, we are able to construct a sub-county multi-regional IO model under general assumptions like no-​crosshauling, In our case, the two regions in the multi-regional IO model are irregular in shape. In the exemplary case, the two sub-regions are respectively the inside and outside of the innudation zone in Clatsop County. Then we use the estimated direct economic damage by sector from the first step as a shock on a two-region subcounty IO model to assess the indirect impact of tsunami on the rest of the county economy. The IO model is used because it is still the most commonly used tool in the impact analysis for natural disasters. A prelimnary engineering-​economic analysis of a major tsunami event has been completed with an 11-sector two-region (inside the innundation zone and outsider the innundation zone) IO model for Clatson County. Because the IO model exclude the substitutabilit​y and treat prices as fixed, it is probably a good analysis tool to estimate the immediate impact after the tsunami. But it may not work well as a analysis tool for medium to long term forecasts, because it tends to underestimate the resilience of local economy. The reason is that local businesses will look for find substitutes and adapt to price changes due to shortages after tsunami. We are currently working on an impact analysis using the computable general equilibrium framework first proposed by Rose and Liao (2005). Then we can compare the simulation results from these two approaches. We believe that the method proposed in this paper is quite general and can be easily adapted to other places and for the impact analysis of other natural disasters."
