11,Abstract:,"In this paper, the saltmarsh communities identified by Outhred and Buckney (1983) and Adam, et al. (1988) are analyzed. The results of prerestoration sampling at Kooragang Island are presented, exploring spatial variability between and within saltmarshes. To determine whether the various sampling areas could be considered replicates of a single community, plot-to- plot similarities were examined and positively associated species were determined. In search of evidence that species were interacting, researchers evaluated the correlation of cover estimates between pairs of co-occurring species."
