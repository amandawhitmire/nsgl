12,Abstract:,"Changes in the sterol composition of an extruded diet revealed that juvenile crayfish, ""Pacifastacus leniusculus"", require at least 0.4% (dry weight) of dietary sterols for survival. A mixture of plant-derived sterols is as effective as an equal amount of cholesterol in partial satisfaction of the requirement. The experimental diet, composed primarily of unrefined feedstuffs, has been used in intensive culture; growth was comparable to that achieved with a natural food diet composed primarily of vegetables and fish. The extruded diet can be formulated from readily available ingredients and should serve as a prototype for either intensive nursery or pond culture."
