11,Abstract:,"The authors' interest in this worm was kindled by an extensive parasitological examination of shore crabs in Europe to detect and evaluate potential natural enemies of the shore crab for possible use as biological control agents where this crab is an introduced pest. Here, they synthesize the past literature (most from the original French) and report new information on the habitat, abundance, host specificity, site specificity, size- specific prevalences, frequency distribution among hosts and effects on host growth of this fascinating parasite."
