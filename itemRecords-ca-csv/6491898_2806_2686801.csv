11,Abstract:,"Lake Erie is biologically the most active among the Great Lakes and experiences frequent large scale algal blooms during the summer period. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) such as Microcystis aeruginosa have been documented and these are of great concern for human health and are detrimental to the lake's biodiversity. Therefore, efficient lake monitoring tools are required for early detection and forecasting purposes. Satellite remote sensing is an efficient tool with high spatial and temporal coverage that can allow accurate and timely detection of HABs. However, in optically complex aquatic environments such as the Western Basin of Lake Erie (WBLE) where multiple color producing agents (CPAs) including phytoplankton, suspended sediment, and dissolved organic carbon are present the recorded spectra represent a convolution of the spectral responses from multiple constituents and the discrimination between the various constituents requires separation of the mostly overlapping scattering and absorption properties. This presents a challenge to the application of remote sensing data for determining a single in-water constituent. To assess the controls on the optical properties in the lake, we conducted weekly research cruises, collecting samples and conducting in-situ spectroscopy from a total of 90 stations that encompass many of the environments in Lake Erie ranging from deeper waters, shallower bay waters and riverine discharges. First-​derivative of the hyperspectral data clearly revealed known spectral features of phytoplankton, a primary constituent in the WBLE, which include absorption minima near 560 and 700 nm attributed to the minimum absorption capacity and fluorescence effects, respectively. The signal also extracted the red absorption peak due to chlorophyll-a (a proxy used for phytoplankton density) near 675 nm. Attenuation effects due to dissolved organic matter, detritus and suspended inorganic matters are also evident in the spectral signatures. This study focuses on improving the quantification of chlorophyll a and total suspended matter (TSM), by adopting bilinear factor models to link the various CPAs to their respective VIS/NiR spectral signatures. Spectral matching between extracted spectral signature and reference spectra indicated the CPAs that govern the optical properties of the WBLE namely, cyanobacteria associated with green algae, diatoms associated with phycocyanin from the blue-green algae, and inorganic clays. Independent validation data revealed that the models can predict chlorophyll a and TSM in the WBLE with R2 of 0.75 and 0.89, respectively. The RMSE for these models are 18 % for chlorophyll-a and 25 % for TSM."
