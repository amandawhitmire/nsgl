15,Abstract:,"Long-term (1992-present) water quality monitoring records reveal that the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in Massachusetts Bay (MB) exhibits a seasonal cycle with insignificant interannual variability. A multi-domain nested coupled physical-​biogeochemical model was developed with an aim at identifying the key mechanisms controlling the temporal/spatia​l variability of DO in MB. Built on good agreement between model results and observations, an EOF analysis indicates that DO variation in MB is dominated by seasonal and spatial varying modes, with the highest value occurring in March-April and lowest in October, and varying more significantly in the southern bay earlier in phase than in the northern bay. Although biogeochemical, advection and mixing processes vary year to year, their net contribution to DO variation remains relatively small (~ 10%) on an interannual basis. However, the dominant processes that control DO variation in the northern and the southern bay are significantly different. In the northern MB, horizontal advection, which is connected to the upstream Western Maine Coastal Current (WMCC), plays an important role in the DO variation. In the southern MB, particularly within Cape Cod Bay (CCB), a well-defined local retention mechanism results in a longer residence time, and the DO variation is more controlled by local biogeochemical processes."
