11,Abstract:,"Marina del Rey, California Is an entirely manmade, smalIcraft recreational harbor which was created In 1960-1962 from lands that were at one time a part of the Ballona Creek wetlands. The major threats to water quality in Marina Del Rey (as identified in this up-dated baseline survey) are the Oxford Flood Control Basin, Ballona Creek and Ballona Lagoon. Engineering solutions are needed to divert the Oxford Flood Control Basin drainage from the inner marina, an area with very low flushing capability. Pollutant input from Ballona Creek can probably only be remedied by better source control. Ballona Lagoon requires a clean-up and subsequent pollution control enforcement. Structural modifications to produce better flushing would alleviate most problems and are essential if the marina is to be enlarged.Â A program of sampIing and environmental measurements In Marina Del Rey, California was carried out by Harbors Environmental Projects (HEP) of the University of Southern California during the months of May through July and September through November of 1984. The results were compared with data from earlier HEP studies conducted In the Marina In 1976 through 1979, Insofar as possible, and are summarized in the executive summary."
