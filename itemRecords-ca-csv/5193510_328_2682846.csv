15,Abstract:,"This working paper is one of a series focused on the Marina del Rey being prepared as part of the Coastal Zone Planning and Management Project at the University of Southern California. The overall project has been conducted jointly by the Center for Urban Affairs and the Graduate Program of Urban and Regional Planning under a grant from the U.S, Department of Commerce to the U.S,C. Sea Grant Program. This paper was undertaken to provide an orderly, accurate presentation of the decision process which has led to the Marina's present status. We believe that the study will he of value to the Los Angeles County Department of Small Craft Harbors in its future Marina development activities. Obv​iously, there are many aspects of the Marina which we have not investigated in depth here. Among these are current activity patterns, developer behavior, environmental conditions, effects on surrounding areas, and the internal governance of the Marina. Furthermore, it has not been our intention to identify individuals who have advocated various policie​s. Other papers in the series will deal with many of these factors."
