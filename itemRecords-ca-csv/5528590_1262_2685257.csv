10,Abstract:,"This paper reviews the impacts of oil operations on the commercial fishing industry in California, utilizing the results of a recent survey of commercial fishermen. Reported impacts include not only the typical area displacement effects reported in other oil/fishing conflict cases, but the unleashing of a chain of events which affects fishermen working in other locations as well as fish processors whose supply sources and markets may be disrupted. Both public and private efforts to mitigate negative effects on the fishing industry have been made, with mixed results. In conflict cases involving publicly owned resources and pitting contestants of unequal power, private mediation should not become a replacement for, but only a supplement to, public decison-making."
