11,Abstract:,"Production in vitro of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBP) by various organs of the striped bass was examined by organ culture. Striped bass IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 were detected only in liver. IGFBP-2 was present in media from liver, pituitary, trunk kidney and bulbus arteriosus, and was detected occasionally in media from optic lobe of the brain, ceratobranchial cartilage, ceratobranchial bone, heart, spleen, gonad and gut. Although stripe bass IGFBPs may not directly correspond to mammalian IGFBPs of similar molecular weight, multi-organ IGFBPs may not directly correspond to mammalian IGFBPs of similar molecular weight, multi-organ IGFBP production appears to be an evolutionarily-â€‹conserved mechanism in vertebrates, evident in both teleosts and mammals."
