11,Notes:,"SEE: CASG-R-10-049. This was originally submitted in 2008 as an author's 33 page manuscript with the title: ""Riparian seedling mortality under simulated water table declines, and applications to river restoration."" It should have been put in as a peer-reviewed reprint rather than a technical report. The digital was never provided to the NSGL and could not be located. However, two years later it was published as a 2010 peer-reviewed reprint with the same Sea Grant Project Number."
12,Abstract:,"Seasonal water limitation exerts a strong ecological filter on stream communities in semi-arid regions. For riparian willow and poplar tree seedlings, desiccation resulting from rapidly declining river flows following seed germination can limit reproduction. We investigated survivorship of first-year riparian seedlings to simulated river stage declines, focusing on the three dominant species in California's San Joaquin Basin: Fremont cottonwood, Goodding's black willow, and sandbar willow. Seedlings grown in mesocosms were subjected to water table decline rates typical in spring on unregulated and regulated rivers. We compared the species' differences in survival time and fit the empirical data to accelerated failure time (AFT) models that predicted time until death as a function of drawdown rate, initial seedling size and maternal line. We used AIC to select the most parsimonious model for each species. Water table decline rates ≥6 cm/day were fully lethal to all species, whereas ≤1 cm/day had no effect compared to a stable water table (>63% survival). At an intermediate rate (3 cm/day) survival varied most among species (12-38%) and was lowest for cottonwood. The best failure time models included drawdown rate as the single parameter for willows, and rate and initial size for cottonwood. Across the range of survivable drawdown rates (≤4 cm/day), Goodding's black willow sustain >20% higher survivorship over the other species after 30-40 days of stage decline. Using AFT model results we simulated survivable flow scenarios on the regulated Tuolumne River (CA) in wet years that did not increase the overall discharge volume. This approach can guide flow releases along regulated rivers to promote large-scale habitat restoration, influence plant community dynamics, and balance ecosystem needs with growing human demand in the some of the world's most water-limited regions."
