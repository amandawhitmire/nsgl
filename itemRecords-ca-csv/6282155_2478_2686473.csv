13,Abstract:,"One of the principle means of sediment transfer from land to ocean in a small subtropical watershed occurs via freshwater pulses associated with intense but often abrupt orographic rainstorms. The rugged topography of the Hawaiian Island chain presents an opportunity to observe the behavior of storm-derived terrestrial mass transport. As urbanization extends its reach inland, storm events can also exert a particularly strong influence on the mobilization of anthropogenic material. We have established a network of stations in streams of a high-relief watershed on southern O'ahu, Hawai'i to evaluate the short-term and annual variability in material transport to estuaries and coastal ocean. A second network of stations has also been recently erected to monitor streams in another high-relief watershed on windward O'ahu. Because lower reaches of these streams intersect areas of varying urbanization (e.g., Honolulu, Kane'ohe), we can examine temporal and spatial variations of storm-derived material and the ever-increasing effect of anthropogenic contribution as it traverses through the watershed. The primary goals of our study are to characterize storm-derived mass fluxes of material delivered to the near-ocean and to resolve natural and anthropogenic contributions during its transport. Heavy metal concentration in both dissolved and suspended phase, as well as the isotopic composition of Pb, exhibit variations during storm events. Although the bulk of sediment mobilized is derived from the relatively unimpacted mountainous regions of the watershed, rapidly changing hydrographic conditions also mobilize urban contributions from ""street runoff"" and older watershed soils containing ""averaged"" anthropogenic input. The anthropogenic signal for Pb and Cd is very distinct from the dominant natural signal, but less apparent for other heavy metals. The presentation will largely focus on the geochemical variability of trace elements in the southern O'ahu watershed with preliminary findings from the windward O'ahu site also discussed."
