14,Abstract:,"The Bight Bulletin is a bilingual newsletter addressing water quality, coastal watersheds and habitats. The goal of the newsletter is to provide a mechanism for information exchange in the Southern California Bight for local, state and federal officials, educators, students, and non-​governmental organizations working towards reducing the impact of pollution and habitat loss on the coastal environment. This is a joint effort of the San Diego Association of Governments, the California Sea Grant College Program, with additional support from the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, and the Direccion General de Ecologia Estatal de Baja California. Some topics of interest in these issues: Mexican and U.S. Oceanographers collaborate to address pollution, by J. Largier, R. Durazo, and F. Ocampo;Baja California still free of the invasive marine alga Caulerpa toxifolia, by L.F. A. Rosas and R.A.
