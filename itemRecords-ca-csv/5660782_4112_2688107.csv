11,Abstract:,"Earlier studies in stellate sturgeon, ""Acipenser stellatus"", and Russian sturgeon, ""A. gueldenstaedti""​, demonstrated an elevation of gonadotropin during final oocyte maturation and spawning. White sturgeon, ""A. transmontanus"", has two distinct sturgeon gonadotropins, stGTH I and stGTH II. The former may be responsible for regulating initial gonadal development, while the latter is thought to control final gonadal maturation and ovulation/sperm​iation. The regulatory role of gonadal steroids on stGTH synthesis and secretion has not been elucidated. In this series of experiments, the effects of exogenous testosterone treatment on pituitary and plasma concentrations of stGTH I and stGTH II were assessed. In addition, some juvenile white sturgeon were also injected with a GnRH analog known to induce stGTH release in mature white sturgeon, and the effects of this combined treatment were also evaluated."
