12,Abstract:,"The eggs of most animals are surrounded by one or more egg coats which sperm must traverse to achieve fertilization. Some of these investments can be penetrated by the swimming force of a motile sperm, while others, such as vitelline envelopes (also termed vitelline layers or coats) or chorions, are impenetrable to such force. To better understand how decapod sperm gain access to the egg researchers examined the mechanisms by which sperm penetrate the egg investment of the shrimp, ""Sicyonia ingentis"". This study used protease inhibitors to show that sperm penetration of the vitalline envelope is due to the activity of a sperm trypsin-like protease(s)."
