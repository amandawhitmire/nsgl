10,Abstract:,"A peptide was isolated and purified from sinus glands of the lobster, ""Homarus americanus"", that was able to decrease circulating titers of ecdysteroids and increase the molt interval of eyestalk-​ablated juvenile lobsters. This molt-inhibiting activity was demonstrated to consist of two very closely related peptides by means of high-​performance liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis​. By means of amino acid analyses, a molecular weight of approximately 8700 was obtained."
