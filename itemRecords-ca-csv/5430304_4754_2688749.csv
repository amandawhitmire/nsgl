11,Abstract:,"The ability to induce a complete acrosome reaction (AR) in sperm removed from ""Sicyonia ingentis"" female seminal receptacles and incubated in isolated egg products enabled us to investigate the ionic requirements of the AR's second phase, acrosomal filament formation. This paper: (1) describes the ""in-vitro"" induction of a complete AR using egg components; (2) presents data suggesting that the sperm possess a high intracellular pH and that a pH decrease is associated with the second phase of the AR; and (3) suggests that the outward movement of K+ ions is involved in the pH drop."
