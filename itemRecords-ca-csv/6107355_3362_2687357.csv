11,Abstract:,"This workshop summary justifies and guides a coordinated national commitment to human dimensions research critical to prevent and respond to impacts of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Beyond HABs, it serves as a framework for developing human dimensions research as a cross-cutting priority of ecosystem science supporting coastal and ocean management, including hazard research and mitigation planning. Measuring and promoting community resilience to hazards require human dimensions research outcomes such as effective risk communication strategies; assessment of community vulnerability; identification of susceptible populations; comprehensive assessment of environmental, socio-cultural, and economic impacts; development of effective decision support tools; and improved coordination among agencies and stakeholders. This document charts a course for human dimensions research to achieve these and other priorities through coordinated implementation by the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology (JSOST) Interagency Working Group on HABs, Hypoxia and Human Health; national HAB funding programs; national research and response programs; and state research and monitoring programs."
