11,Abstract:,"The monthly tributary pollutant loads to the Great Lakes are estimated and used to identify management strategies in response to the joint U.S.-Canada Boundary Waters Treaty. Preliminary results of a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport simulation designed to synthesize the loads at Lake Erie's edge are summarized, and compared to those calculated by the operational load estimation procedure. Also discussed are modeling procedures, simulation conditions, and initial load error estimates."
