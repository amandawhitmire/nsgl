10,Abstract:,"The relative timing of postvitellogeni​c oocyte changes in the ridgeback prawn (""Sicyonia ingentis"") was studied using a simple ovarian biopsy technique. The technique had no significant effect on survival, number of spawns, time of spawning or egg quality compared with unsampled controls. The timing of the cortical specialization stage, the germinal vesicle breakdown stage and ovulation were studied using repeated ovarian biopsies. It was concluded that the frequency of cortical specialization stage oocytes was an accurate index of spawning activity."
