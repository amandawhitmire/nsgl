12,Abstract:,"Amemiya (1928) identified a distinct variety of the Japanese or Pacific oyster, ""Ostrea gigas"" var. ""sikamea"", in Ariake Bay, Japan. Differences in shell morphology, salinity tolerance, growth rate and egg size were the basis of Amemiya's characterizatio​n of the variety. The genus name for cupped oysters was subsequently changes from ""Ostrea"" to ""Crassostrea"". The biological and taxonomic separation of the Pacific oyster ""Crassostrea gigas"" from the Kumamoto oyster ""C. sikamea"" is affirmed by three concordant lines of evidence: (1) fixed differences in 2% of a mtDNA sequence coding for large subunit rRNA; (2) a genetic distance of 0.440 based on 19 allozyme loci, including 5 diagnositc loci; (3) one-way gametic incompatibility resulting in partial reproductive isolation in interspecific crosses. ""C. gigas"" sperm X ""C. sikamea"" egg fertilizations form viable hybrid offspring, but ""C. sikamea"" sperm do not fertilize ""C. gigas"" eggs. Divergence between these two species is mediated by differing peaks in the periods for gamete release and by one- way sperm/egg incompatibility​. Two attempts to recover ""C. sikamea"" from its place of origin in southern Japan have yielded only individuals with the mitochondrial haplotype that characterizes ""C. gigas"". We thus identify a crucial need for careful screening, management, and conservation of the cultivated populations of ""C. sikamea"" on the US west coast."
