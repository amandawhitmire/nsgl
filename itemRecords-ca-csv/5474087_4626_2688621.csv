8,Abstract:,"Entry of small organic molecules directly across the external epithelium of soft-bodied marine invertebrates represents net influx of substrates such as glucose and amino acids in most instances. Although this has been assumed, strict demonstration of net entry was contingent on recent advances in analytical chemistry. Such net influx often takes place in the presence of concentration gradients which are remarkably steep, particularly in the case of free amino acids. Many questions concerning epidermal transport in invertebrates have not been studied or remain unresolved. There is an active controversy concerning the extent to which epidermal transport is followed by translocation of solutes to deeper tissues, and there are no studies of the mechanism of translocation from the epidermis after uptake. This review recounts what ""is"" known, and suggests some directions for future studies to take."
