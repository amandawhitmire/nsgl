11,Abstract:,"A collaborative University-â€‹Industry White Sturgeon Broodstock Development Program was established in California eight years ago to obtain information on sexual maturation of captive sturgeon and to help the industry in developing broodstock reproductive management. The life cycle of white sturgeon is currently closed in captivity, and domestic offspring are now being used for commercial grow out. However, broodstock management remains a difficult task, due to the longevity of the sturgeon reproductive cycle and complexity of spawning procedures. Details of this program are discussed."
