12,Abstract:,"Participants at a workshop on 'Salinity Management in the Coastal Ocean' identified sensor stability and biological fouling in the field as the two main impediments that new technologies must address. Testing is underway of a new commercially developed sensor geometry that allows for the use of various innovative anti-fouling techniques in an inductive type conductivity sensor. The new sensor has been designated the Non-External Inductive Conductivity Sensor (NXIC). An experiment using a combination of anti-fouling paint applied both internally and externally with mechanical isolation of the conductivity sensor worked well to prevent fouling. After retrieval there was extensive fouling on the external portions of the system where anti- foulant was applied, but no fouling was evident on the sensitive interior bore areas of the conductivity sensor. Additional tests are to come."
