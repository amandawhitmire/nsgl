10,Abstract:,"As a class, terpenoid metabolites are useful chemotaxonomic markers because of their structural complexity and unique biogenetic origins. Five collections of the tropical seaweed ""Stypopodium zonale"" were analysed for ten secondary metabolites. Shallow water populations from the Caribbean were found to possess similar metabolite profiles from year to year and from widely diverse locations. ""S. zonale"" from the South Pacific had a profile qualitatively and quantitatively dissimilar to the Caribbean algae. A deep water Caribbean form of ""S. zonale"" was found to contain two metabolites not observed in the other extracts."
