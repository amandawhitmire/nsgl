12,Abstract:,"How healthy is that salt marsh?"" Sea Grant biologists are examining certain kinds of parasites infecting marsh snails to answer this question. They have shown that the collection of parasites inside snails reflects the diversity of animal life at the marsh and hence can be used as an index of wetland health. Put simply: the more parasites in snails, the healthier the marsh. This conclusion is based on what is known about the life cycles of the parasites they are studying. These trematodes, also known as flukes, must sequentially infect certain hosts, beginning with snails. Then, depending on the species, they go on to infect ""intermediate"" hosts such as crabs or fish. Usually, however, the life cycle begins in snails and ends in birds."
