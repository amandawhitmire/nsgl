14,Abstract:,"Managing pelagic shark stocks requires information about the movement patternsand fisheries interactions of all age classes, including young-​of-​the-​year (YOY; age-0), which, formany species, is particularly scant. This study investigated the vertical and horizontal movementsof YOY blue sharks Prionace glauca and shortfin makos Isurus oxyrinchus in the Southern CaliforniaBight (SCB) ecoregion using pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) and fishery data. Geolocationesti​mates from PSATs (n = 5 for each species) occurred entirely within the SCB ecoregion andexclusive economic zones of the USA and México (mean tracking period: 46.1 ± 24.8 d). YOY bluesharks spent 96.4% of their time at <40 m depth (60.4% <2 m) and exhibited reverse diel verticalmigrati​on (greater nighttime depths). YOY shortfin makos spent 97.0% of their time at <40 m(24.8%<2m) and exhibited a ‘midday dip’ of 5−10m below the surface, centered around solar noon.These differences in vertical movements likely reflect foraging tactics. Additionally, ob server datafrom the California drift gillnet fishery suggest juvenile blue sharks and shortfin makos move seasonallyalong the coast, northward from late summer to early fall and southward from late autumnto early winter. Age classes for both species exhibited latitudinal segregation, with smaller bluesharks and larger shortfin makos found farther north. The SCB ecoregion has long been regardedas a nursery area for both species; however, our data, in combination with previous studies, suggestthis important habitat is much more extensive, comprising the highly productive continental marginsspanning approximately 27.7−46.2°N for blue sharks and 23.4− 34.5°N for shortfin makos."
