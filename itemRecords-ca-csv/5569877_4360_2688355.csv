11,Abstract:,"There have been several extensive studies which intercompared various compact directional wave measurement systems, including pitch-and-roll buoys, slope arrays, and PUV gauges with both electromagnetic (EM) and acoustic travel time (ATT) current meters. In this study a field verification is presented of an alternative compact measurement system, an acoustic Doppler current meter developed to measure horizontal orbital wave velocities. Acoustic Doppler velocity measurements have several advantages over conventional nearshore wave measurement systems. Unlike EM and ATT current meters, the AD sample volume is not in close proximity to the instrument itself. Hence, distortion of the measured flow field by the instrument is avoided, and in principle very accurate measurements, potentially useful for studies of weak nonlinear effects on surface waves, can be obtained."
