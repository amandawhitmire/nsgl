8,Abstract:,"The author discusses three moments in history that shape much of our thinking now. The first goes back nearly a century, and concerns the origins of the modern ecosystem vision in fisheries science. The second involved the post- World War II institution of a unique research program on the California Current ocean region. The third, too, has a specific California focus: the mobilization during 1964 to 1972 of a major interdisciplina​ry environmental study that provided scientific, legal, and social-​scientific guidance for the idea of a unified coastal zone management system. In each of these latter episodes, California scientists and policymakers led in movements that would have a formative influence on national and global trends in environmental law and policy. How the relationships of science, law, and policy were configured in each of these moments is of interest because they suggest that problematic issues in resource law and management today have significant historical precedents that present cautionary warnings."
