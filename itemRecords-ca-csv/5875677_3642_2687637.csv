10,Abstract:,"Many marine caenogastropod snails (i.e., whelks) deposit their embryos in egg capsules constructed from a highly resilient, multilaminate biomaterial. Here, researchers provide a quantitative mechanical characterizatio​n of the egg capsules produced by ""Busycon canaliculatum"" and ""B. carica"" in order to assess the response of this biomaterial to physical stresses and to understand how the protein compares to other structurally important biomaterials such as elastin, collagen, or keratin."
