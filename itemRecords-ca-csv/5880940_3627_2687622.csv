10,Abstract:,"In this paper, researchers compare results of deterministic life-history tables and Leslie matrices with those of deterministic stage-based models using four species of elasmobranches (pelagic stingray, sand tiger shark, pelagic thresher shark, and white shark) for which a reasonable amount of life history information was available. The authors investigate actual and annual effective fertility; seasonal and year-round parturition; the difference between step-like and logistic fertility functions in a life- history table; and the difference between fixed-stage and variable-stage distribution in a stage-based model."
