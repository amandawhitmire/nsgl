12,Abstract:,"High levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and bromide (Br) in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River waterways are of concern because DOC and Br are organic and inorganic precursors, respectively, of carcinogenic and mutagenic disinfection byproducts (DBPs). The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers are the two major rivers supplying water to the San Francisco Bay Delta, but sources and loads of DBP precursors into the Delta are still uncertain. The major objectives of this study were to evaluate both the quantity (DOC and Br fluxes) and the quality (reactivity in forming DBPs) of DBP precursors from the Sacramento and San Joaquin watersheds. Water samples were collected every 2 weeks at up to 35 locations along the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and selected tributaries and analyzed for DOC (4 years), Br (1 year), and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (1 year). Selected water samples were also tested for THM formation potential. Estimated fluxes for the Sacramento River were 39000 +/- 12000 Mg DOC year-1 and 59 Mg of Br year-1 as compared to 9000 +/- 5000 Mg of DOC year-1 and 1302 Mg of Br year-1 for the San Joaquin River. The THM formation potential was higher in the San Joaquin River (441 +/- 49 ug L-1) than the Sacramento River (176 +/- 20 ug L-1) because of higher concentrations of both organic (DOC = 3.62 +/- 0.14 vs 1.92 +/- 0.09 mg L-1) and inorganic DBP (Br = 0.80 +/- 0.07 vs <0.03 +/- 0.01 mg L-1) precursors. The Sacramento River's greater DOC load despite lower DOC concentrations is due to its discharge being about 5 times greater than the San Joaquin River (50 x 10^9 vs 10 x 10^9 L day-1). The DOC concentration was significantly correlated with several land-cover types, including agriculture; however, no relationship was found between DOC quality and land-cover at the watershed scale."
