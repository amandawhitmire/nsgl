10,Abstract:,"For pioneer riparian trees, the successful establishment of juveniles is the major demographic bottleneck limiting population growth and persistence. First-year seedlings growing in arid climate zones face high vapor pressure deficits and highly variable water tables, among other stressors. In this study, we investigated the survival and physiological stress response of riparian tree seedlings subjected to a range of water table decline rates, focusing on the native species that dominate the near-channel ecosystem along Central Valley, CA rivers: Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), Goodding's willow (Salix gooddingii), and narrow-leaved willow (S. exigua). Seedling properties measured include survival, growth, xylem water potential, and water use efficiency using stable carbon isotopes. Seedling survival probability was modeled as a function of root growth and root-to-shoot ratio using logistic regression. Water table decline rates â‰¥6 cm/day resulted in full mortality, whereas survival was >63% at rates 0-1 cm/day, and ranged 12-38% at an intermediate 3 cm/day rate. For all species, survival was positively correlated with root growth rate and negatively correlated with shoot-to-root mass ratio, though there was no evidence for seedlings' active adjustment of those properties in response to increased drought stress. Goodding's willow maintained the highest survival and growth across the treatment gradient and showed the largest increase in seasonal water use efficiency in response to water stress. Instantaneous measures of xylem water potential did not show any trend with treatment or species, suggesting that this metric is a poor predictor of relative performance for young riparian seedlings. The willow species' better drought tolerance relative to cottonwood is consistent with the different abiotic conditions experienced during establishment; river flows are generally stable and high in the early spring, when cottonwoods release seeds, and decline more steeply during the later willow dispersal period. River regulation in California's Central Valley has created artificially stable hydrologic conditions. These conditions have impaired recruitment of native riparian tree species whose dispersal presumably depends on pre-regulation cycles of spring flooding and summer drought. Our goal is to develop a predictive understanding of recruitment and survival of the tree species that dominate the initial phase of riparian community development: Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii ), black willow (Salix gooddingii) and sandbar willow (S. exigua). We examined the hypothesis that the timing of seed release with the annual spring snowmelt runoff is critical for successful reproduction of the drought-intolerant seedlings in California's Mediterranean climate. We quantified seed release timing and intensity in six populations along the Tuolumne and San Joaquin rivers for two years and then measured the correspondence between dispersal phenology, river hydrology and local climate. Initiation of the primary seed release period (defined as the dates between which 10 and 90 percent of all open catkins were observed) was earliest for cottonwood (ranging from 7 April to 31 May among sites), followed by black willow (17 May to 8 June) and sandbar willow (30 April to 24 June). Peak seed release for cottonwood coincided with the historical maximum average daily streamflow for each river (24-28 May); willow peak seed release occurred later in the summer at lower river flows. For each species, patterns of seed release varied more among sites than between river basins. Variation in seed production and release timing varied considerably among trees within a site, but very little for each tree in consecutive years. A degree day model was developed to predict seed release initiation from cumulative air temperature and relative humidity thresholds. Patterns of seed release timing are consistent with differences in species' vertical distribution in riparian zones and support the use of flow-based restoration strategies to maintain riparian tree populations in California's Central Valley."
