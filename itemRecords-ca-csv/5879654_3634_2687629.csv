12,Abstract:,Nemerteans experience varying environmental temperatures during low tide exposures. Inducible heat shock proteins (hsps) have been reported for most organisms following both artificial heat stress and natural environmental temperature variations. This preliminary study reports the presence and type of hsps in the phylum Nemertea.
