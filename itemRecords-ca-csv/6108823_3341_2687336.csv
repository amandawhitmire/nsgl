11,Abstract:,"The AP7 and AP24 proteins represent a class of mineral-​interaction polypeptides that are found in the aragonite-​containing nacre layer of mollusk shell (H. rufescens). These proteins have been shown to preferentially interfere with calcium carbonate mineral growth in vitro. It is believed that both proteins play an important role in aragonite polymorph selection in the mollusk shell. Previously, we demonstrated the 1?30 amino acid (AA) N-terminal sequences of AP7 and AP24 represent mineral interaction/mod​ification domains in both proteins, as evidenced by their ability to frustrate calcium carbonate crystal growth at step edge regions. In this present report, using free N-terminal, C!-amide ""capped"" synthetic polypeptides representing the 1?30 AA regions of AP7 (AP7-1 polypeptide) and AP24 (AP24-1 polypeptide) and NMR spectroscopy, we confirm that both N-terminal sequences possess putative Ca (II) interaction polyanionic sequence regions (2 ! ?DD? in AP7-1, ?DDDED? in AP24-1) that are random coil-like in structure. However, with regard to the remaining sequences regions, each polypeptide features unique structural differences. AP7-1 possesses an extended ""-strand or polyproline type II-like structure within the A11?M10, S12?V13, and S28?I27 sequence regions, with the remaining sequence regions adopting a randomcoil- like structure, a trait common to other polyelectrolyte mineral-​associated polypeptide sequences. Conversely, AP24-1 possesses random coil-like structure within A1?S9 and Q14?N16 sequence regions, and evidence for turn-like, bend, or loop conformation within the G10?N13, Q17?N24, and M29?F30 sequence regions, similar to the structures identified within the putative elastomeric proteins Lustrin A and sea urchin spicule matrix proteins. The similarities and differences in AP7 and AP24 N-terminal domain structure are discussed with regard to joint AP7?AP24 protein modification of calcium carbonate growth."
