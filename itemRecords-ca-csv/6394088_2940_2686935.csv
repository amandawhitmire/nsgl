8,Abstract:,"In 2001, the EPA began restricting the use of organophosphate pesticides in bug sprays and strips to protect the health of humans and other mammals. Their main replacement has been another class of highly toxic pesticides known as pyrethroids. The pyrethroid molecule is basically a chemically stabilized version of the natural pyrethrin molecule found in mums (yes, the flowers). In its modified form, it is more persistent in the environment, more hydrophobic (it will stick to sediment) and more toxic."
