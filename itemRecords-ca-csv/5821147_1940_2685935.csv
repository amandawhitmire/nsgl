9,Abstract:,"The world has a 20th-century legacy of overutilization of some ocean resources, and of efforts to get human uses of the ocean under control. The world community already has staged a 1930 League of Nations codification conference on the oceans, and three United Nations Conferences to try to bring some order to our ocean world. Negotiators have also inked over 100 other multilateral, regional, and bilateral treaties to supplement (or confound) the general trends in international ocean law. We cannot escape the past, but must correct our errors and build on our strengths. The situation is one of reasonable progress, but with many challenges ahead. The Convention on the Law of the Sea, despite its length and complexity, has barely touched the surface of potentially needed rules and practices. So opens the introduction to this special issue devoted to ocean governance."
