9,Abstract:,"Several theoretical, analytical, and institutional difficulties have impeded the application of cumulative environmental impact assessment techniques. However, watershed development on coastal wetlands offers an ideal context for evaluating the land disturbance target approach to such studies. A model land use planning system, involving a time series approach, was developed for Elkhorn Slough in California. The approach included four major components: evaluation of erosion susceptibility, measurement of land disturbance, establishment of a land disturbance target, and a comparison of existing and target land disturbance values. Further research is needed to test the transferability of the approach to a wide range of coastal watersheds and to verify the applicability of the methods to other cumulative impact problems."
