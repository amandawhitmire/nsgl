19,Abstract:,"This report was written by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program for west coast fishery and ocean resource managers. It is intended to spark a dialogue about how CalCOFI’s rich ocean monitoring legacy can best contribute to fisheries and marine ecosystem management priorities. In the last decade, new questions are being asked of ocean monitoring and data as our ocean undergoes rapid, unprecedented, and profound changes. Given these emerging and expanded questions, CalCOFI partnered with California Sea Grant to explore today’s ocean monitoring priorities and take a fresh look at how ocean users are leveraging CalCOFI data and products. This report summarizes feedback from these stakeholders and identifies ways in which CalCOFI plans to mature its monitoring program, products, and partnerships to meet ongoing and future fishery and ocean ecosystem monitoring needs."
