10,Abstract:,"Beginning in the first half of the twentieth century, local governments regularly attached conditions, or ""exactions,"" to discretionary land use permits in an effort to address the impacts to which proposed development contributes. However, according to many scholars, Fifth Amendment Takings Clause jurisprudence of the past two decades exerts a ""chilling effect"" on this practice.1 The U.S. Supreme Court's leading decisions in the field, Nollan v. California Coastal Commission2 and Dolan v. City of Tigard,3 explain their objective somewhat narrowly: preventing extortion through the imposition of exactions.4 Yet together, these cases require the permitting entity-as the defendant-to prove that at least those ad hoc exactions eliminating a landowner's right to exclude bear an ""essential nexus"" to and are in ""rough proportionality​"" with the development's impacts to avoid takings liability. Two decades after these holdings, the scope, breadth, and effect of Nollan and Dolan's rather unconventional shifting of the burden of proof remain indeterminate. Given this uncertainty, state courts understandably have attempted-​though in markedly different and at times perplexing ways-to fill in the gaps."
