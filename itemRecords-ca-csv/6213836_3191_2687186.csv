12,Abstract:,"""Current Times: treasures of our local ocean"" is a newspaper supplement about the importance of the local ocean waters to our community. Written by kids for kids, the Big Blue Reporters (the youth editorial board) explored and uncovered many treasures provided by the waters of the Santa Barbara Channel region. Now, through this newspaper, students and children can learn how people rely on and enjoy the local ocean. Be it fisheries (commercial and recreational), offshore oil, ocean farming or marine recreation (surfing, boating, diving whale watching), or the beauty or cultural importance, the local ocean provides much for our community. The authors hope by increasing the understanding of its value (both economic and cultural) teachers, parents, students, and children will explore, enjoy and take care of this environment."
