12,Abstract:,"Sooty Shearwaters (Puffinus griseus) are the most abundant avian predator in the California Current System (CCS); however, their movements during the upwelling season have not been well-studied. They often forage in huge flocks (>100,000) consuming massive amounts of forage fish, and potentially impacting forage fish availability for other predators. Here, we examined the at-sea movements of satellitetrackeâ€‹d non-breeding Sooty Shearwaters (SOSH) in the CCS during the upwelling season of 2008, and their responses to spatial and temporal variability in winds."
