15,Abstract:,"This report incorporates information from scientific literature, legal reviews, our research on nontoxic antifouling strategies, and comments by clientele and colleagues of our Extension program. It is intended to provide information that may assist representatives of boat owners; boating and coating businesses; port, harbor, marina and yacht club managers; government agencies and policy makers; academic institutions; and environmental organizations. They will need to make decisions on policies, practices, technologies, research, and education to prevent boat-hull transport of invasive species, while reducing pollution from antifouling paints."
