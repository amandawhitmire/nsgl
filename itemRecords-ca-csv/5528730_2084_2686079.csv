10,Abstract:,"Infestations of decapod crustaceans by symbiotic nemertean egg predators are common; for some host species nemertean intensities can be high enough to cause a substantial reduction in egg survival. Sampling has been conducted from a range of tanner crab populations in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea to determine the extent of infestation by nemerteans. In general the geographic pattern of abundance of nemerteans on ""Chionoecetes bairdi"" paralleled the geographic distribution of these worms on the red king crab, ""Paralithodes camtschatica,"" ranging from high levels in certain Cook Inlet and Kodiak Island populations to a virtual absence in the Bering Sea."
