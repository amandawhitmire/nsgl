8,Abstract:,The research presented here is a statistical study of temperature variability in the coastal region near the Los Angeles County Sanitation District sewage outfalls off Whites Point on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The study uses temperature data from the USC mooring along with other available hydrographic measurements to characterize seasonal temperature stratification using monthly means. The purpose of this study is to examine the behavior of the temperature field at the shelf break off the Palos Verdes Peninsula with a view to implications regarding the distribution of the waste water effluent field.
