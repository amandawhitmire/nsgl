9,Abstract:,"The investigator of this California Sea Grant project, Susan Williams of Bodega Marine Laboratory, wrote the scientific justification for Assembly Bill 1334, which banned the sale, possession and importation of nine species of Caulerpa seaweeds in California. Williams also testified before the House Finance Committee on this bill and worked with Assemblymember Tom Harman, the bill's sponsor, to explain the scientific rationale for the ban to lobbyists for the aquarium trade. This project was part of a broader regional effort led by NOAA Fisheries and California Department of Fish and Game that in 2006 eradicated Caulerpa taxifolia from California. Its eradication was a major victory, as it was the first time any group had eradicated an established population of what the European media has dubbed ""the killer algae."" Had the seaweed spread to the open ocean, it might have caused some of the same dire consequences as in the Mediterranean Sea and Australia, where it has converted once biologically diverse seafloor habitats into Caulerpa monocultures."
