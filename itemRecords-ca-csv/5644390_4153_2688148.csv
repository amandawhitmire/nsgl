13,Abstract:,"Substantial and unexplained variations in abundance characterize US west coast populations of Dungeness crab, ""Cancer magister"". It is likely that this variability reflects oceanic advection of larvae given the dynamics of the California Current system, the protracted (4-5 months) pelagic larval phase and the restrictive nature of juvenile habitat requirements. Using stratified Washington commercial landings data for the period 1951-1990 as an index of year class strength, a new conceptual model of recruitment for the species is proposed based on alongshore larval transport and restrictive habitat requirements for juveniles. The model, comprising explicit assumptions and testable components, is offered as al alternative to the prevailing recruitment hypothesis and an heuristic framework for further research."
