10,Abstract:,"A series of three Holocene peat horizons, one of which is a closely spaced couplet, are found at several locations along the margins of Humboldt Bay, northwestern California. The modern and stratigraphic distributions of salt marsh foraminiferids are being studied to determine changes in relative sea level caused by tectonic events on the Cascadia subduction zone. Studies indicate that small scale changes in paleo-sea level could be determined by identifying modern associations, determining the zone in the marsh that association represents, and showing the changes in the marsh zones over time. The upper surface of the first buried peat at Mad River slough shows a foraminiferid association indicative of a position near the higher high water boundary. Three centimeters above this horizon, within a massive bed of intertidal muds, an association was discovered that lived between the mean tidal level and mean high water. Considering the elevation of these tidal datums at Mad River slough, this change in foraminiferid association corresponds to a potential magnitude of subsidence of between 0.4 and 1.3 m within the span of time necessary to deposit 3 cm of sediment."
