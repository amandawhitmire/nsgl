15,Abstract:,"California Sea Grant (CASG) uses a management team approach in setting policies and coordinating the programâ€™s activities in research, outreach and education in one of the most populous and diverse coastal states in the nation. The team meets bimonthly face-to-face, and uses telephone and email discussions to deal with urgent business that arises between meetings. This document reports on the activities and accomplishments of the California Sea Grant College Program for 2007-2010. It was compiled as a booklet for the Sea Grant Site Review Team."
