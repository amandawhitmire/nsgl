11,Abstract:,"Today, in the quest of safely extending bottom diving time, industry has developed the in-situ dive computer, allowing constant computation of the decompression status. Neither tables nor dive computers can eliminate all decompression problems. The workshop covered here was attended by technical representatives of dive computer manufacturers, authors of decompression algorithms, diving physiologists, and knowledgeable users. After intense information exchange, discussions, and evaluations of each of the dive computers, it was concluded that they are presently in the second generation of development. After evaluating the available database on pressure-​related injuries to examine the effectiveness of dive computers, it was the consensus that such devices have demonstrable potential for use in the entire diving community; guidelines for their use within the scientific diving community were formulated. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. The history of underwater decompression devices and computers. Karl E. Huggins pp. 7-30. 2. ORCA industries' dive computers. Paul A. Heinmiller pp. 35-42. 3. The Datamaster II: a fundamentally different computer. John E. Lewis pp. 43-48. 4. The Suunto SME-ML presents the concept of multi-level diving.
