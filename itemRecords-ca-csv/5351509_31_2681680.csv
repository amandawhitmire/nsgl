13,Abstract:,"One of the features that distinguishes Sea Grant from other large federal research programs is the delegation of significant funding and review responsibilitieâ€‹s to an on-site program director and staff. This means that the many individual projects in research, education and advisory services are coordinated with one another to make maximum use of the available resources to meet the marine-related needs and problems of the Los Angeles area. University of Southern California (USC) Sea Grant management integrates the resources and concerns of community groups, university researchers, funding agencies and other Sea Grant programs. FY 83-84 was the 14th year of the University of Southern California's participation in the National Sea Grant College Program. At USC, Sea Grant researchers can draw on substantial facilities and a long tradition of excellence in marine research. The Sea Grant program is one of several programs within the university's Institute for Marine and Coastal Studies, founded in 1975."
