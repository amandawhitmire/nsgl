12,Abstract:,"A crowned sea urchin, (Centrostephanu​s coronatus) was seen and documented on 12 April 2016 on rocky reef substrate in the kelp forest near the Monterey breakwater in Monterey Bay, California (36o 36.63’ N, 121o 53.66’ W) by the first author during a scuba dive. This observation represents a northward range extension of about 330 kilometers from the previously reported northernmost occurrence of this species at the northern Channel Islands, California (Engle and Richards 2001; Pearse 1972). This subtropical species has a reported distribution from the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador) in the south to the northern Channel Islands (California, USA) in the north (Gotshall 2005). The specimen was photographed and its test diameter was estimated to be about 4 centimeters (Figure 1). Its identification as Centrostephanus coronatus was confirmed by the co-authors based on photographs. There is no other known, almost black species of sea urchin in California waters with the characteristic blue around the base of the spines (R. Mooi, California Academy of Sciences, personal communication). In southern California, this species is present in much lower densities than other common sea urchin species. Nevertheless, C. coronatus has increased in abundance over the last seven years in the southern Californian region. Reef Check California, a program that uses citizen scientists to survey California’s rocky reefs using standardized 60 m2 belt transects, has surveyed the densities of this species since 2006 (Freiwald et al. 2015; Gillett et al. 2012). These surveys document the spatial and temporal variation of crowned urchin recruitment and increases in population densities in southern California and show how, especially in 2015, its abundance has increased in the northern Channel Islands."
