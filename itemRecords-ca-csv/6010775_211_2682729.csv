11,Abstract:,"In the early 1970's on the western coast of the United States, a lucrative fishery was developed for the red sea urchin, ""Strongylocentr​otus franciscanus"" (Kato 1972). In the absence of fishing regulations, the size of individuals and the total catch of red sea urchins declined in the early 1980's (Kato and Schroeter 1985). Based on the analysis of data on gonad size, regulations were introduced in 1989 to limit the seasonal harvest of urchins and to establish a minimum harvestable size for sea urchins. These regulations have had limited success maintaining resource stability. As a result, the California fishery supports far fewer urchin harvesters today. In the last 15 years, especially since 1987, a fishery for the green sea urchin, ""Strongylocentr​otus droebachiensis,​"" has become the seventh largest in the Northeastern United States, and is the third largest in Maine behind lobsters and aquacultured Atlantic salmon (NOAA NR96-11, September, 17, 1996). Early unregulated harvesting and continued overfishing have drastically depleted once abundant field populations in the Gulf of Maine. In Maine during 1993, 41 million pounds of urchins were harvested and 26 million dollars were earned by the urchin industry. Since this peak harvest, urchin landings have quickly declined while the price per pound has increased. Recently, urchin fishermen, processors, and state government agencies in New Hampshire, Maine, and Massachusetts have recognized that a significant decline has occurred in urchin populations and have attempted to coordinate their efforts to realize a sustainable urchin harvest. Substantial data are available on seasonal changes in gonad size of Gulf of Maine green sea urchins and other populations around the world (Miller and Bishop 1973, Fletcher et al. 1974, Mottet 1976, Himmelman 1978, Keats et al. 1983, Vadas et al. 1989, Munk 1992). Despite these studies, which clearly show when harvesting would yield the maximum product and dollar value, regulation has been slow to match the rate of growth of the fishery. A more complete understanding of the reproductive biology of urchins is needed to harvest natural populations on a sustainable basis or to initiate urchin aquaculture. The purpose of this special section on sea urchin aquaculture was to gather a group of biologists, aquaculturists, and economists with a common interest in the aquaculture or the sustainable harvest of natural populations of sea urchins."
