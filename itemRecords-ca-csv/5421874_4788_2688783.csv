9,Abstract:,"The most common sanitizers used in food plants belong to four basic groups: chlorine compounds, iodine compounds, quaternary ammonium compounds, and acid-anionic surfactants. The selection of a sanitizer should be based on the type of equipment to be sanitized, the hardness of the water, the sanitizing equipment available, the effectiveness of the sanitizer under site conditions, and cost. Sanitizing compounds which contain phenols impart strong undesirable odors and flavors to foods and should not be used. This publication describes the characteristics and effectiveness of some common sanitizers."
