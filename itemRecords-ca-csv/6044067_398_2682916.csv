10,Abstract:,"The California Coastal Platform Information Management System is a Microsoft Excel 4.0 for Windows based, IBM PC compatible, software implementation of the first level of a screening system for the reassessment and requalification of offshore platforms, such as proposed by Bea and Craig [1993] and Aggarwal [1991]. By ""first level,"" it is meant that this program provides the basic structure for a complete Requalification Management System (RMS), including methods for the management of platform information and for the performance of Level One Structural Reliability and Consequence Assessments. More complex analyses are not included. Thus the California Coastal Platform Information Management System is more advanced than an Information Management System (IMS), but less advanced than a complete Requalification Management System (RMS). For brevity's sake, the system will be referred to in this document as ""the IMS."" Development of the IMS was funded by the California Sea Grant College, the California State Lands Commission, Norsk Hydro Inc., and the U. S. Minerals Management Service. The system is intended as an advance in implementation but not in theory: existing methodologies are employed (especially Bea and Craig's Level One Structural Reliability Assessment techniques and Aggarwal's Level One Consequence Assessment techniques), and implemented in an easy-to-use software package. The system's features can be divided into three main functions: basic platform information management operations, screening cycle operations, and graphical platform information management operations. The first item, basic platform information management operations, is described in Chapter 3 and involves the management of a database that includes such physical descriptors as platform name, location, water depth, production, etc. An unlimited number of platforms may be so described. Screening cycle operations are discussed in Chapter 4 and include structural reliability, consequence, and risk assessment procedures; multiple methods of performing the latter two are provided. Although only ""Level One"" screening cycle procedures are incorporated, the system is designed to be the basis for more detailed screening cycle analysis techniques as they are developed. The third item, graphical platform information management operations, is described in Chapter 5; it is primarily implemented as a means of inputting probabilistic platform environmental data through direct graphical manipulation. The operations described in Chapters 4 and 5 allow the selection of only one platform per program session. Chapters 1 and 2 cover program installation and user familiarizationâ€‹. Appendix A describes system customization; Appendix B provides a table of California platform data; and Appendix C discusses advanced system set-up procedures."
