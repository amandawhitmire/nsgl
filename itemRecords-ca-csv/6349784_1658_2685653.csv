10,Abstract:,"The following local flora of the tidal wetlands and their ecotones at Rush Ranch (Solano Land Trust) in Suisun Marsh, Solano County, California is compiled and adapted from multiple sources, primarily the unpublished plant lists, long-term transect monitoring data, and field notes of Brenda Grewell (1990-2011), unpublished field notes of Peter Baye (1992-present), as well as published technical reports (Mason 1972; Ruygt 1994; Grewell and others 2003; Fiedler and others 2004; Grewell 2005), and journal articles (Fielder and others 2007; Grewell 2008). The geographic scope of the surveys was limited to estuarine wetlands and their terrestrial ecotones influenced by either periodic or episodic flooding by tidal waters, including extreme storm flooding events with wave run-up above still-water elevations, indicated by remnant tidal debris."
