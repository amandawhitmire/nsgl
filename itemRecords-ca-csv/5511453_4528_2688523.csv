8,Abstract:,"Silicon nitride (Si3N4) is a main candidate for many high performance applications because of the good combination of mechanical, thermal and thermomechanica​l properties. Requirements for more complex and economic machining processing to produce net shapes of such high hardness materials demand new approaches to the machining of Si3N4. The goal of this investigation was to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the strength loss (30-40%) in Si3N4 machined with a C02 laser and to discover ways of recovering this loss. A new and potentially cost-effective approach is demonstrated for producing shaped articles of Si3N4 involving laser machining and etching. It may be possible to extend this approach to SiC and composites of the silicon compound ceramics."
