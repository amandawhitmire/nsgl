10,Abstract:,"Coastal marine environments are subject to considerable input of anthropogenic materials from terrestrial, municipal, commercial, industrial, and residential sources. Interest in assessing the biodegradation potential of numerous xenobiotic compounds by indigenous microbial populations in these environments has motivated research efforts. This paper describes the use of a tritiated phenol, [2,6-​3H]""p""-​cresol in a method for measuring pollutant biodegradation by microbial populations in marine waters."
