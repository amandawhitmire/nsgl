10,Abstract:,"Despite the reports of changes in intestinal function when freshwater salmonids are transferred to seawater, there has been no comprehensive description of salmonid gastrointestinaâ€‹l tract adaptation during the first few days in salt water, nor have there been comparisons of such adaptation between pre-smolts (parr), smolts, and post-smolts. Because intestinal water absorption is so crucial to successful seawater adaptation, the investigations described here were designed to help answer these questions. The objectives were to describe changes that occur in intestinal water absorption and related processes when coho salmon adapt to seawater, especially during the first 7 days of seawater residence, and to test the hypothesis that these changes proceed more effectively in smolts, compared to pre- and post- smolts."
