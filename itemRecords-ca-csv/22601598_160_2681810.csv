15,Abstract:,"On April 5, 2019, a workshop entitled “Improving Oil Spill Preparedness and Response in Santa Barbara” was held at the Santa Barbara Zoo Discovery Pavilion. The workshop was attended by sixty-seven participants representing a variety of stakeholders and emergency responders including county representatives and agencies, state and federal agencies, non-​governmental organizations, academic researchers, indigenous community representatives​, legislative representatives from Santa Barbara county and congressional offices, consultants, and private industry. The workshop goals were to: 1. Share lessons learned from the 2015 Refugio oil spill 2. Consider impacts of oil spills on public health and socioeconomic sectors 3. Examine opportunities for community involvement in oil spill response 4. Review best practices 5. Improve future preparation The workshop was structured in two parts to achieve these goals: a morning session was designed to review challenges and lessons learned in the 2015 Refugio oil spill, followed by an afternoon session focused on future improvements in oil spills, with panel discussions and breakout sessions on public communication, oil spill response, monitoring of human health and social dimensions, and a closing panel on oil spill prevention. The morning session opened with a keynote and land acknowledgment address by Das Williams, First District Supervisor of the County of Santa Barbara, a former member of the California State Assembly and former Santa Barbara City Councilman. Williams emphasized the importance of updating aging infrastructure and adopting the latest technologies to reduce the scale of spills. His talk was followed by speakers who were heavily engaged in 2015 Refugio oil spill response operations from U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), CA Department of Fish and Wildlife, Office of Spill Prevention and Response (CDFWOSPR), United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Santa Barbara County Fire, as well as local non-​governmental organizations that reviewed lessons learned from the spill, including Environmental Defense Center (EDC), and the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation. The afternoon session began with a panel discussion on public communication of risks and volunteer opportunities, with speakers from USCG, CDFW-OSPR, and EDC. The second panel addressed oil spill response with regard to improvements in response operations such as technology, timeliness, personnel, monitoring, sampling, and oil fingerprinting analysis, and these topics were addressed by speakers from USCG, NOAA, Santa Barbara Channel Keeper, and CDFW-OSPR. The third panel addressed monitoring of human health, natural resources, social and economic dimensions, with speakers from the Santa Barbara Air Pollution Control District, UC Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute, CDFW-OSPR, the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, and the Wishtoyo Chumash Foundation. Following these panels were breakout sessions on the same topics. The last panel of the day concerned oil spill prevention, with speakers from CA State Lands Commission, USCG, Accufacts Inc., and Santa Barbara County."
