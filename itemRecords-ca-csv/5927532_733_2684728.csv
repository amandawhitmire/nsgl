20,Abstract:,"Anthropogenic factors that contribute to sea level rise (SLR) hazards (storm surges, erosion, shoreline recession, etc.) include increases in population, technology and production/consâ€‹umption. Coastal urbanization is the overriding local determinant of SLR impacts in California and Maine, exacerbated by demands for coastal development and increasing conflicts between coastal stakeholders over resource use. Local policy instruments are needed which are based on scientific criteria and which incorporate SLR considerations into local planning. Here researchers assess the potential effectiveness of policy instruments in preserving beaches in Ventura County, California, and south coastal Maine, but not the effectiveness of the policies themselves."
