16,Abstract:,"This update assessment reports the status of the petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) resource off the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington using data through 2014. While petrale sole are modeled as a single stock, the spatial aspects of the coast-wide population are addressed through geographic separation of data sources/fleets where possible. There is currently no genetic evidence suggesting distinct biological stocks of petrale sole off the U.S. coast. The limited tagging data available to describe adult movement suggests that petrale sole may have some homing ability for deep water spawning sites but also have the ability to move long distances between spawning sites, inter-spawning season, as well as seasonally."
