15,Abstract:,"As a result of the October 17, 1989, Loma Prieta (Santa Cruz Mountains, California) earthquake, liquefaction of the fluvial, estuarine, eolian, and beach sediments under a sand spit destroyed the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories and damaged other structures and utilities. Intitial studies suggested that the liquefaction was a local phenomenon. More detailed offshore investigations, however, indicate that it occurred over a large area (max. 8 km2) during or shortly after the earthquake with movement of unconsolidated sediment toward and into the head of Monterey submarine canyon. This paper reports the extent of the liquefaction that occurred both onshore and offshore at Moss Landing from the Loma Prieta earthquake, describes the ground failures, and speculates on the consequences of similar occurrences in the future."
