9,Abstract:,"Expansion is the word that best characterizes the USC Sea Grant Program's fifth year of existence. However, it wasn't just an internal expansion within the University structure, but a community-â€‹wide one as well. Sea Grant, by the very nature of its Congressional mandate, represents science and technology in action . . . with a purpose. Action for its own sake, without an ideological framework, and perpetuated in a vacuum, is not a Good in and of itself. This is why the University of Southern California's Sea Grant Program, in directing the thrust of its 1974-75 fiscal year activity to the identified coastal zone management needs of southern California. This annual report for the University of Southern California Sea Grant is for the period of 1974-1975."
