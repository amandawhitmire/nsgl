8,Abstract:,"Atmospheric testing of thermonuclear devices during the 1950s and 1960s created a global radiocarbon (14C) signal in the ocean environment. The bomb-generated radiocarbon signal retained in fish otoliths can be used as a permanent, time- specific marker of the radiocarbon present in ambient seawater, making it a useful tool in age validation of fishes. The goal of this study was to determine radiocarbon levels in otoliths of the age-validated yelloweye rockfish (""Sebastes ruberrimus"") to establish a chronometer for radiocarbon in the waters of southeast Alaska and to validate age of the quillback rockfish (""Sebastes maliger"") using this chronometer. Radiocarbon values from the first year's growth of 43 yelloweye rockfish otoliths were plotted against estimated birth year to produce a radiocarbon time series for southeast Alaskan waters from 1940 to 1990. Radiocarbon measured in quillback rockfish otoliths, with estimated birth years from 1950 to 1985, was similar to values recorded for the yelloweye rockfish during the same period. The agreement between the rockfish records successfully validated the age estimates for the quillback rockfish and the ageing methodology of otoliths for this species. The establishment of a radiocarbon chronometer in the waters of southeast Alaska, and the successful age validation of the quillback rockfish based on this chronometer provides a valuable tool useful for future age validation of marine fishes in this region."
