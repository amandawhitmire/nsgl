13,Abstract:,"The fluorescence spectra of the compound PDMPO are affected by the presence of polymeric silicic acid. The unique PDMPO-silica fluorescence is explored here to visualize Si deposition in living diatoms. Experiments show that PDMPO quickly enters diatom cells and is specifically incorporated into the newly synthesized frustules, and can therefore be used as an ideal fluorescent tracer for Si. The authors present the characterizatio​n of the fluorescent properties of PDMPO in relation with Si, and the first results obtained as a biosilicificati​on tracer in living cells."
