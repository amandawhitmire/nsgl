9,Abstract:,"This paper addresses the topic of the transient hydrodynamic force exerted on a water-piercing section and can be related to the problem of sideways collision (which generates the highest impact energy) or the berthing of ships. It is assumed that strip-theory is a valid assumption for this case, and only the planar problem is dealt with. A numerical method is implemented to follow in the time domain the sideways motion of a circular cylindrical section. The motion of a cylinder towed with a constant force is computed and results are compared with those obtained from traditional linear computations. The case of a body moving with a constant velocity and submitted to a restoring spring force is then described. With the technique described, various initial conditions are shown to affect the results of interest to the designer."
