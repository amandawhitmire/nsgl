13,Abstract:,"Natural variation and changing climate in coastal oceans subject meroplanktonic organisms to broad ranges of pHand oxygen ([O2]) levels. In controlled-​laboratory experiments we explored the interactive effects of pH, [O2], andsemidiurnal pH fluctuations on the survivorship, development, and size of early life stages of two mytilid mussels,Mytilus californianus and M. galloprovincial​is. Survivorship of larvae was unaffected by low pH, low [O2], or semidiurnalfluc​tuations for both mytilid species. Low pH (<7.6) resulted in delayed transition from the trochophore to veligerstage, but this effect of low pH was absent when incorporating semidiurnal fluctuations in both species. Also at lowpH, larval shells were smaller and had greater variance; this effect was absent when semidiurnal fluctuations of0.3 units were incorporated at low pH for M. galloprovincial​is but not for M. californianus. Low [O2] in combinationwith low pH had no effect on larval development and size, indicating that early life stages of mytilid mussels are largelytolerant to a broad range of [O2] reflective of their environment (80–260 lmol kg1). The role of pH variabilityshou​ld be recognized as an important feature in coastal oceans that has the capacity to modulate the effects of oceanacidificat​ion on biological responses."
