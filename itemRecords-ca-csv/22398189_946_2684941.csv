17,Abstract:,"A large-scale monitoring program associated with the establishment of a marine protected area network in southern California provided an opportunity to observe and document unique or rare species across the region. Scientists and students from several educational and research institutions surveyed 145 subtidal reefs, 39 intertidal reefs, and five sandy beaches from 2011–2017, a period of time where oceanographic and climatic conditions changed serially and dramatically. In conjunction with an increase in monitoring frequency and locations, dramatic shifts in oceanographic climate during this same time period likely caused shifts in tolerable habitat conditions for many nearshore species. Here we describe range extensions, both to the north and south, of 14 marine fish, invertebrate, and algae species as observed during the 2011–2012 South Coast MPA Baseline Program and subsequent monitoring efforts."
