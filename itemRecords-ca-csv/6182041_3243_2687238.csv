9,Abstract:,"After more than a decade of studying rockfish reproduction, growth and development, biologists in 2006 successfully reared brown rockfish (Sebastes auriculatus) from birth through their critical life stages. The achievement is significant because rockfish, more than other fish, have fragile and complicated early life histories. They are also prone to overfishing and hence have been a priority for fisheries management. The ability to raise the fish in captivity, scientists say, adds significantly to what is known about this commercial species' early growth and development. It also opens the door to the possibility of rearing rockfish for stock enhancement. Eventually, it may even be possible to farm native California rockfish for human consumption, as is currently done with native Asian species (which are easier to grow) in Japan and Korea."
