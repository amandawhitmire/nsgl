10,Abstract:,"What kinds of ecosystems are most successful, where is life the most rich and diverse, and what factors tend to undermine that prosperity-​-​these are some of the questions addressed in this sixth unit of the ""Wet and Wild"" K-6 marine education teacher guides. Models of smaller ecosystems and analogies for the human situation are explored with discussions of food webs, energy budgets, nutrient cycles, and the interdependence and mutualistic relationship of all living things. Presentations are in English and Spanish."
