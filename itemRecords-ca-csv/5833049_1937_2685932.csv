10,Abstract:,"Based on genetic analyses of a population sample taken in 1992, it has been suggested that a 1979 outplanting of red abalone ""Haliotis rufescens,"" on the south side of San Miguel Island (California), was successful and probably sustained the fishery there through the 1980s. The authors of this paper resampled the San Miguel population in 1999 and found no genetic signature of the outplants. The results suggest that either the composition of the San Miguel abalone population changed rapidly between 1992 and 1999, or the genetic anomalies attributed to hatchery source for the 1992 sample were due to sample degradation or other laboratory artifacts."
