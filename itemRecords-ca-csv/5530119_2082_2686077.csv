10,Abstract:,"Nemerteans of the genus ""Carcinonemerte​s"" are specialized symbionts of decapod crustaceans; several species eat the eggs of their hosts and this trophic habit may be diagnostic for the genus. Here the egg predator ""Carcinonemerte​s wickhami"" n.sp., from the broods of the spiny lobster ""Panulirus interruptus,"" is described. Its distinctive morphological characters are discussed, and aspects of its life history are compared with those of other members of the genus."
