10,Abstract:,"The description of ""Apogon dianthus,"" previously known from a single specimen from Palau, is expanded based on new material from Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Comoros. Specimens from Palau and the Comoros differ from those in other areas by having fewer gill rakers, a deeper caudal peduncle, and a shorter spine in the second dorsal fin."
