11,Abstract:,"Interest in the biological role of vanadium has surged recently with the discovery of the first two naturally occurring vanadium enzymes, vanadium bromoperoxidase and vanadium nitrogenase, and the recognition that vanadium is involved in other important biological processes. Vanadium bromoperoxidase has been isolated primarily from marine macroalgae. Numerous halogenated natural products have been isolated from marine organisms. Haloperoxidases are thought to be involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds. In this study, the authors investigate the mechanism of inhibition by substrate hydrogen peroxide, the stoichiometry of the bromination and dioxygen formation reactions, the electrophilic versus radical nature of the bromination reaction, the competition between the bromide-​assisted disproportionat​ion of hydrogen peroxide and MCD bromination, and the origin of each oxygen atom in the dioxygen that is produced."
