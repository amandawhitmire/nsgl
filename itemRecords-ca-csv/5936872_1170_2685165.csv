12,Abstract:,"The authors' purpose in this study was to determine baseline abundances for abalone populations in California. Using fishery landings from a peak decade for each of the species (white, pink, black, green, and threaded) with sufficient data, they estimated baseline abundances. For species with limited data, such as flat and pinto abalone, they analyzed fishery-â€‹independent density data from the past. Estimates are compared to more recent data."
