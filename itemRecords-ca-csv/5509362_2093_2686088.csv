12,Abstract:,"Improvement of fuel efficiency on trawlers can be achieved by decreasing the resistance of the towed fishing gear. For towed trawl gear, resistance is nearly equally distributed between the doors and the net itself. A previous experiment examined fuel savings resulting from use of a hydrodynamicall​y designed trawl door compared to a standard V-door. To investigate possible fuel savings resulting from changes in net design, the present study was initiated. A standard shrimp net was modified to decrease resistance, and fuel consumption and efficiency were examined under fishing conditions. Catch efficiency of the new design was also examined."
