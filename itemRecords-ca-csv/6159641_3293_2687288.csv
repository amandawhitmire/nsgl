12,Abstract:,"A seventeen slide Powerpoint presentation presented at the 2005 World Aquaculture Society Meeting in Indonesia. The authors hypothesize that the mechanism of TSV resistance in FG- and SPR-line of shrimp is different. The work in progress: to determine if recombinant LDLr protein indeed binds to TSV. Also, to examine the expression of downstream genes (e.g. ubiquitin, protease) in LDLr pathways in TSV-susceptible and TSV-resistant shrimp. Funding agencies included California Sea Grant and the Advanced Bionutrition Corporation in Columbia, Maryland."
