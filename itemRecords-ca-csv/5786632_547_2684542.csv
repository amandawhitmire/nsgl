9,Abstract:,"Abalone aquaculture in California and Baja California is expanding. Production of 70-132 metric tons between 1992 and 1996 has resulted in sales of over 2 million dollars annually. Production systems have diversified within-water growout facilities. Resource management agencies, the abalone aquaculture industry, and university researchers have addressed the introduced sabellid worm problem. Larval and seed enhancement are the main activities of research and development firms in California and fishery cooperatives in Baja California."
