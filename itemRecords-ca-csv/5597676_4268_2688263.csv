10,Abstract:,"Vanadium (20-35 nM) is the second most abundant transition metal ion in the ocean (after molybdenum). Given the high concentration of vanadium, it is not surprising that the first naturally occurring vanadium-​containing enzyme, a bromoperoxidase​, was found in the marine environment. Vanadium bromoperoxidase has now been isolated from many species of marine algae and a terrestrial lichen. Haloperoxidases are enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of a halide (i.e., chloride, bromide or iodide) by hydrogen peroxide which results in the halogenation of organic substrates, the production of the corresponding hypohalous acid (under certain limiting circumstances) or the production of dioxygen by the subsequent reduction of the oxidized halide species by a second equivalent of hydrogen peroxide. The emphasis of this review article is on the reactivity of vanadium bromoperoxidase (V-BrPO), particularly its catalytic chemistry. A brief summary of the molecular properties of V-BrPO is presented."
