10,Abstract:,"Boat owners must control hull fouling to maintain vessel speed and fuel efficiency. Widely used, copper-based, antifouling paints initially slow fouling on boat hulls due to their toxic nature, although some invasive species can grow on hulls coated with copper antifoulants.6 These toxic paints face restrictions in California and possibly elsewhere due to water quality concerns. 1,3,7a,7b Thus, nontoxic and less-toxic hull coatings will likely become more common. As a result, companion strategies, such as in-water hull cleaning, are also needed to control hull fouling."
