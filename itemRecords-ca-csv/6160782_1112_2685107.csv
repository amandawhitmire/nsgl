14,Abstract:,"Seacliff erosion plagues the coastline of northern San Diego County, California through both marine and subaerial processes. Heavy development on seacliffs and the economic value of beaches in San Diego County, California place a heavy emphasis on maintaining a healthy and safe beach. This paper illustrates the development of a rapid response program to study and document seacliff erosional processes utilizing a terrestrial LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) system in combination with interactive visualization techniques to publically present this research. One of the cliff failures currently being studied as part of this rapid response program is described in this paper to demonstrate the insights that can be gained by observing the temporal change of a failure mass using frequent site monitoring."
