9,Abstract:,"The seasonality of proliferative kidney disease (PKD) in rainbow trout, ""Salmo gairdneri"", at the American River Hatchery, California, was primarily dependent on the presence or absence of the infectious stage in the water supply, rather than on temperature or stocking schedule. Infections were obtained from April through October at ambient temperatures 12-20 deg C. Trout which had recovered from clinical infections were found to be resistant to reinfection. Resistance was induced by active infection and not just previous exposure to the infectious stage. Trout surviving PKD were also found to harbour later sporogonic stages of the parasite for at least one year following initial infection, but fully formed spores, as judges by well-developed valves, were not observed."
