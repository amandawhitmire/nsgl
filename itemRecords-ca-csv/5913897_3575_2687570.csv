9,Abstract:,Recent findings of the underlying molecular mechanisms governing silica biosynthesis have led to the development of new structure-​directing catalysts and environmentally benign routes to the synthesis and structural control of silica and organosilicon-​based materials at neutral pH and low temperature. This chapter reviews recent progress and the limitations that remain in efforts to understand and harness the mechanisms governing biosilicificati​on.
