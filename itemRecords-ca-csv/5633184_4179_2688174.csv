9,Abstract:,"In the late 1940s and 1950s, the pioneers of marine microbiology showed that marine bacteria produce antimicrobial agents. Slightly later, the bactericidal property of seawater was recognized, and it was suspected that this was due to the production of antibiotics by planktonic algae and bacteria. Despite these early observations, relatively little attention has been directed toward the study of natural products from marine bacteria. This chapter provides a brief overview of marine bacteria and a summary of most of the structurally-​unique metabolites that have been discovered through fermentation. Most of the compounds discovered to date come from only a few groups of microorganisms, and as new and unusual marine microorganisms are studied, it is certain that new metabolites will be discovered from this developing resource."
