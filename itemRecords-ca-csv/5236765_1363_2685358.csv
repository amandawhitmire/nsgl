10,Abstract:,"The feasibility of using coastal waters for thermal waste disposal in electrical power generation is determined to a large extent by the restrictions imposed by public institutions. The intent of these restrictions is to preserve environmental quality and to provide a means of evaluating the impact of such activities on the coastal ecosystem. This report attempts to describe the natural variability of the coastal temperature field on the Southern California continental shelf and to identify the processes that are most important in determining its behavior. This description is made in a framework that is suitable for answering a few of the questions associated with thermal waste disposal practices. A simple model is presented that describes certain features of the far dispersion field and suggests that tidal processes are important in determining the nature of the temperature background and the advective current characteristicsâ€‹ appropriate to the far field. Finally, a few suggestions are made regarding future modelling efforts."
