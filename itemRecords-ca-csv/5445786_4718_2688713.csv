7,Abstract:,"Oxygen-18 labeled water, when used in conjunction with either tritiated (HTO) or deuterated (HDO) water, provides an accurate measure of CO2 production and hence the metabolic rate of free living animals. The intent here is to provide the reader with a general understanding of labeled water methodologies with specific application to measurements of energy and material intake in marine mammals. A general discussion of these techniques, the assumptions inherent with their use and a more detailed explanation of their application to quantify energy production, food and milk intake, and fasting metabolic rate are presented."
