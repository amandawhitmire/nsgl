9,Abstract:,"As an institution whose success has been linked to the vision and support of the University of California, California Sea Grant celebrates Scripps Institution of Oceanography's centennial and also a milestone of its own-- that of turning 30 in October 2003. At the helm today is Russell Moll, an ecologist by training. Under his leadership, California Sea Grant continues the tradition of being the largest of the now 30 Sea Grant programs. In the 2003 fiscal year, California Sea Grant channeled approximately $6.6 million in federal and state funds into coastal marine research, public outreach, and education projects in California. These funds supported about 40 research and outreach projects at 19 academic institutions and marine laboratories in the state, as well as 39 scholarships, fellowships, and graduate stipends. Underlying Sea Grant's mission is the strongly held belief that science must be shared with others if it is to have an impact. This is the main charge of our award winning Communications Department. California Sea Grant's 30th is a milestone made possible by NOAA, National Sea Grant, the University of California, and many folks at Scripps."
