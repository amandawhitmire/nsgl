10,Abstract:,"This final report was a project that was under a three year grant from the National Sea Grant Office and through continuing support from National Marine Fisheries Service Contracts. The Pacific albacore fishery is one of the mos valuable of the west coast of North America, yielding an average annual harvest of 22,800 tons of premium quality tuna to California, Oregon, and Washington fishermen. Because of the high value of the albacore harvest, and also because of significant scientific interest in these trans-Pacific migrants, extensive researches have been conducted on albacore over the past several decades by scientists of State and Federal agencies and a number of Pacific Coast universities. Since Pacific Coast fisheries data are collected by the individual States, coordination of effort is required to avoid fractionation of that data base."
