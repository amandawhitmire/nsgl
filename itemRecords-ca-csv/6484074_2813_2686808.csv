13,Abstract:,"Engaging scientists with K-12 and public audiences is essential for broadening ocean literacy, yet experience in effective outreach and education strategies is frequently missing from the training of undergraduate and graduate students studying the sciences. The Communicating Ocean Sciences (COS) and Communicating Ocean Sciences to Informal Audiences (COSIA) programs, developed by Center of Ocean Sciences Education Excellence - California (COSEE CA), Lawrence Hall of Science, and UC Berkeley, focus on two target audiences engaged in outreach and public education: university undergraduate and graduate students majoring in environmental, earth, marine and life sciences and educators working in both formal and informal science settings. For graduate and undergraduate students, the program structure includes weekly seminars where university students gain background in current education theory and practice, and a practicum where they present hands-on lessons in an elementary school classroom or ""on the floor"" at a local informal science education institute (ISEI). Program goals are to introduce scientists to the importance of public outreach and how their research can have ""broader impacts"" in their community; to introduce diverse university science students to possible careers in formal and informal science education; and to provide significant ocean sciences instruction and collegeage role-models for K-12 students and ISEI visitors. The COS and COSIA programs have also been modified for use outside of the university course format, including disseminating content in short workshops for university faculty, informal educators, pre-service teachers, and citizen scientists. This program serves as a model for how universities and formal and informal educational institutions can partner to enhance environmental education. We will present an overview of program implementation at the University of Washington, Western Washington University and Oregon State University, including details of partnership development strategies, mechanisms for promoting future partnerships, our dissemination models, and results from preliminary research on program effectiveness. Findings from local evaluations will be put into the context of an evaluation of COSIA and COS impacts for undergraduate and graduate students nationwide. Findings indicate that COSIA and COS experiences impact future scientists' perspectives on outreach, influence university scientists' undergraduate teaching practices, and impact educators' understanding of inquiry-based science teaching practices in both formal and informal contexts."
