12,Abstract:,"Humboldt Bay and the Eel River are located along the Pacific Coast, some 250 miles north of San Francisco, Calif. Beyond its natural beauty, this area provides valuable commercial, recreational and cultural resources for the northern part of the state. The region is an estuarine system containing diverse habitats including rivers; brackish and salt marshes; eelgrass meadows; tidal flats; large benthic areas of sand, mud and gravel; and sand and rock beaches. Although Humboldt Bay is the second largest estuary in California, it has received relatively little scientific attention to management, conservation and restoration of intertidal habitats. Prior to this project, the last habitat inventory and mapping was completed between 1970 and 1980. The Eel River Estuary is even less understood, and few studies of any kind have occurred there. Conservation and management efforts linking land and sea have been limited by a relative lack of geospatial data for intertidal and subtidal habitats. Consequently, quantified habitat mapping from new high-resolution imagery was considered a fundamental need for an integrated ecosystem approach. Several years ago, the NOAA Coastal Services Center (NOAA CSC) and the California Sea Grant Program came together to embark on an aggressive and challenging project to acquire new color digital imagery and to map the submerged habitat in the bay. Photo Science was selected for this project during the fall of 2006. Imagery was not complete, however, until the summer of 2009 because of the challenging weather conditions along the Pacific Coast combined with project requirements for acquiring the aerial imagery during very low tides."
