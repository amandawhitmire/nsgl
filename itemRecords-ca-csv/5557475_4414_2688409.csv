10,Abstract:,"Nine diterpenes have been isolated from the marine sponge ""Chelonaplysill​a"" sp. collected in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. These include six known diterpenes and three novel rearranged spongian diterpenes, chelonaplysins A, B, and C, were identified by interpretation of spectral data and chemical correlation with known compounds. Aplyviolene, and chelonaplysins B and C exhibited antimicrobial activity against the bacterium ""Bacillus subtilils""."
