12,Abstract:,"A report on the University of California Sea Grant College Program for September 1, 1975 to August 31, 1976. In 1966, the Sea Grant Program was created by Public Law 89-688, the National Sea Grant College and Program Act. The purpose of the Act is to accelerate development of marine resources, including their conservation, management, and maximum social and economic utilization. To meet these ends, Sea Grant supports advisory services, education, and research, primarily through a national network of universities that are designed as Sea Grant Institutions or Colleges. During the brief 10-year history of Sea Grant, the California Sea Grant College Program has systematically grown from a collection of separate projects throughout the state into a coordinated statewide effort to help meet the practical marine-resource needs of its citizens. The Program is administered by the University of California Institute of Marine Resources (IMR). Policy guidance is provided by the IMR Advisory Council appointed by the President of the University of California, which consists of university and non-university members. Marine and coastal advisory services are provided statewide through the UC Cooperative Extension offices located in each county and the participating campuses. Practical marine-research experience is provided to about 65 graduate students each year in association with Sea Grant supported research projects. These projects reflect the areas we have chosen to emphasize: coastal planning and management; aquaculture; fisheries development, enhancement, and management; energy; and the development of new products from marine sources. Projects in these subject areas are conducted at six UC campuses, San Diego State University, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, CSU-Northridge, and, beginning this year, Stanford and Humboldt State University. A refreshing aspect of the Sea Grant Program is that within the broad field of applied work, each Sea Grant college chooses the areas of emphasis that best suit its capabilities and the needs of its local area. Since the University of California is one of a limited number of national research universities, we are responsive to national as well as state needs. This dual approach, we feel, not only allows us to seek broader solutions to identified local needs, but also encourages the generation of fundamental knowledge that can be applied to a wide class of problems. In this way, we believe we best serve all citizens through the interdisciplinaâ€‹ry and intercampus Sea Grant approach. As we move into the next decade, the cooperative links forged among government, industry, universities, and the public need to be further strengthened. The continual interaction among members of these sectors of society enhances the knowledge and wisdom of each, resulting in bettr understanding of what the real problems are. Thereby, a coordinated, cooperative approach to developing effective solutions can be mounted by those most informed. Accordingly, we will continue to seek out the best talents statewide, to welcome new participants in these endeavors, and we invite you to join with us (James J. Sullivan, Program Manager)."
