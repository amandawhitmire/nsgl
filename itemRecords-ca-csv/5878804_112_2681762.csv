14,Abstract:,"The Bight Bulletin is a new quarterly, bilingual newsletter addressing water quality, coastal watersheds and habitats. The goal of the newsletter is to provide a mechanism for information exchange in the Southern California Bight for local, state and federal officials, educators, students, and non-​governmental organizations working towards reducing the impact of pollution and habitat loss on the coastal environment. This is a joint effort of the San Diego Association of Governments, the California Sea Grant College Program, with additional support from the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, and the Direccion General de Ecologia Estatal de Baja California. Some articles of interest in these issues: Monitoring coastal waters from Tijuana to Ensenada, by J. Vinicio Macias-Zamora; Escalera Nautica: Staircase to Baja California, by Mark J. Spalding; Huntington Beach water quality studies, by Phyllis Grifman; Marine protected areas in Southern California, by Kate Wing; History of heavy metal loading from the Tijuana River Watershed, by R. Gersberg; New antifouling strategies needed to prevent copper pollution from recreational boats, by Leigh Taylor Johnson; Tijuana-Tecate industrial pretreatment and wastewater treatment program, by C.
