11,Abstract:,"The Dungeness crab fishery, which extends from central California to Alaska, experienced a northward expansion in the early 1980s. This research fills in life history information gaps on Dungeness crabs in the northern part of their range. The authors measured survival, feeding rates, and growth of juvenile crabs in the laboratory. One notable result is that Dungeness crabs show longer intermolt periods progressively northward."
