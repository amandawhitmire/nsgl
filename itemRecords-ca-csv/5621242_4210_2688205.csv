11,Abstract:,"The University of California Bodega Marine Laboratory obtains gravid female lobsters (""Homarus americanus"") from a variety of sources. The laboratory also maintains its own broodstock. Continuous production of larvae can be achieved using a combination of temperature and photoperiod to orchestrate the reproductive cycle of females to schedule egg extrusions throughout the year. This publication renews successful larval culture techniques."
