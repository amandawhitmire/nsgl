9,Abstract:,"Actinobacteria are consistently observed in metagenomic and PCR-based, culture independent studies of marine environments. They are also readily cultured from marine samples. An analysis of existing sequence data reveals remarkable levels of uncultured Actinobacterial diversity including major phylogenetic lineages within the Acidimicrobidae​, as well as new actinomycete taxa that can be readily cultured from marine samples. Among cultured taxa is the recently described genus Salinispora. Members of this genus have proven to be a robust source of secondary metabolites including salinosporamide A, which is nearing completion of phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent. Salinispora strains exhibit a cosmopolitan distribution in marine sediments and produce secondary metabolites in species-​specific patterns that are maintained on a global scale. These observations suggest that speciation is due to ecological differentiation and that secondary metabolites provide a competitive advantage or opportunities for niche expansion. Comparative analyses of the S. tropica and S. arenicola genome sequences reveal metabolic features that differentiate the species and evidence for the genetic basis of marine adaptation. These results will be discussed in the context of the roles of gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer in genome evolution and the development of effective natural product discovery strategies."
