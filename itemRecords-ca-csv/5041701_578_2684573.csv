12,Abstract:,"Dr. Floyd Durham, a research biologist at the Hancock Foundation of the University of Southern California, has been studying bowhead whales for the past thirteen years. He has worked with Eskimo whaling crews at Barrow almost every year since 1961, and has visited other whaling villages from Wales to Barter Island. In this paper, Dr. Durham describes the various hunting techniques used by whalers on the Arctic coast from prehistoric times to the present. He then discusses the effects of these various techniques and of international whaling laws upon the contemporary Eskimo whale harvest."
