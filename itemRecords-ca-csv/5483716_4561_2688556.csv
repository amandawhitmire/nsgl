11,Abstract:,"As a result of their intrinsic antimicrobial properties, hydroquinones and quinones have been isolated fairly frequently from marine sponges. A recent report suggesting that avarol and the corresponding quinone, avarone, `may prove to be useful in the treatment of patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex' has led to heightened interest in this class of marine natural products. While evaluating sponges as sources of ilimaquinone for HIV screening, the authors encountered a specimen of ""Dactylospongia​"" sp. that contained five new compounds in addition to ilimaquinone and dictyoceratin-​A, which is a metabolite of ""Hippospongia"" sp. Four of the new metabolites, dactylospongeno​nes A-D, are ring-contracted derivatives of ilimaquinone and the remaining compounds dictyoceratin-​C, is related to dictyoceratin-​A."
