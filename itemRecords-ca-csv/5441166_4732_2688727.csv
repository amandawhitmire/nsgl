11,Abstract:,"A study of tissue and cell water content was carried out on eyestalk-​ablated (EA) and intact juvenile lobsters. Both parameters were significantly higher in abdominal muscle and hepatopancreas from EA lobsters; similarly, the extracellular tissue spaces were larger as were estimates of total hemolymph volume. Hemolymph density and dry solids content were less than controls, although hemolymph osmotic pressures of both groups were indistinguishab​le. Results are discussed in relation to other studies on the effects of eyestalk ablation. Possible osmoregulatory and endocrine consequences are also considered."
