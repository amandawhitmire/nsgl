8,Abstract:,"Students often imagine oceanographers and marine biologists working at sea on a beautiful sunny day. Marine science can include exciting field work, but also includes much time in a laboratory or at a computer terminal. There are few jobs in ocean sciences and they require years of math and science studies. If you want an ocean-related career, but think that science is not for you, you're lucky to have many choices. For example, you might go into business or journalism, or represent a trade association; some other jobs are fishing or marine contracting, shipping, customs brokering, and seafood marketing, to name a few. Ocean-related careers, both scientific and non-scientific, are listed here, with examples of each type."
