9,Abstract:,"The Humboldt Bay Initiative (HBI) is a diverse, multidisciplina​ry team formed in 2007 to develop an ecosystem based approach to coastal resource management. HBI completed a formal strategic planning process in 2009. Six priority ecosystem-based management (EBM) strategies were developed based on identification of ""EBM targets"" and threats to those targets. Two strategies have been implemented: Strategy A: Establish the Humboldt Bay Initiative and Strategy B: Coordinated Response to Coastal and Climate Change. The remaining four strategies are in various planning phases or not yet active."
