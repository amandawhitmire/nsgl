9,Abstract:,"Pathogenic fungi have been selected over the years as sources of cell-​wall-​degrading enzymes and used for production of protoplasts from a variety of land plants. Pathogenic fungi are known to attack seaweeds but studies on their enzymatic activities are not available. The present study reports fungal infections on brown and red seaweeds, which penetrated through the hosts' intercellular matrices and cell walls, but did not appear to dissolve them. It also reports an amoeba which completely digested various brown and red seaweeds including their walls and cuticles, and is thus considered a promising source for seaweed-​cell-​wall-​degrading enzymes."
