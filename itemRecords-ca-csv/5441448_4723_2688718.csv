9,Abstract:,A previous study suggested that soy lecithin may be required by hatchery-​produced juvenile white sturgeon for good growth. The beneficial growth effects observed in sturgeon fed the diet with 8% soy lecithin may have resulted from the choline moiety of the phosphatidylcho​line rather than the lecithin per se. Results from this experiment suggest that there is not a lecithin requirement but there is a choline requirement for good growth of hatchery-​produced juvenile (11-34 g) white sturgeon.
