13,Abstract:,"The sooty shearwater is a gull-sized seabird, related to the albatrosses, that crosses the Pacific Ocean to feed on abundant forage fishes (e.g., anchovy) in the California Current. Sooties use persistent ocean winds to traverse tens of thousands of miles each year from nesting colonies in New Zealand and Chile. Swarming birds occasionally blacken the horizon along our coast during late summer when they gather in flocks approaching a million individuals."
