9,Abstract:,"The author of this paper tells us why deliberations about future ocean policy must take into account the considerable changes in the world political and economic system since 1989-​-​globalization with its rapid transportation, communication, economic interdependence​; population increase; increased pressure on the stock of the world's natural resources and spaces; the end of the Cold War but with diffusion of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons; and a rise in world environmental consciousness. It is in this context that models of sustainable use must be developed. Political and economic costs, and how to achieve outcomes consistent with the principles set forth are just some of the issues not yet fully understood in ocean governance."
