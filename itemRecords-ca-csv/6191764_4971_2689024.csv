24,Abstract:,"In 2006 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provided funds through the National Sea Grant College Program to develop regional plans in coastal regions around the country. The Washington, Oregon, California, and University of Southern California Sea Grant programs partnered to develop a marine research and information plan for the West Coast region. This report covers the first phase of the process and presents research and information needs identified by regional stakeholders. It can be used by federal, state, tribal, and local agencies for planning and prioritizing local and regional research and information efforts. Academic institutions, private research enterprises, and nongovernmental organizations will also find this report helpful for linking to regional stakeholder needs and identifying a regional context for existing or planned work. The goal of this report is to establish priorities that foster collaboration among a full range of regional information providers and end users."
