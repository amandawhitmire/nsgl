9,Abstract:,"Naturally occurring sesterterpenes were first encountered less than thirty years ago, and as a consequence they are often viewed as a rare category of natural products. Since then, there have been reports of numerous other new sesterterpenes with the total count now standing at 158 compounds comprising 21 major carbon frameworks and 11 modified ones; the sesterterpene class can no longer be considered as rare. The many recent developments in sesterterpene chemistry have prompted the present review. Discussions consider important chemical as well as biological aspects and also cover some aspects of structure elucidation, especially insights which can be obtained from 13C-NMR data. The literature is covered up to September 1984."
