10,Abstract:,The relationship between frequency and wavelength for waves traveling on a sheared current has been explored in a laboratory flume. Shifts in wavenumber occur due to the rotational contribution to the shear in addition to the Doppler shift of the mean flow. Measured changes in wavenumber due to positive and negative shears (shear is created upstream of the wavemaker by curved screens) agree with the dispersion relation described by Miles (1960).
