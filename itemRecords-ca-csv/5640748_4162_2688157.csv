10,Abstract:,"The effects of eyestalk ablation, cheliped amputation, and rearing conditions on molt increment and scute density were studied in larvae of the lobster ""Homarus americanus"". Results indicated that the growth-â€‹promoting effect of eyestalk ablation was mainly a result of the increased surface area of epicuticle produced by each epidermal cell and that the postmolt size of intact larvae was predetermined mainly by the number of epidermal cells present before molt."
