9,Abstract:,"Pinnipeds generally exhibit four different feeding modes: biting, grip-and-tear, suction, and filter feeding. However, little is known regarding how variation in skull shape is correlated to feeding modes in aquatic mammals. We hypothesized that skull shape is correlated with feeding mode in basal otariids. Cranial shapes of four species (Northern fur seals, Callorhinus ursinus; Southern sea lions, Otaria byronia; Stellar sea lions, Eumetopius jubatus; and California sea lions, Zalophus californianus) was investigated using a multivariate statistical analysis known as geometric morphometrics. Scaled digital photographs of specimens were collected and homologous landmarks were digitized for all species. Resulting coordinates were scaled, rotated and a Procrustes General Linear Model applied to every specimen, leaving only shape differences. A permutated Goodall F statistic showed that skull shape differed significantly between sexes (p<0.01). A Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) demonstrated that dorsal and lateral aspects of Southern and Stellar sea lions grouped together in morphospace, but diverged ventrally with Northern fur seals and California sea lions emerging as a distinct group. Stellar and Southern sea lion ventral skull morphology occupied separate morphospace regions. The first CVA axis appears to represent a suction-biting continuum and results agree with available feeding performance data."
