9,Abstract:,"The selection of a sanitizer depends on the type of equipment to be sanitized, the hardness of the water, the application equipment available, the effectiveness of the sanitizer under site conditions, and the cost. Sanitizing compounds which contain phenols impart strong undesirable odors and flavors and should not be used. This pamphlet describes some approved sanitizers and situations in which they're used."
