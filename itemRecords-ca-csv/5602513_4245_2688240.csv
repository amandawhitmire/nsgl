10,Abstract:,Mini-ROVs are the newest and most numerous class of underwater remotely operated vehicles. The combination of small size and low cost makes vehicles in this class uniquely suited to many marine science applications. Recent research has aimed at developing the capabilities of mini-ROVs to meet the needs of marine scientists. A major part of this work has been the development of a new underwater manipulator which is compatible with a mini-ROV in terms of size and cost. The prototype system is described in this paper.
