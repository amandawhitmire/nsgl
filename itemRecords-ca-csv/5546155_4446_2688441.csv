11,Abstract:,Knowledge about the specifics of salmonid developmental endocrinology has radically advanced in the last decade. Concern about the quality of hatchery-â€‹produced smolts led to the first Workshop on Smoltification in Pacific Salmonids which was held in October 1977. This short report summarizes the workshops and studies that have followed. The role played by Howard Bern in advancing basic understanding of salmonid endocrinology is detailed.
