10,Abstract:,"The objective of this investigation was to examine whether exposure of red (""Haliotis rufescens"") and black (""H. cracherodii"") abalone to combined natural and chemical stressors can compromise hemocyte microbicidal activity. Microbicidal phagocytic function was examined after in vivo exposure to 25, 35, and 45% seawater salinity plus 1.2 mg/l PCP using luminol-​dependent chemiluminescen​ce. Red and black abalone exposures of 3.5 and 6.5 h respectively, were based on species-​specific metabolic endpoints (MEPs) derived from previous NMR data. Results helped the authors assess the validity of the MEPs as they relate to immune function."
