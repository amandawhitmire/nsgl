12,Abstract:,"Underwater robotic vehicles (URVs) are the integration of various subsystems such as sensor systems and guidance and control systems. In the Autonomous Systems Laboratory, an autonomous URV was designed and its first model was built as a part of research in developing a test platform for advanced vehicle technologies. Major components of the vehicle and its mechanical and electrical structure are described"
