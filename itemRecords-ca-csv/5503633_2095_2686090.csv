9,Abstract:,"Recent advances in satellite image processing have greatly expanded the utility of remote sensing in oceanography. One new technique is the estimation of surface flow from visible or infrared image time series. In the study described here, sat ellite-derived velocity measurements were compared with velocities of surface drogues deployed in two regions along the California coast. A refined procedure for the calculation of surface flow velocities from satellite IR and visible images is pr esented, and the advantages and limitations of the technique are discussed. Although velocities obtained from AVHRR infrared and CZCS visible images may not always represent flow at the same depth, the measurements were practically identical with th e data used."
