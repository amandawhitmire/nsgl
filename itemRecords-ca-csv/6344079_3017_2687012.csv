10,Abstract:,"What's the easiest way to detect high quality seafood? Smell it! The nose knows. If the seafood smells a little fishy... it is not a good idea to think that your customer won't notice. It may steer them away from coming back. Know your supplier and be sure to rotate your stock, first in--first out. Fresh seafood should smell like the ocean breeze. The following discusses annual sensory evaluation courses for seafood decomposition and the sensory protocol developed by federal inspectors to assure that oil tainted seafood from the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico did not enter into commerce."
