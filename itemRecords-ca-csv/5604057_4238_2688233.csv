10,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of galvanically coupling a graphite-​reinforced epoxy composite to magnesium in fresh Pacific seawater. Moisture absorption of coupled specimens was monitored and compared with moisture uptake in soaked specimens. Post-exposure fracture in 4-point bending was used to determine any reduction in the interlaminar shear strength of the composite. Chemical changes in the damaged polymer matrix were then evaluated using infrared spectroscopy, and likely damage mechanisms were postulated. Techniques for avoiding galvanic coupling damage in composites are suggested."
