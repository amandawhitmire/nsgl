10,Abstract:,"The sesquiterpenoid methyl farnesoate (MF) is synthesized by crustacean mandibular organs and is present in the hemolymph. The chemical structure of MF is nearly identical to that of insect juvenile hormone III, differing only by the absence of an epoxide group. The functions of MF in crustaceans have been elusive, in part because the mandibular organs of most species are difficult to ablate. However, three roles of MF have emerged from a growing body of literature. They are (a) stimulation of general protein synthesis; (b) promotion of the molt cycle; and (c) reproduction in both males and females. These functions are not universal; rather, they reflect the diversity of the crustaceans that have been studied to date. This review synthesizes aspects of what is known about MF in crustaceans and outlines some current avenues of research."
