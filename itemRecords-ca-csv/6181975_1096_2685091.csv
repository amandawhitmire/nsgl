9,Abstract:,"Fish communities at sub-tidal reefs and kelp beds at Santa Cruz Island in the Santa Barbara Channel change in response to shifts in oceanic conditions associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), a long-lived El Ni�o-like pattern of variability in the northern Pacific Ocean. During the ""warm"" phase of the PDO, there is a greater abundance of ""southern"" fish species and a concomitant decrease in fishes normally associated with more northerly waters. The opposite occurs during ""cool"" periods. The researcher who led this project has also identified certain fish species that are especially affected by climatic variability and/or by the loss of giant kelp, which occurs during warm-water periods. Because these species may be commercially or recreationally exploited, the findings from this project can help ensure that fisheries are adaptively managed to sustain resources and ecosystem integrity under a range of environmental conditions. Noteworthy, although several studies have attributed declining fish populations in California to an overall decline in primary and secondary productivity within the California Current system, no such general downward trend in fish abundance was observed in this project from 1971 to 2005."
