9,Abstract:,"Humboldt State University has held a Coherent Area Project under the National Sea Grant Act since 1969. The program is best described by its title, development of Living Marine Resources of Northern California."" The strong natural resources programs of the university — especially fisheries science, oceanography, marine biology, and wildlife management — provide a pool of talent (both faculty and student) particularly suited for such a program. Humboldt is also the only 4-year institution on the California coast between San Francisco and the Oregon border; proximity to the important fishing ports of Fort Bragg, Eureka, Trinidad, and Crescent City, as well as the short distances to several important salmonid spawning .streams along the North Coast, gives additional relevance and value to the Humboldt State Coherent Area Project. This annual report is for the 1973-1974 grant that supported four research projects and the Marine Advisory-​Extension Service."
