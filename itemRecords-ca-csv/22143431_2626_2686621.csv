9,Abstract:,"November, in the final official weeks of autumn, a blast of frigid air from the Arctic swept across Maine and the northern United States. The cold, which was likened to a Siberian express freight train, brought below-​zero temperatures before winter had officially arrived. The polar vortex is a counterclockwis​e flow that usually keeps cold air over the Arctic. When it weakens, waves of cold air spill south into Maine. It is a chilling reminder of Maine’s many connections to the great white north, connections that are being magnified and altered now in ways we can see—and feel. The Arctic is melting. With only a thin skin of ice remaining, or no ice at all in many areas, sunlight on the surface of the Arctic Ocean fuels the growth of phytoplankton. Winds blowing across the water mix layers of water and nutrients that once stayed separate under the ice, increasing the annual production of algae 47 percent in the last 20 years, according to a recent analysis by researchers at the Scripps Institute for Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. The research is ongoing, and many Maine scientists are involved. But even scientists are struggling to keep up with the changes, such as the luffing of the polar vortex and its eastward movement over Eurasia. The change in atmospheric circulation is impacting Maine’s climate, according to Maine State Climatologist Sean Birkel. As the air over the Arctic warms, there is less of a temperature difference between the North Pole and the equator. This temperature difference, or gradient, is what generates the polar vortex and the westerly winds that drive our weather."
