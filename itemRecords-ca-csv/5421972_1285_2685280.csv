9,Abstract:,"Pseudopterosin A is a diterpene riboside isolated from ""Pseudopterogorâ€‹gia bipinata"", a soft coral of the order Gorgonacea. Pseudopterosin A inhibits the first cleavage in fertilized sea urchin eggs. Cytological examination revealed that sea urchin embryos did not progress beyond early prophase. Notably, the nuclear envelope remained intact and chromatin was condensed into chromosomes in the arrested embryos. These synchronously dividing embryos did not show any abnormalities such as lysis, swelling, or morphological changes different from control embryos."
