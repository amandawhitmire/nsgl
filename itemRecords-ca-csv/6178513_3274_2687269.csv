9,Abstract:,"The delineation of groups of related organisms into species provides a useful framework within which to evaluate biological diversity, biogeographical distributions, and ecological and evolutionary processes. Species are generally recognized as the fundamental units of diversity, however the criteria by which they have been delineated among prokaryotes are often inconsistent, highly conservative, and at times controversial. In this presentation, sediment inhabiting marine actinomycetes belonging to the recently described genus Salinispora will be used as a model to address species concepts in bacteria. Strains within this genus have been cultured from global locations and share > 99% similarity in the 16S rRNA gene. Despite this high level of similarity, three fundamental lineages with distinct biogeographical distributions have been resolved and characterized as species. DNA:DNA hybridization, average nucleotide identity (ANI), and phylogenetic analysis of a protein coding gene all support the classification of three species within the genus. Phenotypic analyses reveal that secondary metabolite biosynthesis represents one of the fundamental differences among the species and suggest that the production of specific metabolites may play a role in ecological differentiation among co-occurring lineages. Comparative genomics support the phenotypic observations and reveal that the vast majority of unique genes occur in genomic islands. Despite evidence of HGT, species-â€‹specific secondary metabolites are fixed within widely distributed populations as would be predicted following a selective sweep. If these results can be applied more broadly to the fine-scale phylogenetic architecture typically observed among marine bacteria, it would suggest that global species diversity has been dramatically underestimated."
