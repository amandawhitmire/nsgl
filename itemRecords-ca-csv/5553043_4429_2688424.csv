11,Abstract:,"To further understand ecdysteroid metabolism in crustaceans and their embryos, a study was initiated using the Dungeness crab, ""Cancer magister"", and the yellow rock crab, ""C. anthonyi""; despite being congeners, these crabs exhibit different reproductive behaviors. The purposes of this study were to determine whether (1) embryonic ecdysteroid fluctuations follow the same pattern as reported in other brachyuran crabs; (2) embryonic ecdysteroids show differential fluctuations based upon the reproductive adaptation of the species; and (3) ecdysteroid molecules demonstrate changes during reproduction and embryogenesis in the two crab species."
