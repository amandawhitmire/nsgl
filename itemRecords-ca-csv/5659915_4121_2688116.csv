12,Abstract:,"This fact sheet discusses paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins and domoic acid, phytoplankton-​produced marine toxins. Marine animals that filter their food from seawater may accumulate these toxins, which don't appear to directly harm the animals, but people or other predators eating toxic seafoods may become poisoned. PSP toxins and domoic acid are powerful nerve poisons with no taste or odor. There is no visible difference between toxic and safe seafoods. Cleaning seafoods in many cases will not remove the toxins, and cooking does not destroy them."
