9,Abstract:,"Despite the importance of anhydrobiotic organisms in everyday life and the importance of understanding the role of water in living systems, we understand surprisingly little of the mechanisms by which some organisms are capable of surviving dehydration. The authors try to elucidate some of these mechanisms and describe their progress in this review over the past several years. In view of the complexity of desiccation tolerance, they have adopted a decidedly reductionistic approach to the problem and have been studying effects of dehydration on subcellular components and molecules, particularly biological membranes, and the ways in which membranes might be stabilized in anhydrobiotic organisms."
