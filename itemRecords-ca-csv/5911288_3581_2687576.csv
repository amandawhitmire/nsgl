12,Abstract:,"Clavanins are antimicrobial peptides that were isolated from a mixed population of ""Styela clava"" hemocytes. To learn which types of hemocytes contained clavanins, scientists raised a polyclonal antibody that recognized five different clavanins, and used it to localize these peptides by light and electron microscopy."
