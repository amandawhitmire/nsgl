11,Abstract:,"The coastal zone in the vicinity of the Tijuana River Estuary is a morphologically dynamic inlet-barrier beach system which supports delicate dune and wetland ecosystems. The quality of these ecosystems is a function of the direct passage of tidal flows into the slough arms within the estuary. The slough arms extend laterally from the inlet and run parallel to and behind the backshore of the barrier beach; they are susceptible to barrier overwash and sedimentation during extreme wave conditions. The storm that hit the southern California coast in January 1988 provided an excellent opportunity for studying the effects of storms on an inlet-barrier beach system. Field observations, topographic surveys and aerial photographs were made before and after the storm. The findings illustrate the complexity of processes that interact to influence the stability of coastal inlets, and underscore the need to take a systems approach when trying to manage them."
