7,Abstract:,"A variety of evidence suggests that cortisol and growth hormone (GH) are functionally linked in mammalian species. Evidence for a close functional relationship in teleosts is more indirect but cortisol stimulates GH secretion by the pituitary of tilapia (""Oreochromis mossambicus"") in-vitro as it does in mammals. This study employed an in-vitro method, using cortisol secretion as an endpoint, to examine whether GH influences interrenal activity of coho salmon and, if so, to determine whether its action is direct or indirect."
