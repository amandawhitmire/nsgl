11,Abstract:,"The continental U.S. West Coast (USWC) abuts a collection of eastern boundary currents called the California Current System. Recent satellite and drifter observations indicate that intrinsic variability of the persistent currents plays an important role in cross-shore transport of material properties that have human importance for fisheries, water quality, shoreline control, and shipping operations. The Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) was developed to simulate such phenomena. Here physicists report on ROMS simulations of the equilibrium, seasonal-cycle, USWC circulation that are of interest both for the mean-seasonal circulation itself and as a clean demonstration of intrinsic circulation variability."
