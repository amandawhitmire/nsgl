11,Abstract:,"To determine the appropriate size of marine reserves and the distances between reserves, an understanding of the requirements for persistence of local populations is required. Understanding the robustness of theoretical results to larval dispersal is of key importance. Larval dispersal is represented by a probability distribution that defines the fraction of successful settlers from an arbitrary location, the origin of the distribution, to any other location along the coast. The authors formulate models based on integrodifferenâ€‹ce equations that are spatially continuous and temporally discrete. The effects of different dispersal patterns are considered for a single isolated reserve of varying size, and for multiple reserves with varying degrees of connectivity. While different patterns result in quantitative differences in persistence, qualitatively similar effects across all patterns are seen in both single and multiple reserve models."
