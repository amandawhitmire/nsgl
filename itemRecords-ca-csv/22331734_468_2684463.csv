8,Abstract:,"Growing Effort, Growing Challenge: The third coastal adaptation needs assessment, administered in 2016, provides a snapshot of the current state of coastal adaptation in California, and an assessment of the changing needs of coastal professionals since 2006. The study aimed to (1) understand the state and context of coastal adaptation and understand how to move it forward; (2) identify information, training, technical assistance, financial and other support needs; and in so doing, (3) assess what difference past technical and financial assistance have made in advancing coastal adaptation. This report is included in California’s Fourth Climate Change Assessment report, released in August, 2018. This fact sheet contains highlights of 1) Overaching findings for coastal California; and 2) Regionally Differentiated Findings. In summary, while regional representation in the survey was uneven (reflecting limits in existing lists of coastal professionals to whom the survey could be distributed), the emerging picture from all responses suggests that the urbanized areas are farther along with adaptation, thus relatively greater attention needs to be given in the future to the less densely populated, rural coastal regions with additional technical assistance and other support (trainings, outreach, backing of political leaders etc.). Such unevenness in capacity can magnify the challenges that all regions report, namely lack of funding for planning and implementation, and staff capacity constraints in light of concurrent other pressing issues."
