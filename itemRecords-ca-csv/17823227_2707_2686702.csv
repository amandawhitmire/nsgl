14,Abstract:,"The xenoestrogen 4-nonylphenol (NP) is a ubiquitous aquatic pollutant and has been shown to impair reproduction, development, growth and, more recently, immune function in marine invertebrates. We investigated the effects of short-term (7 d) exposure to low (2 μg l−1) and high (100 μg l−1) levels of NP on cellular and humoral elements of the innate immune response of Crassostrea gigas to a bacterial challenge. To this end, we measured 1) total hemocyte counts (THC), 2) relative transcript abundance of ten immune-related genes (defh1, defh2, bigdef1, bigdef2, bpi, lysozyme-1, galectin, C-type lectin 2, timp, and trans​glutaminase) in the hemocytes, gill and mantle, and 3) hemolymph plasma lysozyme activity, following experimental Vi​brio campbellii infe​ction. Both low and high levels of NP were found to repress a bacteria-​induced increase in THC observed in the control oysters. While several genes were differentially expressed following bacterial introduction (bigdef2, bpi, lysozyme-1, timp, transglutaminas​e), only two genes (bpi in the hemocytes, tran​sglutaminase in​ the mantle) exhibited a different bacteria-​induced expression profile following NP exposure, relative to the control oysters. Independently of infection-​status, exposure to NP also altered mRNA transcript abundance of several genes (bpi, galectin, C-type lectin 2) in naïve, saline-injected oysters. Finally, plasma lysozyme activity levels were significantly higher in low dose NP-treated oysters (both naïve and bacteria challenged) relative to control oysters. Combined, these results suggest that exposure to ecologically-​relevant (low) and extreme (high) levels of NP can alter both cellular and humoral elements of the innate immune response in C. gigas, an aquaculture species of global economic importance."
