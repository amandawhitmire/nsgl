23,Abstract:,"Sargassum horneri (Turner) C. Agardh, 1820 is a fast growing brown alga native to shallow reefs of eastern Asia. It has spread aggressively throughout southern California, USA, and Baja California, México since it was discovered in the eastern Pacific in 2003 and poses a major threat to the sustainability of native marine ecosystems in this region. Here we present a chronology of the rapid geographic expansion of S. horneri in the eastern Pacific and discuss factors that potentially influence its spread."
