16,Abstract:,"A comprehensive understanding of the life-​history strategies and habitat use of species is essential for developing accurate ecological models and effective management and conservation strategies. For example, omitting critical habitats of endangered species when estimating their abundance and when designing conservation plans can severely limit our understanding of population dynamics and lead to poor management outcomes. Here we describe important new observations of the distribution and habitat use of Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) in the San Francisco Estuary, California, USA."
