10,Abstract:,"Understanding the mechanisms of biogenic formation of composite materials could lead to the development of new synthetic high-​performance materials with controlled and modular properties. Purified proteins from molluscan shells have been used to grow calcite and aragonite, and kinetic studies performed with atomic force microscopy gave insight into the growth process. Here the authors discuss the ""in vitro"" self-assembly of proteins with these two polymorphic forms of calcium carbonate."
