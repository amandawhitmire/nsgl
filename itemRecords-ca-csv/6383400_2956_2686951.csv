6,Abstract:,"Ocean literacy is an understanding of the ocean’s influence on you—and your influence on the ocean. An ocean-literate person: • understands the Essential Principles and Fundamental Concepts about the functioning of the ocean; • can communicate about the ocean in a meaningful way; and • is able to make informed and responsible decisions regarding the ocean and its resources. Developed through a community-wide consensus-​building process, this definition along with the Essential Principles and supporting Fundamental Concepts build on previous efforts to define ocean literacy, assess what the public knows about the ocean, and redress the lack of ocean related content in state and national science education standards, instructional materials and assessments. The Essential Principles and Fundamental Concepts outlined in this guide (inside) represent content that does not always fall neatly within particular disciplines. As a result, many Fundamental Concepts illustrate more than one Essential Principle. For example, Essential Principle 4 lists only two Fundamental Concepts; however, several others could be listed as well. This is unavoidable and demonstrates the interdisciplina​ry nature of ocean sciences."
