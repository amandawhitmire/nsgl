10,Abstract:,"The recognition of sibling species throughout the world oceans has gained attention in recent years. The identification of species that are difficult to distinguish by morphology alone is clearly important to understanding the ecology of a system. The ability to distinguish closely related but apparently identical marine invertebrate species is critical to bioprospecting for pharmaceuticals from the sea and understanding the chemical ecology of the community. One of the obstacles in efforts to find potential drugs is the inconsistent recovery of compounds from different collections of the same organism. Although the cosmopolitan marine bryozoan ""Bugula neritina"" is recognized as a single species, natural products from this bryozoan vary among populations. ""B. neritina"" is the source of the anticancer drug candidate bryostatin 1, but it also produces other bryostatins, and different populations contain different bryostatins. In this study, ""B. neritina"" populations along the California coast were sampled for genetic variation and bryostatin content."
