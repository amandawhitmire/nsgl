9,Abstract:,"The marine natural product manoalide (MLD), a potent irreversible inhibitor of bee venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2), was shown to produce a chromophore during incubation with the enzyme. MLD also developed an identical chromophore when incubated with free lysine, cysteine, or tryptophan, but not with their ""N""-​alpha-​amino-​blocked analogs. The present study investigates the structural (or spatial) requirements for the reactivity of MLD with free amino acids, amino acid derivatives, Lys peptides and PLA2 inactivation. The purpose of these investigations was designed to explain, on a molecular basis, factors that may contribute to the complex kinetics observed during the inactivation of bee venom."
