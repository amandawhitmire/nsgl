10,Abstract:,"Seiches in small harbors are standing waves at the frequencies of the harbor normal modes. Large oscillatory horizontal displacements caused by these low frequency oscillations can seriously interfere with harbor operations. Field data sets specifically designed to study seiches recently collected at three small harbors in California and Hawaii are discussed here. Numerical model predictions of seiche amplification are compared to observations in one harbor, and ongoing research directions are also discussed."
