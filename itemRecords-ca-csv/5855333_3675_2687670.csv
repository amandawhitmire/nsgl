10,Abstract:,"Biologists used the specialist marine herbivore ""Alderia modesta"" to compare the behavior of developmentally distinct larvae in response to a key environmental stimulus. Competent larvae were tested for behavioral responses to dissolved chemical cues from the adult host algae to address two questions: (i) do larvae have an immediate behavioral response to a waterborne cue of habitat suitability, and (ii) do differences exist in the behavior patterns expressed by larvae of the two development modes? Behavior was quantified using computer- assisted video motion analysis for the two larval morphs swimming both in the water column and just above the bottom. Bioassays were conducted in parallel with the dissolved cue to determine the minimum dose and exposure time sufficient to induce metamorphosis. The results are discussed with regard to both the ecological role of larval behavior during settlement and the challenges imposed by the different life-history strategies of planktotrophy and lecithotrophy in this dimorphic species."
