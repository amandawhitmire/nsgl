15,Abstract:,"A modified allomone collecting apparatus was designed that could be used under water with a scuba tank. This apparatus provides a simple method of obtaining naturally secreted chemicals from benthic marine organisms at scuba depths, without the necessity of using a bilge pump. Organic material from Sep-paks in the allomone collector confirmed the release of secondary metabolites from a soft coral into the surrounding water."
