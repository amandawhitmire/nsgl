9,Abstract:,"It is generally accepted that coastal streams are the major source of beach sand for the coast of southern California, and for most beaches in the temperate latitudes. The working hypothesis here is that most of the sand-sized sediment delivery occurs during very large, infrequent storm flow events. The objectives of this research were: (1) to develop and test a numerical modeling technique for estimating sand delivery through the mouth of a coastal stream; and (2) to quantify the magnitude-​frequency relationship of sand delivery by a specific coastal stream (San Dieguito River) in southern California."
