12,Abstract:,"The authors of this study developed an assay to monitor Golgi fragmentation in permeabilized normal rat kidney cells using extracts made from mitotic cells. Under experimental conditions, Golgi membranes lost their perinuclear location and were found as punctuate structures dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Continued presence of the mitosis initiation kinase is not necessary for fragmentation, which is found to depend instead on cytosolic mitogen-​activated protein kinase kinase 1."
