10,Abstract:,"The interactions between predators and their prey are key drivers of structure and functioning in many ecosystems. However, the ability of predators to effectively regulate prey abundance can be strongly modified by the context in which trophic interactions occur. My dissertation explores the effects of five factors which have the potential to mediate trophic interactions on nearshore reefs: prey density, organismal body size, habitat complexity, animal behavior, and fishery harvest. Working on both temperate rocky reefs and tropical coral reefs, I use field- and lab-based experiments as well as a numerical model to better understand the interactions among sea urchins, their finfish and invertebrate predators, and the nearshore reef-associated communities of which they are a part. Chapters 1 and 2 focus on the dynamics between sea urchins, spiny lobsters, and fish predators on the rocky reefs of southern California. In Chapter 3, I use benthic surveys, tethering, and laboratory experiments to show that the structural complexity and species identity of three corals commonly observed on Caribbean reefs mediate the abundance, behavior, and demographic characteristics of an increasingly important herbivore, the reef urchin Echinometra viridis. In Chapter 4, I explore the potential for non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of predatory spiny lobsters on the grazing and movement behaviors of two urchins (E. viridis and Diadema antillarum) which contribute to Caribbean coral reef resilience. Together, these chapters provide evidence of the importance of small-bodied herbivores to Caribbean coral reef resilience through feedbacks between herbivory and habitat complexity and improve our understanding of trophic interactions on degraded contemporary coral reefs.
