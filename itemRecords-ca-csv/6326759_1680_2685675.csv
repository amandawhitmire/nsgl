14,Abstract:,"Area-based fishery management and ecosystem-based management strategies are considered beneficial marine resource management tools, but they require finite information about the structure and function of ecosystems to evaluate populations and describe the effects of fishing on ecosystems. The required information is not likely to be obtained from sporadic, fishery-​dependent data collected from data-poor fisheries, and funding constraints preclude extensive fishery-​independent surveys. This situation has led to an interest in relating or combining information from a variety of disparate sampling methods. From 2003 to 2006, we investigated the relationships between estimates of catch per unit effort (CPUE) and the abundance of fishes generated from typical nearshore commercial fishing operations and estimates of density and abundance derived from scuba surveys in the same locations. The relationships between CPUE and the density estimates derived from different sampling methods were found to be statistically significant in the case of many of the common species sampled across sites in Carmel Bay, California. The compounding effects of within-sample variance and the error associated with the regression equations, however, would result in poor confidence in the values translated from one sampling method to another. Different sampling methods may provide reasonable estimates of population trends, but they are sufficiently different and variable as to preclude the use of a scaling factor to standardize population estimates among sampling methods. Also, the differences in species composition (i.e., relative CPUE or density among species) produced by each sampling method were significant and were also affected by habitat relief and sample depth. Nonetheless, our results suggest the value of a cost-benefit analysis that would allow managers to design optimal sampling strategies for characterizing CPUE relationships within a region of interest. A sampling program that benefits from the complementary strengths of fishing gear and scuba sampling will probably result in the most comprehensive description of nearshore fish assemblages."
