14,Abstract:,"This paper reviews gamete activation in the context of the general reproductive biology of ""Sicyonia ingentis"". In addition, discussed in the context of present ability to reproductively manipulate this animal, data are presented on the relationship between female molt stage and mating, the mechanisms by which sperm and eggs are brought together at spawning are described, and the results of in-vitro fertilization studies are detailed. Lastly, some perspectives are offered on future research directions."
