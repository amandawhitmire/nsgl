9,Abstract:,"Common water wave evolution equations, such as the mild slope equation, parabolic approximations and Boussinesq equations, are approximate statements of conservation laws. A feasible measure of their adequacy is their ability to predict steady progressive wave propagation over a horizontal bottom, where near-exact kinematics are predicted by steady wave theory. None of the common evolution equations satisfy the conservation laws. The relative errors are surprisingly large and no existing evolution equation is acceptable. A Boussinesq-â€‹style equation, with almost acceptable error levels, is suggested. An accurate, robust and viable water wave evolution equation for an uneven bottom is not presently available."
