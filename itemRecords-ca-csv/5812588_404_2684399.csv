19,Abstract:,"The occurrence of an unusual mortality event involving California sea lions along the central California coast in May 1998 was recently reported. The potent neurotoxin domoic acid (DA), produced naturally by the diatom ""Pseudo- nitzschia australis"" and transmitted to the sea lions via planktivorous north anchovies, was identified as the probable causative agent. In this paper, researchers describe details of DA analysis for anchovy tissues and sea lion feces including an inter-â€‹laboratory comparison of independent analysis, the use of two detection methods, and a description of problems encountered while testing these sample matrices."
