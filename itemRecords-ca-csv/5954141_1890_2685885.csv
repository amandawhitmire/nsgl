10,Abstract:,"In this experiment researchers found that the sponge ""Haliclona lunisimilis"" from Point Loma, California, contained six known chlorinated acetylenes, previously isolated from the dorid nudibranch ""Diaulula sandiegensis"", and three new metabolites. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by interpretation of spectroscopic data. The relationship between the sponge metabolites and the nudibranch metabolites is discussed here."
