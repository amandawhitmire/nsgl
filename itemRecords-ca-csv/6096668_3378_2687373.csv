7,Abstract:,"The massive decline of fish stocks during the last 100 years has created an enormous environmental problem with consequences that are poorly understood, both for the fish and for the human populations that depend upon them. There are many aspects to this marine destruction, from pollution to changing environmental conditions, but it has only been recently that the role of fishing itself has received critical examination. For much of the last century, until very recently, fishing has been seen as playing a positive role in maintaining fish populations, culling old fish and creating conditions where younger fish could grow more quickly. The eminent Victorian scientist T. H. Huxley had declared in 1883 that the great fish stocks were inexhaustible, and by 1955, many scientists still thought that fishing was part of the natural mortality that stocks faced. Even scientists who thought that some stocks were overfished believed that when fishing was relaxed, the stocks would recover."
