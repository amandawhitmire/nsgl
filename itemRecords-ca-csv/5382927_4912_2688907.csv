8,Abstract:,"In this paper, we describe the complex interactions of the molt cycle with the reproductive life of female American lobsters, the role of photoperiod, and the way in which photoperiod could be used as a probe in elucidating the nature of those interactions. Geographic variation of control of reproduction in ""Homarus"" is discussed along with a hypothesis as to why that occurs."
