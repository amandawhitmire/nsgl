8,Abstract:,"Studies of fish diets can improve the understanding of trophic distributionsan​d the predatory role of a species in an ecosystem. Identifying the spatial andtemporal variability in the diets of fishes can provide useful information for stockassessment​s and management. Yellowtail Rockfish (Sebastes flavidus) are acommercially and recreationally important fishery species, and abundant alongthe central California coast, yet the most recent studies of diets occurred over 20years ago in Oregon and Washington. To provide current information fromCalifornia, I examined the food habits of Yellowtail Rockfish collected nearCordell Bank, the Farallon Islands, and Half Moon Bay in 2013 and 2014 usinggut content and stable isotope analyses. Yellowtail Rockfish analyzed in thisstudy were semi-pelagic predators, feeding primarily on tunicates, crustaceans,and teleosts. Based on δ15N values, fish caught in 2013, on average, werefeeding at lower trophic levels than those caught in 2014, and δ13C valuesindicated that fish caught at the northern-most sites were feeding on morepelagic-​influenced carbon sources. Yellowtail Rockfish in central California canbe described as opportunistic feeders because predation patterns weretemporally localized, and diets consisted mostly of transitory prey sources. TheYellowtail Rockfish diet information presented in this study fills data gaps of a keylife history component, and will be useful for future stock assessments."
