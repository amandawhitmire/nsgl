9,Abstract:,"Freighters, oil tankers, and other large transport ships make more than 9,500 port calls in California each year. The dumping of graywater, sewage sludge, and other wastes into California's state waters poses hazards to humans, animals, and the environment. To address this situation, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger recently signed into law the Clean Coast Act (S.B. 771). The Act, approved by the Governor on October 6, 2005, prohibits certain classes of oceangoing ships from incinerating garbage or dumping oily bilgewater, graywater, sewage, sewage sludge, hazardous waste or other waste within three miles of the state's shoreline. The California Clean Coast Act will become effective January 1, 2006."
