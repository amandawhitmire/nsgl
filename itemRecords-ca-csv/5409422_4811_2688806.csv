8,Abstract:,"In this paper, a number of sampling problems for populations that have an underlying negative binomial distribution with a mean m and aggregation parameter k are discussed. It is assumed that k is known but m is unknown, with a prior distribution f0(m). The objective is to determine if m exceeds a critical level mc. Three models are introduced: presence-​absence sampling when all sampling sites are habitats, presence-​absence sampling when a site may not be a habitat, and actual updating of the mean. Both fixed sample and sequential procedures are described; the problem of knowing when a habitat has been exited is also discussed. A new model for aggregation is proposed."
