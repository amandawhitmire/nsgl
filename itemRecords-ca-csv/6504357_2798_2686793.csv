11,Abstract:,"The green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) is an anadromous species with a distinct population segment in the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento River Delta that is currently listed as threatened. Although this species is able to tolerate salinity challenges as soon as 6 mo posthatch, its ability to deal with unpredictable salinity fluctuations remains unknown. Global climate change is predicted to result in large freshwater (FW) flushes through the estuary during winter and greater tidal influence during the summer. We exposed green sturgeon acclimated to 15 (EST) or 24 (BAY) g/L salinity to a rapid FW influx, where salinity was reduced to 0 g/L in 3 h in order to simulate the effect of the ""winter"" scenario. Both groups survived, enduring a 10% plasma osmolality reduction after 3 h. BAY-acclimated sturgeon upregulated both Na!, K!-ATPase (NKA) activity and caspase 3/7 activity, but no changes were observed in the EST-acclimated fish. In addition, we exposed FW-acclimated sturgeon to a dual 12-h salinity fluctuation cycle (0-24-0 g/L) in order to simulate the effect of greater tidal influence. At 6 h, the sturgeon showed a significant increase in plasma osmolality, and branchial NKA and caspase 3/7 activities were increased, indicating an acclimation response. There was no acclimation at 18 h, and plasma osmolality was higher than the peak observed at 6 h. The second fluctuation elicited an upregulation of the stress proteins ubiquitin and heat shock 70-kDa protein (HSP 70). Sturgeon can acclimate to changes in salinity; however, salinity fluctuations resulted in substantial cellular stress"
