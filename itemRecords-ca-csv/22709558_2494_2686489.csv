18,Abstract:,"Since its 1997 Annual Meeting, PICES has become more active in nurturing young scientific talents and in recognizing the value of integrating their diverse perspectives, fresh ideas and visionary thinking into addressing important issues in the North Pacific Ocean and beyond. Early career ocean professionals (ECOPs) continue to receive support to participate in PICES- sponsored workshops and symposia, with the excellence of their oral and poster presentations regularly highlighted at PICES Annual Meetings. In the context of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021- 2030), it has been suggested that ECOPs should play a key role in disseminating PICES science and in ensuring its international leadership at the science-​policy-​society interface. To that end, efforts are needed to cultivate ECOPs’ skills and relationships, while explicitly integrating and defining their role and activities within PICES."
