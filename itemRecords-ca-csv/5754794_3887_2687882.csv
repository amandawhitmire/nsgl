13,Abstract:,"The purview of ""Developmental Biology"" is the ontogeny of the embryo-​-​describing and understanding how genes act during development, how they are controlled to turn on or off at the right time and place during embryogenesis. But there is also a ""Developmental Biology"" of the embryo-- describing and understanding the adaptations that have evolved to insure that the newly fertilized embryo will survive to become an adult. It is this biological side the authors focus on in this article. Specifically, they look at defense mechanisms that embryos of marine organisms might encounter during their development. One concerns xenobiotic or toxin defenses, and the other, pathogen defenses."
