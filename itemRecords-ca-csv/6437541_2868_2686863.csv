13,Abstract:,"Poor survival of salmonid eggs during what was considered the time of potential spring-run Chinook spawning and egg incubation (September-​November) was observed in hyporheic incubated eggs in the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam. Water temperatures appropriate for salmon egg survival did not occur consistently except for a short period towards the end of the study in November. These relatively high water temperatures may have been responsible for much of the observed poor egg survival. Hyporheic temperatures appeared to be mostly controlled by air temperature and there was very little correlation of water temperature with flow. Spatially, appropriate temperatures occurred at the furthest downstream station earlier in the season than did temperatures at upstream sites closer to the reservoir. Periphyton and fine sediment seemed to control groundwater/sur​face water interactions to some degree and low DO was sometimes associated with what appeared to be groundwater intrusion that was more common at upstream stations with large amounts of periphyton. High flows resulted in both increases and decreases in hyporheic DO concentrations. Negative impacts occurred differentially at locations in the same riffle. Lower DO often occurred with low flows at the end of the study. Some of the incubated eggplates attracted invertebrate benthos documented as harmful to fish eggs in other studies. This study has revealed that variability in hyporheic conditions is high within the studied section of the San Joaquin River."
