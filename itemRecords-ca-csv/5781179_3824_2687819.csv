9,Abstract:,"Six new cytochrome P450s are the first reported members of the CYP4 gene family from marine invertebrates, now extending the family to include molluscs and echinoderms. Members of each phyla (echinodermata, arthropoda (crustacea), and mollusca) expressed genes belonging to the CYP4C subfamily in their respective digestive tissues. A mollusc, the mussel ""Mytilus galloprovincial​is"", expressed a gene belonging to a new CYP4 subfamily, CYP4Y. In Northern blotting experiments with digestive tissues of the ""M. galloprovincial​is"", the expression of the CYP4Y1 gene was found to be inhibited by increasing concentrations of the hydrocarbon ""beta""-​naphthoflavone. The potential use of marine invertebrate CYP4 genes as biomarkers of xenobiotic exposures may be warranted."
