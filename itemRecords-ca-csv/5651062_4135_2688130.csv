12,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study is to examine further the effect of growth hormone (GH) on cartilage growth and its potential interaction with IGF-I. Ceratobranchial cartilages from coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") parr, injected with growth hormone at 4mug/g body weight or with saline, were sampled monthly from February to July. ""In vivo"" GH action and ""in vitro"" IGF-I action on ceratobranchial cartilage in coho salmon were judged by determining thymidine and sulfate incorporation. Experiments were done repeatedly during the period of parr-smolt transformation to detect possible developmental or seasonal changes in response to GH ""in vivo"" and to IGF-I ""in vitro""."
