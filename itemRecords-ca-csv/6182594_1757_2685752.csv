12,Abstract:,"In the highly urbanized region of Southern California stormwater plumes carry considerable amounts of known and unknown pollutants, and have significant effects on coastal water quality. Understanding the dynamics and transport of these stormwater plumes is essential to proper management of coastal resources. The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) is used to investigate statistically the temporal and spatial variability of typical coastal plumes in response to the ever-changing ocean environment. Plume persistence and characteristic directions of transport are identified. Derived plume dispersion and dilution rates are use to compute the cumulative impact of stormwater pollutants, such as nutrients. The results of this investigation are compared with field measurements and satellite imagery of stormwater plumes."
