9,Abstract:,"In 1986, New Zealand implemented an individual transferable quota system (ITQ) for selected inshore fish species to promote conservation of stocks and to improve the economic efficiency of the fishing industry. The primary feature of ITQs is the assignment of exclusive property rights for harvest of common-property resources. Individual transferable quotas define the limit of each fisherman's catch, in contrast to limited-entry schemes, which restrict inputs such as number of vessels. In theory, by providing each fisherman or company with rights to harvest a predefined portion of the sustainable catch, ITQs lead to both economic efficiency and resource conservation. The primary purposes of this study were to assess the perceived problems and benefits of an ITQ system and the initial effects of the ITQ system on individual businesses."
