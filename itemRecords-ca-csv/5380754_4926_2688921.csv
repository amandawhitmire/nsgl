8,Abstract:,"Design engineers are presented with a systematic approach and recommendations for planning and building docks and marinas resistant to winter ice damage. The author--relying on more than 10 years of field research, published information and design experience in Great Lakes harbors-​-​discusses various design criteria for piles, piers and docks subject to ice. In addition, he estimates ice forces and soil resistances and recommends materials and methods to mitigate ice problems."
