15,Abstract:,"Seafood is a nutrient-rich food that provides high quality protein, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and several important minerals and vitamins. Research over the last two decades have shown that seafood consumption is closely linked to health benefits such as improved coronary health in adults and improved cognitive development in infants and children. While health benefits greatly outweigh the risks for the general population, there is concern that contaminants in some species of fish may pose risks for some select populations. However, the problem of reduced seafood consumption, due to price, availability, or undue caution may be the greatest risk for populations throughout the U.S. and other countries. A consensus building conference was facilitated to conduct a one and a half-day workshop that brought together participants from the private sector, government, academia, and advocacy communities to discuss the challenges and opportunities of a risk-based approach to seafood safety, and the coordinated roles of government and industry in such a system. The workshop focused on the issues and implications of messaging efforts currently being used by these groups (i.e. seafood guide cards and other advisories), with the goal of making concrete and actionable recommendations for implementation of a new science-based message. The Framing the Message About Seafood conference represented the first time that a very diverse group of stakeholders have been convened to discuss the information that has been presented to the public on seafood health benefits and risks in a format designed to specifically explore and identify alternative approaches to reduce confusion and misinformation. It was remarkable that a consensus was reached on an alternative approach that could be readily translated to an existing Web-based resource that would be easy to use and could provide a model for others."
