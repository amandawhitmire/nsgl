14,Abstract:,"Lophotoxin is one member of a family of neurotoxins that can be isolated from gorgonian (soft) corals; these toxins bind selectively and irreversibly within the actylcholine-​recognition site of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, thereby preventing acetylcholine from activating the receptor. In addition to an unusual mechanism of action, the lophotoxin family of neurotoxins are unique nicotinic receptor antagonists in that they are devoid of nitrogen and thus do not contain a positive charge. Since they are relatively small and since their ring systems may provide conformational stability, a greater understanding of their site and mechanism of action may shed light on the 3-D topography of the amino acids comprising the acetylcholine-​recognition site. Structure/activ​ity studies were therefore undertaken to define further the structural features of the toxins that are involved in their chemical reactivity and biological activity."
