9,Abstract:,"Perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium) is an aggressive, non-native herbaceous weed displacing native vegetation in marshes, floodplains, prairies and rangeland throughout California. You can even find it growing along roadsides and highways. But does the plant's ubiquity really mean it is an ecological problem warranting costly eradication efforts? The project's goal was to address this question by quantifying some of the specific ways in which the weed affects plant, insect and invertebrate life, and by extension local food webs, at Rush Ranch Open Space Preserve in Suisun Marsh, part of the San Francisco Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve."
