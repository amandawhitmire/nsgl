15,Abstract:,"Predicted increases in wastewater flows from seven megacities by 2050 show that even with large capital investments in sewage treatment to treat an ever-increasing volume of wastewater, nitrogen loadings to coastal oceans will continue to increase dramatically. Furthermore, it is uncertain if nations will be able to afford the huge capital investments required to gain nitrogen reduction via tertiary or reverse osmosis treatments, or if these nitrogen reductions will be enough to fall below a threshold that would prevent the eutrophication of coastal waters. Carrying capacity models for use in coastal waters to guide the management of wastewater nutrient loadings are not widely available, making cost benefit analyses difficult, if not impossible. In order to avoid continuing damage to coastal ecosystems from increased wastewater nutrient loadings, future urban ecosystems must plan for: (i) diverting a greater percentage of wastewaters inland, and more aggressively developing water markets for wastewaters; (ii) increasing research investments into understanding the ecological roles and carrying capacities of wastewater inputs to protect (and even possibly enhance) nearshore ecosystems; and (ii) developing new, innovative urban ecosystems that make productive use of wastewaters for aquaculture and agriculture. A pilot scale aquaculture- wetland ecosystem (AWE) using wastewaters was developed in Los Angeles County California (USA) that grew luxuriant crops of Chinese water spinach and tilapia for food, and water hyacinths as soil conditioners (mulch and composts). The AWE removed over 97% of the nutrients from tertiary- treated wastewaters."
