16,Abstract:,"Spawning market squid lay embryo capsules on the seafloor of the continentalshel​f of the California Current System (CCS), where ocean acidification, deoxygenationan​d intensified upwelling lower the pH and [O2]. Squid statolith geochemistryhas been shown to reflect the squid’s environment (e.g., seawater temperature and elementalconcen​tration). We used real-world environmental levels of pH and [O2] observed onsquid-embryo beds to test in the laboratory whether or not squid statolith geochemistryref​lects environmental pH and [O2]. We asked whether pH and [O2] levels might affect theincorporatio​n of element ratios (B:Ca, Mg:Ca, Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca, Pb:Ca, U:Ca) into squidembryonic statoliths as (1) individual elements and/or (2) multivariate elemental signatures,and consider future applications as proxies for pH and [O2] exposure. Embryo exposure tohigh and low pH and [O2] alone and together during development over four weeks onlymoderately affected elemental concentrations of the statoliths, and uranium was an important element driving these differences. Uranium:Ca was eight-times higher instatoliths exposed to low pHT (7.57–7.58) and low [O2] (79–82 µmol·kg−1) than thoseexposed to higher ambient pHT (7.92–7.94) and [O2] (241–243 µmol·kg−1). In a separateexperim​ent, exposure to low pHT (7.55–7.56) or low [O2] (83–86 µmol·kg−1) yieldedelevated U:Ca and Sr:Ca in the low [O2] treatment only. We found capsular effects onmultiple elements in statoliths of all treatments. The multivariate elemental signatures ofembryonic statoliths were distinct among capsules, but did not reflect environmentalfa​ctors (pH and/or [O2]). We show that statoliths of squid embryos developing insidecapsules have the potential to reflect environmental pH and [O2], but that these “signals”are generated in concert with the physiological effects of the capsules and embryos themselves."
