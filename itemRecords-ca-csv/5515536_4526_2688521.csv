11,Abstract:,"DEPT and INEPT pulse sequences transfer the polarization of 1H nuclei to 13C nuclei in order to enhance the sensitivity of the 13C-nmr signal. Successful 13C signal enhancement using polarization transfer depends on various factors including the relaxation time of the 1H (sensitive) nuclei. The nuclear relaxation agent Gd(fod)3 is capable of selectively inducing nuclear relaxation of 1H nuclei to the point where they are no longer capable of transferring polarization to 13C nuclei. When this degree of nuclear relaxation is followed by observation of 13C nuclei using the DEPT or INEPT pulse sequences, 13C resonances, which are normally enhanced through polarization transfer, are nulled."
