10,Abstract:,"Long-term studies of the lower salt marsh of Tijuana Estuary in southern California have led to the low salinity gap hypothesis, which suggests that particular enironmental conditions favor either ""Spartina foliosa"" or ""Salicornia virginica"". Information from these studies was used in a model which (1) supported the low salinity gap hypothesis by accurately predicting elevational range of both ""Spartina"" and ""Salicornia""; (2) demonstated that the relative biomass of both species is sensitive to simulated flooding, reservoir release, drought, and estuary closure during the growing season, matching field observations; and (3) suggested techniques for endangered species habitat management and wetland restoration."
