16,Abstract:,pollution
17,,"Participants in a workshop reviewed the state of knowledge on the fate and impact of marine debris to determine the extent of the problem, recommend possible mitigating actions, and identify future research needs. Three sessions focused on the source and quantification of marine debris, the impacts of debris on resources, particularly the effects of entanglement; and the fate of such debris. The publication includes about 35 papers or other presentations."
