12,Abstract:,"Archaea, was thought to predominantly comprise microorganisms that inhabit extreme environments inhospitable to most Eucarya and Bacteria. However, molecular phylogenetic surveys of native microbial assemblages are beginning to indicate that the evolutionary and physiological diversity of Archaea are far greater than previously supposed. The authors report the discovery and preliminary characterizatioâ€‹n of a marine archaeon that inhabits the tissues of a temperate water sponge. The association was specific, with a single crenarchaeal phylotype inhabiting a single sponge host species. To the authors' knowledge, this partnership represents the first described symbiosis involving Crenarchaeota."
