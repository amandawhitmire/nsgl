13,Abstract:,"Delaware's coastal lagoons, known locally as ""inland"" bays, are experiencing the effects of chronic eutrophication and sediment erosion resultant from several decades of development and sustained nutrient input from within the surrounding watershed. This cumulative impact has degraded water quality and has reduced the diversity and abundance of various species of fishes, invertebrates and submerged aquatic vegetation. In 1994 the Delaware Legislature established the Delaware Center for the Inland Bays (CIB) to foster a program for stewardship of the estuary (Rehoboth, Indian River and Little Assawoman Bays) and its indigenous flora and fauna. To evaluate the rehabilitation potential for oyster populations, the Center in collaboration with the University of Delaware Sea Grant program established a pilot-scale artificial reef and twelve oyster gardening sites during the spring/summers of 2002/03. Positive community response along with support from Sussex County and local municipalities and a subsequent partnership with Delaware State University have facilitated a tenfold expansion of this community-based volunteer program during the last six years. The presentation reviews lessons learned from field deployment and performance results and discusses factors influencing the transition of the original stock enhancement strategy from seasonal bottom plantings of juvenile oysters to replenish the reef to a broader estuary-wide approach. This revised strategy takes fuller advantage of unique hydrographic conditions and the restrictive physical characteristics of residential lagoon communities to promote natural recruitment. It also improves living shoreline habitat by utilizing both floating gear and the three dimensional off-bottom structure of rip rap which is widely used in the estuary for shoreline stabilization and erosion control. Addition of a simple small-scale remote setting system utilizing larvae produced from disease resistant stocks has improved the quantity and quality of oyster stocks being deployed and has significantly improved oyster spat handling and transport."
