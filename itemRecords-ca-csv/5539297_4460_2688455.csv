13,Abstract:,"The discovery of new pharmaceuticals and other useful chemicals from marine resources is an exciting venture that has the ability to stimulate productivity in the commercial sector. However, the process of isolating, identifying, and commercially developing biologically active substances from marine resources is lengthy and costly. As a result, the close collaboration of university researchers, industry, and government is essential. Only such collaboration can ensure that research results will ultimately find commercial application, thereby stimulating economic growth in the pharmaceutical and other industrial sectors of our economy. The National Sea Grant College Program has had a long history of supporting research in marine pharmacology and natural product chemistry through several of the state Sea Grant Colleges. The success of these efforts has made it clear that a truly national strategic research initiative is essential if we are to ensure U.S. leadership in this vital field. The intent of this proposal by the Sea Grant Working Committee for the Development of Bio-Organic Chemistry and Pharmacology of Marine Resources is to stimulate development of such an initiative. As members of the Sea Grant Working Committee for the Development of Bio-Organic Chemistry and Pharmacology of Marine Resources, we believe that the United States must undertake a national strategic research initiative both to expand research and to develop the human resources necessary for our nation to maintain leadership in the field. In our proposal for a strategic research initiative, we have spelled out the special scientific focus that a U.S. initiative should adopt The underwater world is a unique source of new medicinal agents. And, for a number of reasons, the next decade is the time to exploit this resource through a strategic research initiative. While the yield of truly novel chemicals from traditional sources for today's drugs (terrestrial plants and microbial fermentations) has declined, the pioneering studies of marine natural products chemists have shown that almost every class of marine organism contains exciting new molecules. Pharmacologists​, physiologists, and biochemists have demonstrated that many of these marine natural products possess properties that modify fundamental life processes in ways that have important biomedical applications. These molecules are the leads that the pharmaceutical and chemical industries have begun to focus on as templates for development of the drugs of tomorrow."
