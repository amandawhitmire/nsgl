11,Abstract:,"While ballast water discharges are widely recognized as being a ?vector? for the spread of non-native species, boat hulls can also transport species from one area to another. These hitchhikers?cre​atures like barnacles, tunicates, algae and mussels?are often broadly referred to as fouling organisms, nuisance species that boat owners must periodically scrape off their hulls. These species, as biologists and resource managers are coming to appreciate, however, can be more than just pests. Many common fouling organisms are also nonnative species; some are ones wildlife officials are trying to contain. To help control the spread of exotics, the California Sea Grant Extension Program and California State Lands Commission have published the proceedings of a workshop, ?Managing Hull Transport of Aquatic Invasive Species,? held May 2005 in San Francisco and attended by boat owners, academics, resource managers, environmentalis​ts and representatives from the boating industry."
