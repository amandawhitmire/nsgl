14,Abstract:,"Decades ago researchers discovered that injected eyestalk extracts were able to elevate the blood glucose in crabs. The hormone responsible for this hyperglycemic effect has in the last 8 years been identified, and is commonly referred to as the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH). This paper reports the development of a sensitive ELISA for CHH, the use of the ELISA as a tool for the quantification of environmental stresses in lobsters, the characterizatioâ€‹n of a probe for the CHH gene(s), and its use in northern blot analyses."
