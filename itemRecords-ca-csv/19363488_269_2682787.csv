9,Abstract:,"While California commercial fisheries have been downsized over recent years, commercial fishing still provides a viable career for young people. Due to increased knowledge of the nutritional benefits of seafood, per capita fish consumption has reached 15kg/head/year and with the growing population this number will only increase (Valdimarsson, Grimur and James 2001). This is particularly true given the recent local food movement that is supporting the development of direct marketing of seafood products, with fishermen able to capture more of the value added to their catch. Value-added seafood has become an important driver in sustainability, marketing and sales and it has been a recent focus for many fisheries (Morrissey and DeWitt 2014). These current fishing and new marketing opportunities, however, are not well known and they require additional training as regulations have become more complex and selling one's product requires additional skills. Further, with the California commercial fleet aging – Santa Barbara Channel commercial fishermen in 2007 were on average 52 years old (Culver et al. 2007) – there is a need to recruit young, well-educated people into commercial fisheries to maintain this important California coastal heritage. California Sea Grant proposed to develop an apprenticeship program to help educate young people about the opportunities in commercial fishing, while educating them about the regulations, skills and co-management approach necessary to keep commercial fishing economically, ecologically and socially sustainable. Apprenticeship programs have been shown to be successful and effective when incorporated. Lerman’s key findings suggest that the apprentice’s contribution to production is significant enough to offset the costs of employment, thanks to give retention rate business benefit from low recruitment rates and training costs. Other benefits include knowing that all the apprentices have learned similar set of skills, which strengthens the industry by potentially setting very high standards (Lerman 2014). Another study focusing on apprenticeships in the United States revealed that employers participating in apprenticeship programs identify them as highly attractive and all (SOMe %?) expressed the desire to expand the program (to different fields? More regions? Or just make it bigger with more employers and apprentices in current places? (Lerman 2010)."
