9,Abstract:,"In this study a residual inhibitory effect of modified atmosphere (MA) storage was demonstrated for fish, and the resulting increase in shelf life was estimated. Results strongly suggested that decreased surface pH or residual CO2 at the fish surface was not the basis for this inhibitory effect. CO2 uptake and release during MA storage and during MA-to-air transfer, not measured in previous studies, were monitored. Finally, changes in the numbers and types of microorganisms present during the MA-to-air transfer were examined and provided a possible explanation of the residual inhibitory effect."
