12,Abstract:,"This paper addresses questions of community and patch stability as defined by the population biology of dominant plants in the context of different areas within a large kelp forest. (1) Do large-scale episodic events override biological mechanisms as major community structuring processes? (2) Are different local areas characterized by different processes? (3) How persistent are the patches of biological structure over decadal and local spatial scales? These questions are evaluated with regard to the effects of various types of disturbance for as much as three decades on the populations of several species of kelp in the large kelp forest off Point Loma, San Diego, California. The most sensitive population factors studied include recruitment, density, and survivorship. The population biology of ""Macrocystis"" was remarkably similar in most areas, as the cohort longevity and survivorship curves were very similar, and the plant and stipe densities tended to level off in only a few years. Thus large-scale episodic events such as El Ninos, La Ninas, and rare storms exert dramatic impacts, but small-scale responses such as density-vague recruitment (neither density dependent nor density independent) and survival allow prompt recovery, often to preexisting patterns."
