11,Abstract:,"Elkhorn Slough is one of the largest remaining salt marshes in California available to migratory shorebirds using the Pacific Flyway. Objectives in this study were to describe the seasonal patterns in species composition and abundance of shorebirds in Elkhorn Slough, and to identify components of the ecosystem that support this assemblage. Use of habitat (intertidal mudflats, salt pond, and salt marsh) and feeding ecology of selected species were assessed. Since 1983, more than 130 ha of diked wetlands have been returned to tidal action; salt ponds adjacent to the slough were exposed to tidal action in 1984. The present study, therefore, provides baseline information necessary for long-term monitoring of shorebirds in these newly restored marsh habitats."
