11,Abstract:,"In this study the authors used lobsters as an invertebrate model for the study of GABA A receptor modulator effects. Adult and juvenile male and female lobsters, ""Homarus americanus,"" were treated with single (or follow-up) empirically determined doses of the agonist diazepam, one of its metabolites (desmethyldiaze​pam), the antagonist N- methyl-​beta-​carboline-​3-​carboxamide (MBC), or vehicle alone. The effects of the compounds were monitored for differences in locomotor activity, which was significantly inhibited by diazepam. Treatment with MBC following injection of diazepam reversed the latter's effects on locomotion. These results suggest that benzodiazepines may affect crustacean GABA receptors in a fashion similar to the GABAA type found in the vertebrates, and that they may be involved in the regulation of locomotor behavior."
