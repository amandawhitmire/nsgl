14,Abstract:,"The marine sponge ""Tethya aurantia"" produces copious silica spicules, each of which contains a central axial filament of protein consisting of three very similar subunits named silicateins. At neutral pH, the silicatein filaments and their constituent subunits catalyze the ""in vitro"" polymerization of silica and silsesquioxanes from tetraethoxysilaâ€‹ne and organically modified silicon triethoxides, respectively. These findings, as well as the high structural similarity between the most abundant of the silicatein subunits and a cathepsin L, a protease that also functions as a general acid-base catalyst at neutral pH, suggest a possible mechanism for the ""in vitro"" reactions observed."
