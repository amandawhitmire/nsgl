7,Abstract:,"As part of the AdaptLA project led by USC Sea Grant, these coastal hazard modeling results were developed to help communities identify vulnerabilities and support planning decisions for impacts associated with sea level rise, storm surge, and coastal flooding. Models account for local conditions and project impacts which are downscaled to the regional and local level. Results may be used to support updates to local coastal land use plans, hazard mitigation plans, general plans, climate action and adaptation plans, and other related adaptation or implementation projects. This fact sheet has descriptions of the models and links to access results."
