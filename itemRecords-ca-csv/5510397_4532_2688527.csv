10,Abstract:,"Ecdysteroids (arthropod molting hormones) induce dramatic physiological changes in crustaceans prior to molting. Increases in ecdysteroid titers are correlated with extensive metabolic and morphological modifications which include increased water uptake, growth of epithelia, and degeneration of claw muscle. In-vitro studies on the effects of ecdysteroids on crustaceans have been limited to organ cultures of a few days or less. This paper presents techniques for the maintenance in culture for several months of isolated crustacean cells. In addition, it provides further evidence for the direct effect of ecdysteroids on crustacean cells in primary cell cultures of ""Homarus americanus"" and ""Pacifasticus leniusculus"" testicular and hematopoietic tissues."
