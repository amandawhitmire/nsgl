10,Abstract:,"Oxygen consumption rates were measured in 14 species of hydromedusae and 5 species of bathypelagic coronate scyphomedusae. Analysis of all individuals of all species of medusae showed the familiar pattern of decreasing specific oxygen consumption rate with increasing wet weight of animals. For pelagic medusae, there is no apparent decline in metabolic rate and metabolic potential, as determined by enzymatic activity, with increasing depth of occurrence, beyond the declines caused by the decrease in temperature with depth. These patterns are in contrast to the rapid declines in metabolic rates and metabolic potentials with depth that have been observed for pelagic fishes and crustaceans. Deep-living medusae have metabolic rates of a magnitude similar to those of bathypelagic fishes and crustaceans."
