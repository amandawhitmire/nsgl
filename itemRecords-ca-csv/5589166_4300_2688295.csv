10,Abstract:,"The Pacific Fishery Management Council has sharply restricted the ocean sportfishing and commercial salmon seasons in the Klamath Management Zone (KMZ) since 1985. Eventually these restrictions closed the salmon season for the entire month of August. Ports within the KMZ (Eureka, Trinidad, Crescent city, Brookings, Gold Beach, and Port Orford) were concerned about the effects these closures and restrictions might have on sport fishermen frequenting the area each summer. An ocean salmon sport fishermen survey questionnaire was distributed to salmon sport fishermen throughout each port in the KMZ ports better identify the 1991 season. The purpose of the survey was to help KMZ ports better identify the ocean salmon sportfish users and to obtain anglers opinions about present management techniques and regulations in the KMZ. Results are reported here."
