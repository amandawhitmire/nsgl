12,Abstract:,"Formation of ocular cataracts after seawater (SW) exposure of yearling coho salmon has been studied in relation to the parr-smolt transformation. No ocular opacity was observed in fish in fresh water (FW). In February and March, survival rates 12 h after exposure to SW were 20%, and cataracts were observed in all survivors. In April, when yearling coho smolts migrate naturally to the sea, the incidence of cataracts decreased to 40% in the first week, none in the second and third weeks, and 14% in the last week of the month. The increase in cataract formation coincided with a decrease in SW adaptability. The occurrence of cataracts after SW transfer may provide a simple and accurate method of evaluating the degree of smoltification of salmonids."
