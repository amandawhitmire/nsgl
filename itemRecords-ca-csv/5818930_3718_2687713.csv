12,Abstract:,"In this paper, the variability in the vertical position of a sewage plume, far from its point of discharge, is described and explained by the forcing from an internal tide. The sewage plume, discharged in the coastal waters of Mamala Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, was mapped using ship-board towyo observations. Horizontal currents and temperature were measured at moorings located throughout Mamala Bay. Data at a mooring located close to the diffuser suggested that the presence of an internal tide was responsible for large (more than half the total depth) semi-diurnal vertical displacements of the isotherms. This and other findings challenge the classical view of a sewage plume 'established' at a constant depth of equilibrium and are the first examples showing the effects of internal tides on sewage plumes."
