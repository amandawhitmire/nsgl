16,Abstract:,"Employing a co-culture screening approach that aims to replicate in-situ physical and biological conditions, we have explored the secondary metabolic potential of microbial communities inhabiting deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Co-culture of Roseovarius sp. LP5CB (alphaproteobac​teria) with Pseudoalteromon​as sp. LP5CW (gammaproteobac​teria), isolated from the Vai Lilli vent site in NE Lau Basin, resulted in the induction of a black pigment in significant quantities. While the pigment exhibited no cytotoxic activity, subsequent investigation of the culture extract led to the isolation of a metabolite with potent and selective activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Further analysis showed that this metabolite is constitutively produced by Pseudoalteromon​as sp. LP5CW under ideal monoculture conditions. Detailed analysis of LC-ESI-MS as well as 1- and 2D NMR spectroscopic data allowed characterizatio​n of the cytotoxic component. Optimization of culture conditions is underway to increase production of the active compound for evaluation of its cytotoxicity and mechanism of action against a panel of N. gonorrhoeae clinical isolates."
