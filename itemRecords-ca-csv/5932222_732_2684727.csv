13,Abstract:,"In this study, a three-tiered approach is used to identify human and nonhuman sources of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in Avalon Bay, a popular resort community on Catalina Island in southern California. The first and second tiers utlize standard FIB tests to spatially isolate the FIB signal, to characterize the variability of FIB over a range of temporal scales, and to measure FIB concentrations in potential sources of these organisms. In the third tier, water samples from FIB 'hot spots' and sources are tested for human-specific bacteria ""Bacteroides/Pr​evotella"" and enterovirus to determine whether the FIB are from human sewage or from nonhuman sources such as bird feces. FIB in Avalon Bay appear to be from multiple, primarily land- based, sources including bird droppings, contaminated subsurface water, leaking drains, and runoff from street wash-down activities. At least a portion of the FIB contamination is from human sewage."
