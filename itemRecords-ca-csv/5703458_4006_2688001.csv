11,Abstract:,"Sponges of the genus ""Dysidea"" are renowned for the diversity of their natural products. Some of the metabolites found in ""Dysidea"" spp. are located in symbiotic cyanobacteria and are almost certainly produced by the microorganisms. Sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and polyhydroxylate​d C-​""seco""-​sterols are considered to be the most representative metabolites of ""Dysidea species. The isolation of R-dysidazirine from ""Dysidea fragilis"" from Fiji was therefore unexpected. Researchers now report the isolation of both the (Z) and (E) geometrical isomers of S- dysidazirine and the (Z) and (E) isomers of a brominated analogue, S-antazirine."
