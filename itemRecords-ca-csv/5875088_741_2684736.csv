14,Abstract:,"Ten papers comprise these proceedings of a conference held in Anchorage in 1999 to organize a regional effort for research and monitoring of harmful algal blooms (HABs), a pervasive economic and health problem on the North American west coast. Subjects ranged from specific genera such as ""Alexandrium"" and ""Pseudo-​nitzschia,"" to the role of the FDA and the Alaska Science and Technology foundation, to regional HAB histories of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and California. Other topics covered were specific toxins, economic impacts, and diagnostic kits. Some audience comments are included."
