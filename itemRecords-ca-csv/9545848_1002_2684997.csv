18,Abstract:,"Mass mortality events are ephemeral phenomena in marine ecosystems resultingfrom anthropogenically enhanced and natural processes. A fish kill in King Harbor, RedondoBeach, California, USA, in March 2011 killed ~1.54 × 105 kg of fish and garnered internationalattention as a marine system out of balance. Here, we present data collected prior to, during, andfollowing the event that describe the oceanographic conditions preceding the event, spatial extentof hypoxia (dissolved oxygen <1.4 ml l−1), and subsequent recovery of the harbor. In situ sensorswithin the harbor revealed rapid decreases in dissolved oxygen in surface waters from 7 to9 March 2011, coincident with the mortality event on 8 March. Continuous observations providedevidence that respiration of a large population of fish within the harbor, potentially exacerbatedby an incursion of upwelled low-oxygen water, resulted in significant oxygen reduction in the harborand ultimately caused mortality of the fish population. The hydrodynamically constrainednorthern basin transitioned to nearly anoxic conditions, while spatially variable hypoxia wasobserved throughout the harbor and adjacent bay for>10 d following the event. Initial recovery ofdissolved oxygen in the harbor was facilitated by storm-mediated mixing. No connection wasapparent between increased algal biomass or phycotoxins within the harbor and the mortalityevent, although the fish showed evidence of prior exposure to the algal neurotoxin domoic acid.Our findings underscore the essential role of ocean observing and rapid response in the study ofthese events and the role that oceanographic processes play in hypoxia-driven fish mortalities.Alterations in upwelling regimes as a consequence of climate change are likely to further increasethe frequency and magnitude of upwelling-driven hypoxia and mortality events."
