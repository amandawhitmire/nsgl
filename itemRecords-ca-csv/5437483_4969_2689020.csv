12,Abstract:,"This is a report to the Resources Agency Sea Grant Advisory Panel. Sea Grant is a statewide, multiuniversity program of marine research, education, and advisory services. Sea Grant-sponsored research contributes to the growing body of knowledge about our coastal and ocean resources and, consequently, to the solution of many marine-related problems facing our nation. Through its Marine Advisory Services, Sea Grant transfers information and technology developed in research efforts to a wide community of interested parties and actual users of marine information in California and throughout the nation. Sea Grant also supports a broad range of educational programs for university students, public school teachers and students, and the general public so that our coastal and ocean resources can be understood and used judiciously by this and future generations."
