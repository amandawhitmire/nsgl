10,Abstract:,"In January, 2001 the governor of California was forced to declare a Stage 2 (power) Emergency and initiate the first blackouts since World War II. California were at critical levels. On April 10, 2003, the Los Angeles Times website listed its 10 major stories addresssing California energy problems since July 12, 2002. A January 29 story reports from a hearing at the state legislature, ""Californians pay an extra $3 billion a year for electricity since a failed attempt at deregulation [1998], and power supplies can run short again in 2007 and beyond."" None of the 10 stories indicate that a plan is emerging to solve the immediate crisis, let alone taking a serious look at California's energy future."
