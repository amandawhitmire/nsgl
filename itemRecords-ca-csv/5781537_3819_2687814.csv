11,Abstract:,"For this paper, an ELISA was developed for the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) from the lobster, ""Homarus americanus"". It is sensitive to as little as 0.2 fmol of peptide. The assay demonstrated increased CHH in the hemolymph of intact lobsters following emersion, exposure to high temperatures, and salinity stress. During emersion, concentrations of hemolymph glucose increased concomitantly with increases in CHH. Significant levels of hemolymph CHH were measured in lobsters that had been eyestalk-â€‹ablated. These observations indicate that there may be a source of CHH other than the X-organ/sinus gland in the lobster."
