10,Abstract:,"Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) involve the allocation of a share of the total allowable catch (TAC) to individual operators. The ITQs can be a fixed quantity or a percentage of a variable TAC and can be allocated for specified time periods or allocated in perpetuity. In theory, ITQs end the race for fish and lead to economically rational fishing exploitation. The purpose of this paper is to assess individual quotas as a fisheries management device based on the New Zealand experience with ITQs. The brief New Zealnd ITQ experience demonstrates that the economic rationale behind individual transferable quotas is sound. Individual transferable quotas should not be viewed as a panacea, but simply as another fisheries management option."
