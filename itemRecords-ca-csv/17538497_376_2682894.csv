18,Abstract:,"We investigated the hypothesis that synchronousrecr​uitment is due to a shared susceptibility to environmentalpr​ocesses using stock–recruitme​nt residualsfor 52 marine fish stocks within three Northeast Pacificlarge marine ecosystems: the Eastern Bering Sea andAleutian Islands, Gulf of Alaska, and California Current.There was moderate coherence in exceptionallyst​rong and weak year-classes and correlations acrossstocks. Based on evidence of synchrony from theseanalyses, we used Bayesian hierarchical models torelate recruitment to environmental covariates forgroups of stocks that may be similarly influenced byenvironmental processes based on their life histories.There were consistent relationships among stocks tothe covariates, especially within the Gulf of Alaskaand California Current. The best Gulf of Alaska modelincluded Northeast Pacific sea surface height as a predictorof recruitment, and was particularly strong forstocks dependent on cross-shelf transport during thelarval phase for recruitment. In the California Currentthe best-fit model included San Francisco coastal sealevel height as a predictor, with higher recruitment formany stocks corresponding to anomalously high sealevel the year before spawning and low sea level theyear of spawning. The best Eastern Bering Sea andAleutian Islands model included several environmentalva​riables as covariates and there was some consistentrespo​nse across stocks to these variables. Futureresearch may be able to utilize these across-stock environmentalin​fluences, in conjunction with an understandingof ecological processes important across earlylife history stages, to improve identification of environmentaldr​ivers of recruitment."
