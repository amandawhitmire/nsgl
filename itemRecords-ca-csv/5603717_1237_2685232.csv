11,Abstract:,"A composite time series of Pacific sardine and northern anchovy fish-​scale-​deposition rates has been developed from the anaerobic varved sediments of the Santa Barbara Basin off southern California. Spectral analysis of the scale-​deposition series shows that sardines and anchovies both tend to vary over a period of @ 60 years. In addition, the anchovies fluctuate at a period of 100 years. The anchovy and sardine series show a moderate correlation over long time scales of several centuries or more; the correlation of shorter-period components in the time series is virtually nil. The scale-​deposition record shows nine major recoveries and subsequent collapses of the sardine population over 1700 years. The average time for a recovery of the sardine is 30 years."
