16,Abstract:,"Species traits that carry adaptive advantage such as reproductive timing and stress resilience may differ among reproductively discrete locales. Knowledge and consideration of these traits should, therefore, be integrated into conservation efforts that include long-term persistence of species. To test for adaptive differences between Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, populations a reciprocal transplant experiment was carried out monitoring survival, growth, and reproduction using three established populations of O. lurida within Puget Sound, Washington. Performance differed for each population. O. lurida from Dabob Bay had higher survival at all sites but lower reproductive activity and growth. Oysters from Oyster Bay demonstrated greater proportion of brooding females at a majority of sites with moderate growth and survival. Together these data suggest the existence of O. lurida population structure within Puget Sound and provide information on how broodstock should be selected for restoration purposes."
17,,"Where restoration efforts occur, such as with Ostrea lurida in Puget Sound, Washington, it is important to consider genetic population structure. Traits that hold adaptive advantage such as reproductive timing and stress resilience may differ at local scales. Using three established populations of O.lurida within Puget Sound, Washington, a reciprocal transplant experiment was performed and survival, growth, reproduction was monitored. Results showed that performance differed for each population at each of these three metrics. Ostrea lurida from a relatively harsh home site environment with low primary production and high dynamic habitats exhibited generally greater survival at all sites, whereas those from a relatively lush home site environment with high primary production and lower habitat dynamics exhibited generally greater reproductive activity at all sites. Populations from sites with shorter growing seasons exhibited greater growth in sites with longer growing periods, suggesting a countergradient​ adaptation may have occurred in these populations."
