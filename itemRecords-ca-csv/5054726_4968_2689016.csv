13,Abstract:,"This is an annual report on the University of California Sea Grant College Program for September 1, 1976 to August 31, 1977 The California Sea Grant College Program is administered by the statewide University of California Institute of Marine Resources.Â Sea Grant is a pioneering effort involving state, regional, and local interests directly in the formulation of federal research and development priorities and the conduct of the resulting programs. The strong partnership developed among the state's universities, industry, the state of California, and the federal government, each of whom directly funds the program, is working. Our experience can be a model for national and international endeavors to tap the intellectual potential and developmental expertise residing in industry, Academia and Government to meet contemporary ocean and coastal needs."
