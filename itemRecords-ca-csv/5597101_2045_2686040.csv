13,Abstract:,"Smoltification involves a number of morphological, physiological and behavioral changes which prepare the young fish for a pelagic existence prior to leaving the freshwater (FW) habitat. In the estuary the fish may theoretically choose between returning up the FW stream or entering the sea. This choice may be dependent on the degree of hypoosmoregulat​ory ability of the fish. The salinity preference test is a behavioral study to determine the extent of development of this hypoosmoregulat​ory ability based on physiological readiness and behavioral motivation. Growth hormones from mammals, tilapia and chum salmon enhance survival and reduce plasma Na+ elevation of some salmonids after transfer from FW to seawater. Elevation of blood thyroxine level is observed during the smoltification period. Cortisol also stimulates hypoosmoregulat​ory mechanisms in fish. Inasmuch as smoltification and seaward migration of salmonids appear to be under the influence of these hormones, their effects on salinity preference of underyearling coho salmon were examined in this study."
