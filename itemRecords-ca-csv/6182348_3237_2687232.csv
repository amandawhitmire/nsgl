10,Abstract:,"The main objective of this project was to estimate the value added to fish landed in Moss Landing, Monterey and Santa Cruz harbors in 2003, as the fish moved from fishermen to processors, packagers, distributors and seafood retailers. Another primary goal was to document the ""spatial distribution"" of fishing activity in the region- where marine species were landed, processed, packaged and sold, at what prices and to whom during the six-year period from 1998 to 2003. These calculations were based on commercial fishing data, fish processors' expenditures and revenues, and local retail seafood prices. Processors were also interviewed about the history of their businesses, locations of facilities, numbers of employees, top customers, and sources of goods and services. Harbormasters were another source of information on commercial fishing and processing activities at their respective harbors. The cumulative results of these quantitative and qualitative investigations provide some insights into the economic value and diversity of fishing operations in Monterey Bay. This information will help policymakers assess the consequences of resource management."
