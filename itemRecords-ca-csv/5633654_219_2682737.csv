9,Abstract:,"Young people are naturally attracted to the sea, and early on may fantasize about a Cousteau-like career in oceanography. For those who are serious enough to pursue the years of needed study, California's public and private institutions of higher learning offer the finest and most diverse courses of preparation available anywhere. Students come from all over the world to study plate tectonics at Stanford; fisheries at Humboldt State University; naval architecture at the University of California, Berkeley; marine pharmacology at the University of California, Santa Barbara; or sonar systems at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. But even those students who don't go on to graduate education can prepare for a variety of marine-related careers at California colleges, ranging from underwater photographer or recreational diving specialist to marine transportation manager. This completely updated directory describes marine programs at 48 two- and four-year schools of higher learning in California. It is an invaluable guide not only to teachers and counselors, but also to students who may not be aware of the full breadth of opportunities in the field."
