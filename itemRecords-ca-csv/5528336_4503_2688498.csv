9,Abstract:,"Marine bacteria can cause glowing or luminescence when they grow on seafood products; most luminous bacteria can grow at temperatures as low as 39 deg. F, but they require sodium or salt to multiply. When seafood glows it means that many luminous bacteria are present, but it does not mean the seafood is unsafe or of poor quality. This fact sheet describes the phenomenon."
