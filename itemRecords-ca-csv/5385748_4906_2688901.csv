10,Abstract:,"Terminology commonly used in age determination studies has recently been carefully defined and the procedures necessary to adequately verify the temporal nature of band deposition in the calcified structures of fishes outlined. This paper (1) provides an overview of the techniques which have been used in age determinations of elasmobranchs; (2) reviews the approaches used to verify these age determinations, including new information from electron microprobe analyses and results from radiometric dating techniques; and (3) suggests other directions that researchers studying the age and growth of elasmobranchs might fruitfully take in the future to elucidate these processes (the physiological aspects of calcium dynamics and the role of the endocrine system in calcium regulation are two such directions)."
