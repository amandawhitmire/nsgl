10,Abstract:,"Visible and infrared data from the Visible Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR) aboard the Geostationary Earth Observing Satellites (GOES) meteorological satellites have been used increasingly in quantitative, environmental applications. For a quantitative utilization of VISSR visible data, it is important to assess previous calibration work, understand whether observed calibration changes are linked to instrument behavior or have other origins (e.g., normalization procedure, difference among detectors), and devise a strategy for operational radiometric calibration of VISSR visible imagery. This article reports on the development and testing of operational algorithms for the in-flight calibration of the VISSR visible sensor. The GOES- 7 VISSR solar channels are radiometrically calibrated for the period from June 1987 through November 1988. Space, White Sands, and the Somora Desert are used as calibration targets."
