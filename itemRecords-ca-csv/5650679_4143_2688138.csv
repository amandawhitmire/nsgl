10,Abstract:,"Larvae of the abalone ""Haliotis rufescens"" lack a digestive system and have been considered to be 'non-feeding' (lecithotrophicâ€‹) throughout their lifespan. This review summarizes recent research illustrating that larval stages of abalone can 'feed' by utilizing organic carbon that is in solution in natural seawater. For the larval cultures studied, the rates of utilization of endogenous biochemical reserves did not supply the energy needs of the larvae. Dissolved organic material in seawater could supply the missing energy not supplied by the egg. These findings suggest that alterations to the organic chemistry of seawater can affect the metabolism of larvae. If such alterations are not controlled for in aquaculture facilities, the presence or absence of dissolved organic compounds in seawater can alter the growth and development of abalone."
