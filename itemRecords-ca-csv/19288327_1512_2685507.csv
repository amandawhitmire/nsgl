11,Abstract:,"This is the story of the totoaba Totoaba macdonaldi, an iconic and highly valuable fish from the Sea of Cortez (also known as the Gulf of California) in Mexico. Overfished to commercial depletion in the first half of the twentieth century, the species is currently listed as critically endangered and it continues to be threatened by illegal fishing, habitat degradation, and insufficient enforcement of fishing and environmental regulations. Few fish are as interesting as the totoaba from the standpoints of biology, conservation, sociology, and regulation. Now aquaculture has the potential to bring totoaba back as a sustainable resource and to generate prosperity in an economically-â€‹depressed region of Mexico."
