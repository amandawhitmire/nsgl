10,Abstract:,"A new nucleic acid stain, SYBR Green I, can be used for the rapid and acccurate determination of viral and bacterial abundances in diverse marine samples. The authors tested this stain with formalin-â€‹preserved samples of coastal water and also from depth profiles (to 800 m) from sites 19 and 190 km offshore, by filtering a few ml onto 0.02 micrometer pore-size filters and staining for 15 min. Comparison of bacterial counts to those made with acridin orange and virus counts with those made by transmission electron microscopy showed very strong correlations. SYBR Green I stained samples need no desalting or heating, and counts can be easily performed at sea immediately after sampling."
