13,Abstract:,"As marine finfish aquaculture expands, there is an increasing interest in the ability to ship early life stages from breeding centers to hatcheries. Here we conducted a 24 h air shipping simulation with eggs of white seabass (WSB; Atractoscion nobilis). We examined the effects of a pH buffer on water quality, post-shipping egg survival, and subsequent hatchingsuccess​, at egg densities of 1000, 5000, 10,000, and 15,000 eggs/L. The pH buffer, 8.3 Trizma®, was tested at varying concentrations of zero (NT=0.00 g/L), low (LT=0.75 g/L), medium (MT=1.5 g/L) and high(HT=3.0 g/L). Shipping densities up to 5000 eggs/L consistently yielded>70% survival immediately aftersimulated shipment, hatching success>70%, and>45% survival 48 h after the simulations, when Trizmaconcentra​tions were under 1.5 g/L. At those densities, pH was maintained at ~8.0 when buffered at a minimum Trizma level of 0.75 g/L. The highest densities of 10,000 and 15,000 eggs/L yielded lower survival 0–6% after 24 h, regardless of pH buffer concentration. Based on the results from these air-shipping simulations, we recommend WSB eggs be shipped in seawater with a maximum of 0.75 g/L Trizma® at densities no>5000 eggs/L. We believe this represents an important step in improving long distance transport protocols and provides useful guidance in air transport of othereconomical​ly and ecologically important marine species."
