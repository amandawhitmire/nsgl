12,Abstract:,"This project aimed to identify key drivers in the resistance for reconciling expert opinion, stakeholder interests, and landowner priorities. In doing so, this study explored the broad range of discourses on flood risk and flood management in the region.By providing an understanding of the reasons behind the flood risk perceptions of stakeholders using a socio-cultural framework of risk perception, this research will increase the understanding of how social values motivate the measures supported for adaptation to climate change. In particular, this study explored the social acceptability of alternatives to the current levee system."
