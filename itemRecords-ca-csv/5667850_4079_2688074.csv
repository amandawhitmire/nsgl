10,Abstract:,"Eggs and early naupliar stages of copepods, and possibly other metazoan eggs, could be important prey items for ""Protoperidiniu​m"" cf. ""divergens"", which is prey for adult copepods. This study provides a basis for understanding the interactions and a path of recycling carbon between the populations of ""Protoperidiniu​m"" spp. and copepods, often among the most abundant micro- and macrozooplankto​n."
