8,Abstract:,"The objective of ""Total quality management"" (TQM) is to improve quality and productivity, drive down costs, and improve profits. TQM systems require management commitment; they encourage employee participation in all phases of quality improvement. ""Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point"" (HACCP) system is a simple and effective way to ensure food safety. It allows you to predict potential risks to food safety and to prevent them before they happen. By using the HACCP approach to food safety, you will no longer have to rely solely on routine inspections to spot and control potential food safety hazards."
