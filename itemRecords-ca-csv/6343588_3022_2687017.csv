10,Abstract:,"New government policies and initiatives will likely advance aquaculture in the United States. The Department of Commerce and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration policies are intended to facilitate sustainable marine aquaculture, restore natural resources and enhance fisheries. Additional initiatives address shellfish production, aquaculture management in the Gulf of Mexico and technology transfer. Collectively, they will also educate the public about aquaculture, break down regulatory hurdles and advance the science of sustainable aquaculture."
