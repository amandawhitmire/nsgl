17,Abstract:,"The Santa Barbara Area Coastal Ecosystem Vulnerability Assessment (SBA CEVA) is a multidisciplina​ry research project that investigates future changes to southern Santa Barbara County climate, beaches, watersheds, wetland habitats and beach ecosystems. The target audience is local land use planners and decision makers. The main objective is to provide information that assists the Cities of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, and Goleta, the County of Santa Barbara, and UC Santa Barbara in climate adaptation planning with a clear focus on coastal ecosystems. Led by California Sea Grant, SBA CEVA was developed from the work of three of the state's leading ecological and climatological research programs: UCSB's Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program, the UCSD Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and their activities within the California and Nevada Applications Program regional Integrated Science and Assessment (CNAP RISA), the California 4th Climate Assessment and the Southwest Climate Science Center Program, and USGS Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS)."
