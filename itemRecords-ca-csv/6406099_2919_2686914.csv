19,Abstract:,"Molluscan resources are an often overlooked in aquaculture, fisheries and biodiversity conservation. Molluscan resources are threatened by habitat degradation, IUFF fishing (illegal, unreported and unregulated) and gaps in policy and regulation. At the same time, their potential for aquaculture development is high, given that they require fewer inputs than many other species and have lower technology requirements. Molluscan aquaculture in Latin America is disproportionat​ely low in comparison to its potential. In part this is due to a wide-spread preference for investment and research related to shrimp culture due to its profitability. As shrimp culture continues to encounter disease, economic and environmental issues, the drive to diversify aquaculture has brought increased attention to the potential of molluscan aquaculture. Bivalves in particular are increasingly of interest in recognition of the ecological services they provide, and threats to their existence due to impacts related to global climate change such as ocean acidification. Integrated and long-term approaches are necessary to improve molluscan fisheries management and at the same time increase benefits accruing to poor coastal communities by developing molluscan aquaculture. Community awareness raising and involvement are a key part of implementing successful solutions to these problems. Environmental issues may also pose an obstacle, particularly with respect to shellfish sanitation- an issue linked to community sanitation and public health. Improving bivalve sanitation must accompany such efforts. The Aquaculture and Fisheries Collaborative Research Support Program (AquaFish CRSP) and the Sustainable Coastal Communities and Ecosystems Program (SUCCESS), both funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), have made improving molluscan fisheries, development of aquaculture appropriate for coastal communities, and shellfish sanitation priorities for their global work programs. On the Pacific Coasts of Mexico and Nicaragua, considerable success has been encountered with developing molluscan aquaculture in a manner suitable for resource-poor coastal community groups, establishing shellfish sanitation programs and establishing no-take zones for bivalves that are supported and controlled by the community. These efforts utilize simple methodologies that can be adopted in other areas, but require a long-term commitment on the part of the donors and technical assistant providers (3-5 years minimum). Additionally, all stakeholders including the community, private sector, government agencies and non-profit organizations must be fully involved in order for these efforts to be sustainable. Coupling on-the-ground activities with development of appropriate policies, regulation and enforcement is also required."
