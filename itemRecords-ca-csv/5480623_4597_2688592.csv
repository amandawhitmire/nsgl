8,Abstract:,"Successful wetlands restoration means replacement of lost functional values. Included are water quality improvement, hydrologic benefits, food chain support, and long-term persistence. A specific wetland type performs some or all of these functions, but in a unique way. Restoring wetland functions requires a lot more than planting a few species that happen to be available from nurseries or nearby borrow sites. It means creating an opportunity for ecosystem development. Instead of creating persistent, self-​maintaining wetlands, we often create technological fixes-​-​artificial systems whose basic hydrology must be manipulated by levees, tide control structures, irrigation pipes or other technological advances. To improve our chances of success and to reduce the risk of irretrievable loss in functional values and regional biodiversity requires long-term monitoring in conjunction with research to identify cause/effect relationships-​-​so we not only know what happens but why it happens."
