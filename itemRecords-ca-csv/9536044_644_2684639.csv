7,Abstract:,"Marine predators forage in a heterogeneous landscape where prey patches are unevenly distributed. Predators return to larger scale areas of consistent productivity such as the California Current, and search at finer temporal and spatial scales to locate prey patches. One of the most abundant avian marine predators in the California Current is the sooty shearwater. Sooty shearwaters leave southern hemisphere islands at the end of the breeding season in the southern autumn. They arrive in the California Current after completing a trans-​hemispheric migration, in need of replenishing body condition. Sooty shearwaters are adapted for efficient flight, and their flight is highly correlated with winds. Shearwaters in this study appeared to use winds opportunistical​ly, and responded by vacating foraging hotspots following a reversal in winds, often flying more economically in a downwind direction. Shearwaters also used headwind and tailwind flight much more frequently than expected. This was a result of constraints of a north-south oriented coastline, and available winds. Sooty shearwaters travelled synchronously while foraging in the CC and when departing on the southern migration. The cue to depart on the southern migration was likely a combination of factors of phenology, local enhancement and body condition."
