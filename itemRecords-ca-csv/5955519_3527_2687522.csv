9,Abstract:,"Excessive levels of dissolved copper in some harbors are due in part to slow leaching from anti-fouling paint on boat bottoms. Because elevated copper levels threaten marine life and birds, and because regulations require compliance with water quality standards, some areas are advocating the use of nontoxic anti-fouling bottom coatings that are affordable, effective and durable. There are many products on the market that exert significantly less environmental impact (wax; ceramic-epoxy; fiber-epoxy; silicone; siloxane; water-based urethane), and scientists believe that better solutions are on the way. The purpose of this report is to provide information on reducing pollution from toxic bottom coatings to those who own or repair boats; manage marinas, yacht clubs, harbors, or ports; supply paints or coatings; or oversee environmental policies. Much of it is based on research conducted in 2002 in the San Diego Bay area. The authors present performance, maintenance, and economic comparisons of copper-based and nontoxic bottom coatings, and provide practical advice on how to choose cost-effective nontoxic alternatives. They also review a survey of boaters' concerns regarding bottom coatings."
