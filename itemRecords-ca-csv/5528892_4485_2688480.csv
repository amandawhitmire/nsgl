14,Abstract:,"Sea whips of the genus ""Pseudopterogor​gia"" are among the most chemically prolific of the octocorals in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Researchers earlier encountered a new class of potent antiinflammator​y agents, the pseudopterosins (and seco-​pseudopterosins​), which are diterpene glycosides from ""P. elisabethae."" Described here are eight new diterpene glycosides, pseudopterosins E-L, along with the methylated aglycon from pseudopterosin E, isolated from the organic extracts of two collections of ""P. elisabethae."" The new pseudopterosins are superior antiinflammator​y agents in comparison to pseudopterosin A. Pseudopterosin E shows very low acute toxicity in mice (unlike A-D) and appears to act by a novel mechanism of pharmacological action."
