12,Abstract:,"Seawater transfer of Atlantic salmon (""Salmo salar"") in an early stage of smoltification caused cessation of growth, loss of appetite and eventual death. The fish had high plasma growth hormone levels and decreased plasma thyroxine levels indicating that this abnormal development is similar to stunting of coho salmon following premature transfer. However, the Atlantic salmon also showed severe impairment of hypoosmoregulatâ€‹ory ability, not observed in coho stunts. Atlantic salmon stunts transferred back into fresh water resumed feeding and growth, indicating that stunting is a reversible process caused by exposure of fish to high environmental salinity at an inappropriate stage of development."
