9,Abstract:,"Radiolabeled free amino acids (FAA) are taken up rapidly from dilute solution in seawater by soft-bodied marine invertebrates. The present paper reports rapid translocation and distribution of FAA to deeper tissues after uptake by the Pacific oyster, ""Crassostrea gigas"". A technique for inducing and sustaining steady rates of water transport through the mantle cavity of oysters is also reported."
