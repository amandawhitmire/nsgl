10,Abstract:,"The authors previously proposed a set of system factors to help isolate the issues affecting system reliability. These factors are useful for relating the member-level reliability to the system-level reliability. Subsequent investigation of non-ideal systems revealed that an important notion in quantifying redundancy was one termed 'deterministic backup'; the factored form of the system equation should be enhanced to separate out this (deterministic) effect. This paper presents two alternative ways (direct, probabilistic and indirect, mean-oriented) to capture all of the system effects of probabilistic and deterministic origin. The results of some system reliability calculations in these formats are presented."
