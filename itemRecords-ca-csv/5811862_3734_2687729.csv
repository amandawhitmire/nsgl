14,Abstract:,"Oxylipins, oxygenated fatty acid metabolites of variable chain length, have been reported to be produced in hundreds of marine plants and invertebrates. With the diversity of oxylipins that are formed through a number of enzymatic pathways, it is necessary to use a series of spectroscopic methods to isolate and identify these metabolites. In this work, researchers discuss the methodology used to identify oxylipins produced by primitive marine organisms: a cyanobacterium, a red alga, a green alga, and the sole circulating hemocyte from the invertebrate ""Limulus polyphemus""."
