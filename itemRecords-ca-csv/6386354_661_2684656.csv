10,Abstract:,"The time is right for fresh California king salmon on the plate! Opening day for the California Commercial salmon fishing season started on May 1 and extends through October 12. The good news, says Aaron Newman, chairman of the California Salmon Council is that salmon from the American and Sacramento River System are rebuilding and, this year fishery managers are predicting strong returns which translates into a more robust season, the likes we haven't seen in seven years."
