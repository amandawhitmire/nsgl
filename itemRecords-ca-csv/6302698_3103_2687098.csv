8,Abstract:,"For almost thirty years, marine natural product chemists have studied sponges, ascidians and other marine invertebrates because of their ability to produce secondary metabolites with interesting chemical structures and potent biological activities. The wide array of interesting structures from these organisms makes them a very appealing group for drug development, which thrives on structural diversity. However, there are many biological uses for secondary metabolites that are not rooted in drug discovery. The aim of the emerging field of chemical genetics is to utilize these small molecules to dissect complex biological systems. Marine secondary metabolites have the potential to bind very specifically to mammalian proteins and these binding interactions can either inhibit or stimulate the protein's normal function. mission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission. Realizing the effects these molecules induce can then lead to a better understanding of the binding protein's primary role. This thesis examines the effects of marine natural products on two distinct intracellular transport events. Chapter 2 discusses the role of kinesin motor proteins in the transport of cargo within cells and to the cell surface and also reports new marine metabolites, the adociasulfates, that inhibit the movement of these proteins. Chapters 3-5 focus on how the overall structure of the Golgi apparatus is maintained and how cargo in transported between the cisternae. Small molecules from marine organisms that disrupt the organization of this organelle in vivo are described. In addition, the sponge-derived molecule ilimaquinone was used to isolate and characterize a Golgi-resident protein that is potentially involved in protein transport within the organelle."
