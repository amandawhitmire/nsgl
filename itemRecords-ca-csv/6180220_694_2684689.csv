7,Abstract:,"California grunion are endemic only to the coast of California and Baja California, and are found nowhere else in the world. Probably 90% of the population resides off the coast of three Southern California counties: San Diego, Orange, and Los Angeles. This marine fish, although it has never been common, is justifiably famous for its unique spawning behavior. Grunion reproduce by coming completely out of the water to lay their eggs on sandy beaches. Shortly after high tide, after the new or full moon, sections of these beaches may be covered with thousands of fish dancing about on the sand. Some of the largest, most consistent grunion runs occur in Orange County"
