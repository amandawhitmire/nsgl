9,Abstract:,"The purpose of this investigation was to examine the ultrastructure of the pleopod tegumental glands in female ""Homarus americanus"", utilizing specimens of various sizes and in different stages of ovarian maturity. Pleopods from adult males were also examined for evidence of similar glands. Pleopod tegumental glands are shown to be present in juvenile and adult females and in adult males and these glands have all the morphological features of true tegumental glands."
