10,Abstract:,"An extensive study of the diving behavior of female northern elephant seals was undertaken to determine the dive pattern of known-age females during the first 2-4 weeks at sea following lactation. Data on mass gain at sea, dive depth, dive duration, and surface interval duration between dives are reported to further the understanding of diving adaptations and foraging economics."
