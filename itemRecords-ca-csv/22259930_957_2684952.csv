13,Abstract:,"The North Coast Marine Protected Area (MPA) Study Region extends over 400 kilometers ofcoast from Alder Creek in Southern Mendocino County to the California-​Oregon border;encompas​sing some of California’s most rugged and rural coastline. The region contains threeprotected ports with full vessel services (Crescent City, Eureka, and Fort Bragg), plus two semiprotectedmo​oring basins with small boat launching capabilities at Trinidad and Shelter Cove,and a marina that can berth small boats on the Albion River.The nearshore rocky reef habitat along the North Coast supports a diverse assemblage ofculturally, ecologically, and economically important fishes. These include the Rockfishes(Seba​stes spp.), Lingcod (Ophidion elongatus), and Cabezon (Scorpaenichthy​s marmoratus)whic​h support recreational and commercial fisheries (Figure 1). Many of these rocky reefassociated fishes are slow growing, long lived, and mature late in life, making them particularlysus​ceptible to overfishing and, if depleted may require prolonged recovery periods. Our objectivewas to establish a baseline dataset for nearshore rocky reef fish assemblages in order to facilitatefutur​e monitoring and assessment of the North Coast MPA network."
