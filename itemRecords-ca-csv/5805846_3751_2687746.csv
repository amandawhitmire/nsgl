14,Abstract:,The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of a laboratory optical plankton counter (OPC) in determining size spectra of preserved zooplankton. The authors compare visual measurement of individual taxa and total displacement volume of whole samples to OPC analysis and discuss several experiments intended to test the effects of preservation on OPC-sensed sizes. They also present two applications of OPC-generated data in elucidating patterns for a large number of preserved samples.
