9,Abstract:,"As aquaculture has grown, so has the potential for increasing impacts on the environment and for increasing conflicts over the use of natural resources. The relationships between different forms of aquaculture and the environment are reviewed in this paper. Some examples of the form and magnitude of the environmental impacts caused by aquaculture operations are presented and analyzed. Strategies for minimizing the negative environmental impacts of aquaculture operations are discussed, including those of site selection and integration with other agricultural or industrial activities, input management, and water treatment and reuse."
