10,Abstract:,"An attempt will be made here to show how advantageous it is to look beyond the confines of the culture dish at benthic marine algae growing in the sea. I hope, by discussing selected examples, to conceptually bridge the gap that presently exists between the artificial world of the culture dish and the real world in the sea. In examining the ocean as a culture dish, the author first poses some questions about benthic marine algae in vitro and in situ, and then briefly discusses some exemplary studies of benthic algae in the sea. Subsequently, the author also describes the particular oceanic ""culture dish"" that we have been studying along the west coast of the United States, this being the submarine forest dominated by giant kelps. Lastly, the author will consider algal growth and reproduction as it occurs in such a forest."
