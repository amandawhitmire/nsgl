9,Abstract:,"Fish printing (""gyotaku"") originated in Japan or China in the early 1800s. In Japan, gyotaku is practiced by sportsmen to preserve records of their catches--a fish print never lies! In the United States, it has been popular as an art form for about 25 years. Practicing the art of gyotaku is a good way to gain appreciation of the beauty and great variety of marine organisms. The materials needed and the technique are described here."
