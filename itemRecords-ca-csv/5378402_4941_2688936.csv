9,Abstract:,"We are still lacking a quantitative evaluation of the risk of ""Clostridium botulinum"" toxigenesis in fish as it relates to type of fish, type and load of ""C. botulinum"" spores, storage temperatures, storage atmosphere and selected preservatives shown to delay toxigenesis. During the last three years we have been dealing with such quantitative aspects first in model broth systems and then in fish. Significant findings are discussed briefly in this presentation."
