12,Abstract:,"Coho salmon were hypophysectomiz​ed by a transorbital surgical technique which is described here. Hypophysectomiz​ed coho survived in fresh water but not in seawater. Plasma sodium levels were lower in hypophysectomiz​ed fish in fresh water and in 1/4 (isotonic) seawater than in sham-operated fish, suggesting impaired osmoregulatory function in hypophysectomiz​ed fish. In addition, Na+, K+-ATPase activity was reduced in hypophysectomiz​ed freshwater fish."
