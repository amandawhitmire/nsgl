13,Abstract:,"Fifty expendable current profilers (XCPs) were deployed off the northern California coast in late October 1984. Profiles of relative velocity and temperature were obtained at three sites: over the Pioneer Seamount, near an Oregon State University current meter mooring, and across a surface-​intensified front. The goal of this study was to examine the mean and near-inertial fields of motion at the three sites. The experimental design and instrument performance are discussed; sections of relative velocity and temperature are presented for each of the locations. Station pairs taken half an inertial period apart are plotted together showing the mean and inertial velocity fields."
