12,Abstract:,"The accessory nidamental gland (AN gland), a reproductive organ of the mature female squid ""Loligo opalescens,"" harbors a dense culture of bacteria of unknown function. A multilayered sheath surrounding the ""L. opalescens"" egg case is similarly colonized by bacteria that presumably originate in the AN gland, as evidenced by their presence in the egg case at oviposition. This study investigates how these bacteria are transmitted to juvenile squid and examines some morphological consequences of bacterial colonization of AN gland tissues. Because the AN gland develops a considerable time after hatching, it most likely acquires its symbionts horizontally from environmental seawater and not vertically from the egg case sheath."
