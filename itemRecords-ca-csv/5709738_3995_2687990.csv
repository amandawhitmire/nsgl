10,Abstract:,"Because tall cordgrass is needed for nesting by the endangered light-footed clapper rail, managers of constructed salt marshes in southern California are proposing large-scale nitrogen fertilization to improve cordgrass growth. How this might affect an existing infestation of scale insects (""Haliaspis spartina"") and the degree of damage these insects cause to their cordgrass hosts was unknown. The effects of timing and duration of fertilization on ""Haliaspis"" damage to cordgrass was explored, as well as the timing of ""Haliaspis"" dispersal, in a constructed marsh. Fertilization did not result in increased ""Haliaspis"" abundance. This study suggests that fertilization of constructed salt marshes in San Diego Bay may proceed without concern that further ""Haliaspis"" outbreaks will be facilitated."
