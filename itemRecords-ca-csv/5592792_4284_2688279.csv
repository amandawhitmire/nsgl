9,Abstract:,"With the signing of the UNCLOS III Convention (1982), the first phase of enclosure of the oceans has been achieved. New authority structures have been created for EEZs but new rules embodying rights and liabilities, as well as behavioral prescriptions, must be developed. 'Enclosure' and 'common (not communal) property' are not well understood, and attempts to apply these terms to the oceans as they pertain to land can be misleading. The ocean will always remain a 'physical common' by virtue of its indivisibility and open access. Despite human laws and boundaries, oceans can never become property in the same way land can. Thus metaphors of management policies implemented in the enclosure of the American West are of limited applicability."
