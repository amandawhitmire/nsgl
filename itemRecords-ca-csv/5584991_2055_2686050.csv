10,Abstract:,"The culture, reproduction, development, and growth of ""Nematostella"" are described, as well as some other aspects of its biology. This anemone reproduces sexually in standing water at room temperature, is readily raised through successive generations, is sexually active throughout the year, and shows no sign of seasonality in its reproduction in the laboratory. This combination of traits--namely asexual reproduction, which allows the development of clones, and sexual reproduction with subsequent development through larval stages to reproductive adults, all under room temperature culture conditions-​-​suggests that this sea anemone should be useful in the study of cnidarian biology, particularly development."
