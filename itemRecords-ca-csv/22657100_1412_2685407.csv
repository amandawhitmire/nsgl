19,Abstract:,"Seasonal phenological dynamics of vegetation hold important clues on ecosystem performance towards managementgoals​, such as carbon uptake, and thus should be considered in projections of their targeted services.Howeve​r, in wetlands spatio-temporal heterogeneity due to mixing of open water, soil, green and dead vegetationmakes it difficult to generalize ecosystem functioning across different regions. Remote sensing observationscan provide spatially-​explicit, cost-effective phenology indicators; however, little is known about theircapacity to indicate the links between wetland ecosystem structure and function. Here we assessed this potentialby comparing one-year Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from satellite products at high (5m; RapidEye) and low(30m; Landsat) spatial resolutions with eddy covariance time series of net carbon exchange, field digital camera(phenocam​) greenness and water temperature among three floristically similar restored wetlands in California,USA. Phenological timing differed by wetland site: depending on satellite, the range in site-median start ofgreening was up to 28 days, end of greening – up to 73 days, start of senescence – up to 79 days, and end ofsenescence – up to 10 days. Key transition dates from satellite inputs agreed with seasonal changes in net carbonexchange, phenocam greenness and water temperatures, suggesting that phenological contrasts could result inpart from site differences in vegetation configuration and litter affecting the exposure of canopy, soil and waterto sunlight and thus sub-canopy microclimate and ecosystem functioning. Yet, the agreement between satelliteinputs was non-systematic, with the greatest disparities at the more heterogeneous, less vegetated site. Phenologicalmod​el fitting uncertainty increased with greater spatial resolution, highlighting the tradeoff between theaccuracy of representing vegetation and the complexity of local seasonal variation. These findings highlight thesensitivity of satellite-​derived phenology to structural and functional heterogeneity of ecosystems and call formore rigorous spatially-​explicit analyses to inform assessments of restoration and management outcomes."
