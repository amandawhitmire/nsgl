9,Abstract:,"Recent Advances and Marine Technology, 2002 is the sixth refereed publication of a series based upon papers presented at the Tenth Pacific Congress on Marine Science and Technology (PACON 2002) held in Chiba, Japan, July 21-26, 2002. A unique process was adopted to bring about this refereed publication: session chairs selected papers based on presentations at PACON 2002 and recommended them for possible inclusion in this publication. Each manuscript was reviewed by at least two reviewers. Out of 199 PACON 2002 presentations, 143 papers were recommended by session chairmen, 68 manuscripts were submitted, and finally 55 papers were accepted for this publication. Since papers dealt in areas of ocean science and technology (OST), coastal science and technology (CST), and marine resource management and development (MRMD), we have tried to group related papers to facilitate the reader's use of this publication. I hope that readers will find this volume of 55 papers useful. Indexes giving the alphabetized list of authors and titles are presented at the end of this volume."
