9,Abstract:,"The struggle to protect and restore endangered salmon populations is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. Native, naturally spawning stocks of salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat trout are at risk of extinction in Oregon, Washington, California, and Idaho. These reports provide a unique ""oral history"" of the recent public discussion over the fate of the Northwest salmon. Produced for radio, the reports give the listener a sense of immediacy, of contact with the ideas and feelings that shape current events. They seek to clarify and explain, to offer some perspective and insight on a multifaceted problem, and provide a foundation for understanding that should be of value for some time to come."
