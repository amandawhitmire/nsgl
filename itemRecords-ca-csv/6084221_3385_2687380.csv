10,Abstract:,"While proponents of Earth Systems Education see unquestionable value in promoting Earth as the integrating focus for science education K- 12, most recognize that the precollege education enterprise has far to go to accommodate such innovation. Until a greater level of curriculum restructure can be achieved, it is often necessary to accept Earth Systems implementation on the basis of infusion. Simply put, teachers select an appropriate topic and modify their teaching to focus on the interactions of the Earth system, using materials and methods that are more engaging and relevant, relating to the students in their own environment and based on their prior knowledge. The process replaces more traditional learning hut supposedly achieves a better outcome. In spite of high enthusiasm and documented gains, however, an infused program is often nearly invisible to outsiders because it is topic-specific and therefore not in constant use. The Earth Systems and Ohio Sea Grant Education Programs at The Ohio State University have developed Demonstration Schools that serve, as models for infusion of interdisciplinaâ€‹ry Lake Erie science in an Earth systems context. In each participating urban, parochial, and subur- ban Cleveland school several science teachers enrolled in five graduate courses over 15 months. Participation required that the teachers teach at least one unit of science using innovative program materials (Earth Systems Education Activities for Great Lakes Schools), conduct pre- and posttests of content and process skills among their students, and hold an open house for other teachers and the community. In suburban and parochial schools, students performed the activities for the Open House. Their programs were attended by other teachers, parents, and school board members. Innovation was more difficult in urban schools, but in all cases the participating schools succeeded in attracting others to their Lake Erie science program to share student work and response to the methods of ESE. Test scores indicate science process skills increased for all classes over the project period. The schools are now on call to demonstrate their work to other visitors, and the teachers are active in the state science teachers network, a further means of distributing the successful model for innovation in Earth Systems Education."
