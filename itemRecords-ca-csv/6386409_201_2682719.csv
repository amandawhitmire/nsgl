16,Abstract:,"This report presents results of a survey of California coastal managers that shows that neither the state nor coastal communities are standing by until science and policy questions are settled. Communities along both the open ocean coast and along bay and estuarine shorelines are beginning to plan for climate change impacts. Despite scientific uncertainties and the economic challenges of recent years, they are rising to the challenge of coastal climate change. In light of already experienced changes, and the scientifically robust projections of additional and accelerating impacts of climate change in the future, this survey aimed to assess coastal professionals' concerns with climate change impacts, their activities to date to plan and prepare for them, and the needs and barriers they encounter in planning for climate change."
