7,Abstract:,"Commercial fishing is twice as dangerous as coal mining and seven times deadlier than the average industrial occupation. All the dangers associated with fishing cannot be eliminated, but lives and boats can be saved if fishing vessels carry proper safety equipment and if crew members know what to do in an emergency. Hundreds of immigrants from Vietnam have entered U.S. fisheries in the last decade. To address the special needs of this growing sector of the fishing industry, a safety videotape, in Vietnamese, covers safety and survival equipment, how to send a MAYDAY call, and the basics of navigation. Viewers learn about U.S. Coast Guard-required safety equipment, what to do in an emergency, and how to make a distress call and give their location in English."
