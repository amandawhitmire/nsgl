14,Abstract:,"The bastadins are a family of highly modified tetrapeptides occuring in the marine sponges ""Ianthella"" spp. and ""Psammaplysilla purpurea"". Bastadins 1-7 exhibit moderate antibacterial activity, while other bastadins have been shown to have in vitro cytotoxic activity against human tumor cell lines or antiinflammatorâ€‹y activity. This paper reports the isolation of two new analogues from ""I. basta"" and two novel sulfate half-esters."
