13,Abstract:,"Here the authors attempt to explain spatial variability in recruitment of red sea urchins (""Strongylocent​rotus franciscanus"") in the context of mesoscale features of the circulation associated with two distinct promontories in northern California-​Point Reyes and Point Arena. They propose that areas subject to more frequent warming during upwelling relaxations will experience higher recruitment because larvae are retained in the non-upwelled, warmer water and transported to shore."
