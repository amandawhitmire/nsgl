10,Abstract:,"During three years of California Sea Grant College funding, we developed a rocky intertidal monitoring program that can be used by NOAA's National Marine Sanctuary program on the west coast. The goals were to 1) inform the public about the rocky intertidal habitat and the species that live there, 2) directly involve students (7th - 12th grade) and volunteers in the field collecting long-term data, and 3) collect and archive data that can be analyzed to detect changes in intertidal life over time. We developed protocols and species lists, and tested the student's ability to identify and monitor intertidal species compared to professional intertidal technicians. With limited preliminary training (a classroom visit for protocol and species overview, and a few field trips to learn the species using photo-identification sheets and to do practice counts), the students were able to collect data in the field that were comparable to those collected by professionals. Protocols have been established for 9 sites in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and used by 6 school groups to date. These protocols, currently posted on the website <http://simp.ucsc.edu>, are being incorporated into the education and research programs of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary <http://bonita.mbnms.nos.noaa.gov>, and eventually will be part of a program coordinated by the five west coast national marine sanctuaries, Long-term Monitoring Program and Experiential Training for Students (LiMPETS)."
