10,Abstract:,"This paper develops a conceptual model emphasizing relationships between beach-going and individual characteristicsâ€‹, geographical access, coastal knowledge, interaction with coastal environments, and attitudes toward nature. The authors use a survey of Los Angeles County residents to explore beach-going in this urban coastal region characterized by cultural diversity, large immigrant populations, and a rich assemblage of marine wildlife. Findings from tobit analysis suggest beach use rates vary significantly by age, race/ethnicity, class, and immigrant status, by distance between home and beach, and by beach recreational activity preferences. Attitudes toward nature also shape decisions about spending leisure time at the beach, and warrant more attention in leisure research."
