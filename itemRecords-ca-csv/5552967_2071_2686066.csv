9,Abstract:,This article reviews the current state of the art of underwater sensors and the short-term prospects for improved imaging systems. Both optical and sonar sensor technology are surveyed and the performance of the imaging systems is examined within the context of the requirements for underwater robotic vision sensors. Currently available commercial technology is surveyed as well as a number of systems that are currently under development in research labs. Applications of sensors in particular operating environments are noted.
