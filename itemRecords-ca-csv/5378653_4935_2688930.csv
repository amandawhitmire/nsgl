10,Abstract:,"Alaskan king crab has recently become one of the most abundant and valuable crustacean fisheries in the world. However, since late 1981 biologists have noticed marked decreases in clutch on red king crabs in the Kodiak and Cook Inlet regions. Associated with the mortality of these eggs is the presence of large numbers of nemertean worms (genus ""Carcinonemerte​s"") which prey on eggs of decapod crustaceans. The initial observations stimulated an extensive sampling program to ascertain the distribution of ""Carcinonemerte​s"" and quantify its role in mortality of king crab eggs. Preliminary results are described."
