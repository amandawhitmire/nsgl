11,Abstract:,"In this work, scientists show that human monoclonal antibodies can be expressed in transgenic algae chloroplasts. They engineered a large single-chain antibody in the chloroplast of the unicellular green alga ""Chlamydomonas reinhardtii"". This antibody is directed against herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D. The antibody accumulates as a soluble protein in transgenic chloroplants and binds herpes virus proteins as determined by ELISA assays."
