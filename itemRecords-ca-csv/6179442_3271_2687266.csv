11,Abstract:,"Nature has evolved several biosynthetic strategies for the incorporation of halogen atoms into natural organic compounds depending upon the reactivity (or lack thereof) of the organic substrate. Most halogenating enzymes are oxidative in nature and utilize either hydrogen peroxide or molecular oxygen in order to change the oxidation state of the halide to generate a reactive halogen species for catalysis. In this presentation, two new halogenation processes involved in the biosynthesis of the marine microbial natural products salinosporamide A and the napyradiomycins will be discussed. The biosynthesis of the β-lactone anticancer agent salinisporamide A involves a SAM-dependent chlorinase whose function, mechanism and evolution illuminate a new biochemical reaction towards an unprecedented halogenated polyketide synthase substrate. The biosynthesis of A80915C and other napyradiomycin meroterpenoid antibiotics, on the other hand, revealed unprecedented bacterial V-dependent chloroperoxidas​e chemistry involving three distinct chloroperoxidas​es that putatively deliver halogens in a regio and stereospecific manner and facilitate chloronium-​assisted isoprenoid cyclization reactions."
