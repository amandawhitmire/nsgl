14,Abstract:,"Suboptimal fi sh stocking densities in experimental systems may elicitstress responses that can affect experimen- tal results. Fish species, age and size, water chemistry and fl ow, and physical characteristics of the experimental system (e.g., tank, cage) are among the parameters to be considered when determining stocking densities. However, systematic studies to de fi ne fi sh densities minimizing stress in experimental systems are rarely performed. This is particularly true when working with species of low aquaculture value or a non-model test species such as the Delta Smelt ( Hypomesus transpaci fi cus ). The aim of this study was to use physiological stress biomarkers to determine suitable fi sh densities for speci fi c experimental vessels routinely used for this species. We maintained late larval Delta Smelt (60 days post-hatch; dph) over a period of 24 h, at fi ve different densities: 7,14, 28,42,and 56 fi shper8 L circular fi shtank.We assessedwhole body cortisoland transcriptomic biomarkers that lead to cortisol production to quantify stress levels. Both marker types delivered similar results. Cortisol levels were lowest at densities of 28 and 42 fi sh per tank, whereas lowest fi sh densities (7 and 14 fi sh per tank) evoked the highest stress levels. Genes such as Mineralocortico​id Receptor 1 and Glucocorticoid Receptor 2, as well as 11-​Beta-​Hydroxysteroid-​Dehydrogenase-​2 depicted the lowest expression levels at stocking densi- ties 28 and 42, and elevated expression levels for stocking densities 7 and 14. Our data support the observations that late larval Delta Smelt should be exposed, acclimated, and cultured in groups rather than as individuals or in low numbers. This study indicates the importance of adequately de fi ning experimental conditions that minimize stress, speci fi cally when stress is measured as an endpoint. In addition to classical cortisol measurements, responses of the transcriptome also appear suitable in assessing stress responses in fi sh, and in determining optimal holding conditions, particularly if short-term responses are the study focus. Statement of relevance The study highlights the importance of evaluating stress in order to determine species-​speci fi c stocking densities. The results are thus relevant to a wide audience in the fi eld of aquaculture and experimental biology."
