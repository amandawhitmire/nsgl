10,Abstract:,"A new species of ""Zoanthus"" from the Bay of Bengal contains a novel group of alkaloids that possess anti-​inflammatory and analgesic properties. The structures of two new isomeric alkaloids, 28-​deoxyzoanthenam​ine and 22-​epi-​28-​deoxyzoanthenam​ine, were elucidated by interpretation of spectral data and are reported here."
