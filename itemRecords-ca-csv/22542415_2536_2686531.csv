16,Abstract:,"A food system includes all processes and infrastructure in place to feed a population. The overarching components of the food system are inputs, production, manufacturing and processing, storage and distribution, consumption, labor and workforce development, and disposal of food and food-related products. All these components are interconnected and can effect positive or negative impacts to the social, environmental, and economic conditions of a population, also known as the triple bottom line. Using this triple bottom line as a lens to assess the conditions of a food system and to guide its future state recognizes the role that the food system plays in people’s health and wellbeing, as well as its effect on environmental sustainability and on the economic welfare of society. In 2016, the County of San Diego (County*) Board of Supervisors initiated the Live Well San Diego Food System Initiative to work towards a robust and resilient local food system that builds healthy communities, supports the economy, and enhances the environment. One of the main priorities for the Food System Initiative is to develop the State of the Food System Report for the San Diego Region on a cyclical basis. The purpose of this report is to understand what the food system looks like in San Diego county, its current state, its challenges, and areas of opportunity. The report also identifies metrics to track progress in the different areas of the food system. The goal is for this report and its future iterations to serve as an informative resource for community education and engagement and also help inform programs and policy change. The creation of the State of the Food System Report was led by the County in close collaboration with the San Diego Food System Alliance and with the input and contributions of representatives from government agencies, nonprofits, academic and research institutions, and industry groups from throughout the San Diego region. Next steps will include establishing partnerships to identify, prioritize, and pursue key opportunities that stem from this report and previous efforts to make improvements in the different areas of the food system. This effort will require the continued collaboration of all organizations and stakeholders involved in the creation of this report as well as the engagement of community, industry, and decision makers in the region."
