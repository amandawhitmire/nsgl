9,Abstract:,"For public health reasons, California laws require posting a sign in retail food establishments to remind and protect consumers with high risk factors from eating certain raw or undercooked foods that may be potentially harmful to their medical condition. Raw, untreated oysters from the Gulf of Mexico are regulated under provision contained in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 17, Section 13675. This 2003 law requires retail food facilities (includes restaurants) to provide a written warning in English and Spanish to any consumer who orders raw, untreated oysters from the Gulf of Mexico."
