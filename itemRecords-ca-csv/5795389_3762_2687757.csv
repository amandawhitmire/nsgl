16,Abstract:,"HIV encodes three enzymes, reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), and integrase (IN). Inhibitors of the first two have been extremely useful for treating HIV-infected people, particularly when used in combination. Integrase is also a promising target, since there are no similar proteins known to be important for normal function of cells. Thus inhibitors of integrase might be relatively nontoxic. Despite extensive efforts, no clinically useful integrase inhibitors have yet been developed. Researchers here described lamellarin ""alpha"" 20- sulfate, a new marine natural product with inhibitory activity against integrase, PICs and HIV virus in cell culture."
