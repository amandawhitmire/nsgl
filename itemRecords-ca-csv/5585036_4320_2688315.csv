10,Abstract:,"Imadazole alkaloids have recently been reported as antimicrobial constitutents of the calcareous sponges ""Leucetta chagosensis"" and ""Clathrina clathrus"". Among the more interesting of the imidazole alkaloids is clathridine, which was isolated from ""C. clathrus"" as a very stable zinc complex. As part of a continuing program to discover new bioactive metabolites from marine organisms, a bright yellow sponge ""Leucetta microhaphis"" collected in Pohnpei was examined. (9E)-​Clathridine 9-N-(2- sulfoethyl)imin​e was isolated as yellow needles; the molecular formula, C18H20N6O6S, was determined by high-resolution mass measurement."
