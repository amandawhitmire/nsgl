10,Abstract:,"In order to facilitate the involvement of the shipping industry as a stakeholder in the process of cooperative policy-making as well as support the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) and the Sanctuary Advisory Council (SAC) in its efforts to make science-based, cooperative policy decisions the study was undertaken. In it we will identify the social, economic and political constraints influencing the commercial shipping industry through interaction with the Southern California Marine Exchange, Terminal Operators and Shipping Agents in the Port of Long Beach. It is intended to clarify the various jurisdictions and stakeholders involved in commercial shipping behavior within Santa Barbara Channel and outline possible actions which could be implemented by these groups and agencies. The research will compile and analyze potential management actions in terms of economic and political feasibility versus expected ecological benefits. Is the potential risk reduction worth the cost to industry? Is it possible to create effective outreach and education materials for both the SAC and the shipping industry?"
