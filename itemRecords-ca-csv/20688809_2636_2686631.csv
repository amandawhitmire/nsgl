15,Abstract:,"While the seasonality of wind-driven coastal upwelling in eastern boundary upwelling systems has long beenestablished​, many studies describe two distinct seasons (upwelling and non-upwelling), a generalized frameworkthat does not capture details relevant to marine ecosystems. In this contribution, we present a more detaileddescrip​tion of the annual cycle and upwelling seasonality for an understudied location along the centralCaliforn​ia coast. Using both the mean monthly upwelling favorable wind stress and the monthly standard deviation,we define the following seasons (contiguous months) and a transitional period (non-contiguous months):“Winter Storms” season (Dec-Jan-Feb), “Upwelling Transition” period (Mar and Jun), “Peak Upwelling” season(Apr-​May), “Upwelling Relaxation” season (Jul-Aug-Sep), and “Winter Transition” season (Oct-Nov). In order todescribe the oceanic response to this upwelling wind seasonality, we take advantage of nearly a decade of fullwater-​column measurements of temperature and chlorophyll made using an automated profiling system at theend of the California Polytechnic State University Pier in San Luis Obispo Bay, a small (~ 2 km wide near studysite) and shallow (~ 10 m average bay depth) coastal embayment. Variability and average-year patterns aredescribed inside the bay during the various upwelling seasons. Moreover, the role of the local coastline orientationand topography on bay dynamics is also assessed using long-term measurements collected outside ofthe bay. The formation of a seasonally variable upwelling shadow system and potential nearshore retention zoneis discussed. The observations presented provide a framework on which to study interannual changes to theaverage-year seasonal cycle, assess the contribution of higher-​frequency features to nearshore variability, andbetter predict dynamically and ecologically important events."
