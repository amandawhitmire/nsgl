7,Abstract:,"This study was the first to comprehensively assess and compare the efficacy of boater outreach aimed at preventing the introduction and spread of (AIS) in five states. Boaters in California, Kansas, Minnesota, Ohio, and Vermont were surveyed by mail (53% of 1,952 boaters responded) to determine their awareness of AIS and the actions they took or would be willing to take to prevent the spread of AIS. Boaters were especially knowledgeable and took greater levels of action at water accesses in Minnesota (90%) and Vermont (82%) than in Ohio (45%), California (40%), and Kansas (30%). An indication that AIS outreach can sustain behavior is the 20% increase in taking desired actions by Minnesota boaters; 70% reported taking action in 1994. Importantly, when asked about the likelihood of taking actions in the future, intent for action rose to over 94% in each state. Boaters reported taking action based on such attitudes as ""a sense of personal responsibility""​, ""a desire to keep AIS out of our lakes"", and ""prevent damage to my boat and equipment"". Comparing these survey results to those previously reported by boaters in each state, the frequency of potential introduction of AIS (a.k.a., propagule pressure) decreased between 57-93%. This study demonstrates that effective AIS outreach can motivate boaters to act regardless of region. It also reveals that boaters will most likely take action if outreach is made a priority, targets the most important means for outreach, frames value on personal actions that are effective in preventing spread (self-​efficacy), and conveys consistent messages. Human dimensions research offers an opportunity to improve AIS outreach, and help sustain and influence behaviors among boaters. More effective outreach offers an opportunity improve AIS management and policy."
