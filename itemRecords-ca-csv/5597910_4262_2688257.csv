11,Abstract:,"The insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) circulate bound to specific binding proteins (IGF-BPs). IGF-BPs are believed to play important roles in regulating IGF-I stimulated growth without the occurrence of insulin-like side effects, to increase the half-life of IGFs in the circulation, and to assist in the targeting of IGFs to their responsive tissues. This study reports that IGF-BPs were demonstrated in the circulation of four teleost fish species, coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch""), striped bass (""Morone saxatilis""), tilapia (""Oreochromis mossambicus""), and longjawed mudsucker (""Gillichthys mirabilis"")."
