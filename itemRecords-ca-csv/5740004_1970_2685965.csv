16,Abstract:,"The authors have developed a computer-aided system (Bony Parts) to analyze periodic bands in fish otoliths (or other structures) for age estimation. The image analysis program first scans the image of a thin otolith section, perpendicular to the bands specified by the user. Adjacent scans are averaged and filtered. Bands of higher density are detected, marked, and summed on the screen. The authors then evaluated this new technique using subsamples of thin- sectioned otoliths from the bank rockfish. The computer- aided technique reduced the time and tedium of counting bands, yet still allowed the user to interactively make subjective decisions about aging criteria. Both approaches produced similar readings, but computer-aided estimates were more precise than traditional readings and required less analysis time."
