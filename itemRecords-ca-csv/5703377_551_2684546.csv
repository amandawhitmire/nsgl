12,Abstract:,"In 1991 red urchins became California's most valuable fishery, worth 34 million dollars ex-vessel price. However, red urchin landings in northern California have dramatically declined. Red sea urchins (""Strongylocentâ€‹rotus franciscanus""), residing in shallow habitats in Bodega Bay, California are morphologically distinct and possibly enhance recruitment by spawning larvae and sheltering juveniles. This suggests shallow beds of urchins would be ideal candidates for harvest refugia promoting the production of larvae to replenish deeper harvested habitats. Red urchins from shallow beds (5 m) had significantly heavier gonads. External morphological characteristics (e.g., spine length) could be used to ensure the protection of reproductive urchins in shallow harvest refugia offering an alternative urchin management strategy for northern California."
