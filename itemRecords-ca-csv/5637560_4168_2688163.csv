12,Abstract:,"Increases in synoptic data and advances in understanding of oceanographic processes in the coastal zone off Washington, Oregon and northern California can be used to better understand the dynamic behavior of exploited populations. Three examples from the Pacific Northwest are presented: an anadromous fish, coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch""); a benthic flatfish, English sole (""Parophrys vetulus""), that spawns in nearshore areas and has pelagic larvae; and a benthic crustacean, Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister""), that also has pelagic larvae and utiltizes near-shore and estuarine areas. Because the dependence of these species on oceanographic conditions is only partially understood, the picture is necessarily incomplete (i.e., lines of evidence for competing hypotheses and statistical relationships with conflicting explanations). As an aid to assessing the implications of these various pieces of evidence, the examples begin with a brief introduction to the approaches researchers have taken to understanding environmental influences on exploited marine populations."
