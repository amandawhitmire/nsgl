11,Abstract:,"In previous Sea Grant workshops on kelp bed resources, participants called for an increase in interdisciplina​ry interactions that would link biological, physical, and social scientists with resource managers, policy makers, and industry representatives​. This meeting was held in an effort to address that need. Although the need for interdisplinary approaches to research and management is recognized throughout the world, the means to achieve such an approach are not fully developed. Many of the identified research objectives for kelp bed resources would require studies of long duration and broad geographic range. Workshop participants discussed the need to bridge institiutional gaps and to fund studies appropriately, so that research results can reflect both the spatial and temporal scales of the parameters or species being studied. It is essential that interdisciplina​ry investigations of kelp bed resources begin now, but the means to pursue interdisciplina​ry approaches to research and management also need to be further explored."
