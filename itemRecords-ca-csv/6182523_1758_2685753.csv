12,Abstract:,"We have developed methods for transplanting and recovering individual spionid polychaetes from intertidal sediments to directly measure changes in the growth of individuals. Most spionids are small, tube-dwelling macrofauna that tend to deposit feed in still water and suspension feed in faster flows. Because these worms rapidly colonize disturbed sediments and are important items in the diets of bottom-feeding fishes and shorebirds, knowledge about the population dynamics of spionids can help gauge the functioning of benthic ecosystems. Live Polydora were collected from the Tijuana Estuary, and the body sizes of individual worms were measured by microscopy and image analysis. We then transplanted small vials containing individual, pre-measured worms back into the intertidal sediments in a marsh channel. After 14 days in the field, we successfully recovered approximately one third of the transplanted worms and re-measured their body sizes. Recovered worms more than doubled in size during the 14-day period. On average, the relative growth rates of individuals were 9% per day. There also was a trend toward faster growth of worms planted at lower elevations in the intertidal. These in-situ growth rates are between those from still-water laboratory experiments and those measured in laboratory flumes, in which suspension-â€‹feeding worms were continuously submerged in flowing seawater. The transplantation methods we developed allow for a variety of hypotheses concerning the growth of infauna to be tested in situ, including the effects of hydrodynamic conditions, spatial and temporal variability of organic inputs, and the density of individuals."
