10,Abstract:,"Acoustic methods for multi-species assessments typically rely on accurate target strength models at one or several frequencies in order to differentiate between species based on the average energy intensity. However, in cases where the average echo intensity is insufficient to separate the species, further information is required in order to achieve accurate population assessments. In order to enhance the accuracy of multi-species assessments, we have conducted a series of experiments using multi-view scatter over a broad frequency range to classify fish of several species. The primary benefit of this approach is that the multi-view data coupled with the broad spectrum insonification can mitigate overlap in echo intensity which is due to uncertainty in body shape and orientation. Thus, by carefully combining the data from each view, dramatic improvements in classification accuracy are obtained. The approach is evaluated on laboratory data collected from eight different species with a custom built multi-view scattering apparatus. Data are collected for two individuals from each species over all orientations in the plane of the system. Classification algorithms are then applied to differentiate between combinations of species with varying degrees of overlap in body shape. In all cases, the multiview data show dramatic improvements in classification accuracy ranging from 60% to 90% over the corresponding single-view data."
