12,Abstract:,"The prevalence and distribution of ""Nadelspora canceri"", a recently described microsporidian parasite of the Dungeness crab, was studied and analyzed by sex and size of host crab and date of collection. ""N. canceri"" was widely distributed along the United States Pacific Coast from Bodega Bay, California, to southern Washington. The parasite also occurred offshore. Infection in crabs captured in the open ocean was low, and in crabs taken from nearshore it was intermediate between estuarine and open-ocean levels. The infection was most prevalent (22.4%) in 2-yr-old crabs, and males had 2.5 times higher rate of infection than did females. No significant annual or seasonal variations in infection prevalence were detected."
