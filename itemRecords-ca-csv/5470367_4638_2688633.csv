8,Abstract:,"Tissue lipid content and lipolytic enzyme activity was determined in selected tissues of coho salmon, ""Oncorhynchus kisutch"", at various developmental stages (freshwater parr, freshwater smolt, seawater smolt, and seawater stunt) and in tissues of coho salmon and chinook salmon, ""O. tshawytscha"", exposed to seawater periodically during smoltification. The results indicate that exposure to seawater stimulates lipid depletion in juvenile salmon and that the depletion can be explained, in part, by increased depot lipase activity. Furthermore, these data confirm that metabolic dysfunction is associated with stunting."
