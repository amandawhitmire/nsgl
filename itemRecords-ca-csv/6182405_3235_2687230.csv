8,Abstract:,"The main goal of this project was to measure relative abundance, size and movement of nearshore fishes caught by anglers in a heavily fished area located north of San Francisco called Duxbury reef. This study is unique in the level of participation of about 200 anglers, all of whom volunteered to help catch, tag and release fish. The participation of these anglers was essential for data collection; and as importantly, it also gave scientists an opportunity to demonstrate fisheries science directly to this key ""stakeholder"" group."
