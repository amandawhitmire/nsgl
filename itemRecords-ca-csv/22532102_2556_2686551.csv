14,Abstract:,"Laboratory experiments employing radiotracer methodology were conducted to determinethe assimilation efficiencies from ingested natural seston, the influx rates from the dissolvedphase and the efflux rates of 6 trace elements (Ag, Am, Cd, Co. Se and Zn) in the mussel Mytilus edulis.A kinetic model was then employed to predict trace element concentration in mussel tissues in 2 locationsfor which mussel and environmental data are well described: South San Francisco Bay (California,USA​) and Long Island Sound [New York, USA). Assimilation efficiencies from natural sestonranged from 5 to 18"": for Ag, 0.6 to 1% for Am, 8 to 20% for Cd, 12 to 16% for CO, 28 to 34% for Se,and 32 to 41 ':, for Zn. Differences in chlorophyll a concentration in ingested natural seston did not havesignificant impact on the assimilation of Am, CO, Se and Zn. The influx rate of elements from the dissolvedphase increased with the dissolved concentration, conforming to Freundlich adsorptionisoth​erms. The calculated dissolved uptake rate constant was greatest for Ag, followed by Zn > Am -;Cd > CO> Se. The estimated absorption efficiency from the d~ssolvedp hase was 1.53 % for Ag, 0.34 %for Am, 0.31 X for Cd, 0.11 % for CO, 0.03""' for Se and 0.89% for Zn. Salinity had an inverse effect onthe influx rate from the dissolved phase and dissolved organic carbon concentration had no significanteffe​ct on trace element uptake. The calculated efflux rate constants for all elements ranged from 1.0 to3.0% d-' The route of trace element uptake (food vs dissolved) and the duration of exposure to dissolvedtrace elements (12 h vs 6 d) did not significantly influence trace element efflux rates. A modelwhich used the experimentally determined influx and efflux rates for each of the trace elements, followingexposu​re from ingested food and from water, predicted concentrations of Ag. Cd, Se and Zn inmussels that were directly comparable to actual tissue concentrations independently measured in the 2reference sites in national monitoring programs. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the total suspendedsolids load, which can affect mussel feeding activity, assimilation, and trace element concentration inthe dissolved and particulate phases, can significantly influence metal bioaccumulation for particlereactiv​eelements such as Ag and Am. For all metals, concentrations in mussels are proportionately​related to total metal load in the water column and their assimilation efficiency from ingested particles.Furth​er, the model predicted that over 96% of Se in mussels is obtained from ingested food, under conditionstypic​al of coastal waters. For Ag, Am, Cd, CO and Zn, the relative contribution from the dissolvedphase decreases significantly with increasing trace element parhtion coefficients for suspendedpartic​les and the assimilation efficiency in mussels of ingested trace elements, values range between33 and 67% for Ag, 5 and 17% for Am, 47 and 82% for Cd, 4 and 30% for CO, and 17 and 51 ?h for Zn."
