10,Abstract:,"This article develops a new algorithm for accurate cloud detection in AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) scenes over land. The algorithm, called the AVHRR Split-and -Merge Clustering (ASMC) cloud-detection algorithm, uses an iterative, nested partitional, hierarchical clustering procedure to segment the AVHRR scene into its natural divisions and then a joint, three- dimensional, adaptive thresholding procedure to label the segments as cloudy, cloud-free or uncertain."
