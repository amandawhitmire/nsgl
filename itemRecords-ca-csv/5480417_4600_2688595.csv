11,Abstract:,"A variety of organisms are known to accumulate amino acids in response to cold temperatures. These amino acids are thought to play a role in preventing damage to cell structure during freeze stress. In this study the ability of various amino acids to protect small unilamellar vesicles against damage during freeze/thaw was compared in the presence and absence of plasma levels of salt. Amino acids with hydrocarbon side chains less than three carbons long were cryoprotective only in the presence of salt; apparently NaCl selectively increases the solubility of such amino acids, allowing them to act as cryoprotectants​. In contrast, amino acids with side chains containing charged amine groups were cryoprotective regardless of the presence of salt. Evidence suggests an interaction between the positively-​charged second amine group of the amino acid and the negatively-​charged phospholipid headgroup."
