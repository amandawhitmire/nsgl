9,Abstract:,"In 2006, The Biological Bulletin initiated the idea of publishing ""virtual symposia,"" a series of papers, in a single issue, on a compelling theme that is central to the scope of this journal. The inaugural virtual symposium, on marine invertebrate models of learning and memory, was introduced in an article by McPhie and Miller (2006). Here, we present the second chapter, focusing on ""The Neuroecology of Chemical Defense."" The present symposium was inspired by recent discoveries in chemical ecology, which itself is derived from multiple infusions of new ideas over the last half century. Studies in chemical ecology share the common trait of using chemistry to explain biological interactions at the level of individual organisms, populations, or communities. Chemical ecology currently has at least two major, independent branches. The first, chemical communication, developed through pioneering investigations by notable ethologists."
