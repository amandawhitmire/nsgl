10,Abstract:,"Recognizing the potential for confusion about the names of fish sold in restaurants and markets, groups within the California seafood industry have been trying for years to standardize nomenclature for seafood. In 1986 the West Coast Fisheries Development Foundation was granted federal funding to complete the California seafood industry's preliminary list of acceptable and preferred names for seafoods sold in that state. The California Fisheries and Seafood Institute has served as catalyst and principal investigator, soliciting information from its members as well as providing statewide industry reviews of the list. Other seafood industry groups, food service associations, consumer groups, and government agencies have provided valuable input. The result is a handbook for restaurants, retailers, and their seafood suppliers which provides nomenclature guidelines for seafood species sold in California. It is hoped that these guidelines will serve as a basis for communication in the sale, preparation, and serving of fish and seafood."
