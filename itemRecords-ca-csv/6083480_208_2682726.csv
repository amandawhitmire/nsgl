8,Abstract:,"The oceans of the world remain one of the great mysteries to many of us. While the oceans cover a huge expanse of the surface of our planet, the population of the United States is relatively uninformed about the physics, chemistry, geology and biology of these vast water bodies. Many people who live only a short distance from the oceans have never seen them and the majority of the population living in the interior of the country has never ventured to the ocean shore. Teaching about the seas is not in the mainstream of the American educational system and as a result the state of ocean literacy is relatively poor in the United States. This paper describes efforts by Sea Grant to improve ocean literacy in the United States. There are a wide variety of marine science educational programs available to students ranging from K to 12, undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral and adult programs offered by many different groups. These programs range from small summer camps for K-12 students to large undergraduate programs that draw students from throughout the country. The marine science education enterprise in the United States is comprised mostly of small programs that create a loose network of educational opportunities. There are a few widely coordinated programs such as those offered by the Sea Grant network. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the marine education programs offered by the Sea Grant network."
