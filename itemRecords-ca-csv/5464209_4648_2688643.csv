9,Abstract:,"Accidental damage to offshore installations can have potentially devastating consequences in terms of human life as well as environmental impact. Collision between vessels and platforms is now recognized as the largest single cause of offshore accidents. A better understanding of the hydrodynamic phenomena involved in the collision process can yield some useful information on the time-varying design loads to be used in the analysis of the resistance of an offshore platform. Outlined here are the traditional methods used in the study of the motion of bodies piercing the free surface under simplifying assumptions of linearization. An application of linear theory to the transient motion of ships is presented, with a special emphasis on the problem of collision involving ships. Several important aspects of the collision problem, not accounted for by linear theory, are examined; some mathematical techniques to predict nonlinear effects due to the presence of a free surface and their applications for the study of collision are reviewed. Numerical methods available to solve the linear as well as the complete nonlinear problem and the difficulties associated with their implementation are discussed."
