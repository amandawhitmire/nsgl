11,Abstract:,"One of the most fundamental measurements used for characterizing marine environments is primary production, the production of organic matter from inorganic constituents (most commonly through photosynthesis)â€‹. Primary production estimates are typically made using the radioactive carbon -14 tracer technique introduced by Steeman Nielsen (1952) where the investigator adds a trace amount of radioactive carbon to a water sample and quantifies the radioactive enrichment of particulate organic matter during an incubation period. The technique is dependent upon precise determination of both radioactive enrichment and ambient dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration in the sample. While determining radioactivity is relatively easy with the use of a liquid scintillation counter, direct determination of DIC concentrations is often more difficult as few laboratories have the necessary instrumentation available. Traditionally in oceanic studies, DIC concentrations were based on a constant approximate value of 2000 umol L-1 (i.e. Eppley & Sharp, 1975; Sharp, personal communication, see ""Notes"") or based on measurements of salinity and pH (Parsons et al., 1984). These methods of approximation can be made within a salinity range of 22-33 psu (Parsons et al., 1984) and are therefore of limited use for work in estuaries, such as the San Francisco estuary (SFE), where salinity varies between 0 and >33 psu. Previous 14C based estimates of primary production in the SFE required direct determination of DIC concentrations (e.g. Cole & Cloern, 1984, Jassby et. al. 2002)."
