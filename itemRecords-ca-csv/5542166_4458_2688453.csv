11,Abstract:,"Binding sites for native chum salmon growth hormone (sGH) in coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") hepatic membranes were analyzed by radioreceptor assay. Specific binding was greatest in liver membranes, and was also detected in muscle, ovary, gill, kidney, and brain. Scatchard analyses indicated a single class of hepatic binding sites that were specific for sGH. In stunts, abnormal seawater salmon with elevated plasma GH levels and inhibited growth, specific binding of sGH to liver membranes was three times lower than in normal seawater smolts. Down-regulation of hepatic GH receptors by high plasma GH levels may explain in part the low sGH binding in stunts."
