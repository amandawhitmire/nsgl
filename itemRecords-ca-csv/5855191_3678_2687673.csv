12,Abstract:,"In biological systems such as diatoms and sponges, the formation of solid silica structures with precisely controlled morphologies is directed by proteins and polysaccharides and occurs at neutral pH and ambient temperature. Laboratory methods, in contrast, rely on extreme pH conditions and/or surfactants to induce the condensation of silica precursors into specific morphologies. The recent demonstration that silicatein--a protein found in the silica spicules of the sponge ""Tethya aurantia""--can hydrolyse and condense the precursor molecule tetraethoxysila​ne to form silica structures with controlled shapes at ambient conditions shows promise for more benign synthesis methods. Here researchers describe synthetic cysteine-lysine block copolypeptides that mimic the properties of silicatein: the copolypeptides self- assemble into structured aggregates that hydrolyse tetraethoxy-​silane while simultaneously directing the formation of ordered silica morphologies. Hard silica spheres and well-defined columns of amorphous silica are produced using the fully reduced and the oxidized forms of the copolymer, respectively."
