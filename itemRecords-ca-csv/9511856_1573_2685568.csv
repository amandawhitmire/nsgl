8,Abstract:,"In the early 2000s, pelagic fish species in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE), including theendangered Delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus, experienced a sharp population decline.Coincid​ing with this collapse, there was a significant decrease in zooplankton abundance in theSFE, including the critical prey items Eurytemora affinis and Pseudodiaptomus forbesi.Scienti​sts have been unable to identify a single source of the collapse of the pelagic food web in the SFE. Rather, they believe a combination of effects, including contaminant exposure andchanges in water quality, are the cause of the pelagic organism decline. To determine arelationship between pesticide exposure and copepod survival, in chapter one I conducted aseries of acute toxicity tests with E. affinis and P. forbesi using five key pesticides (chlorpyrifos,f​ipronil, permethin, λ-cyhalothrin, and bifenthrin). The main conclusions of my first study were that E. affinis and P. forbesi are sensitive to pesticides at environmental levels, E. affinis is moresensitive to pesticides than P. forbesi, and pyrethroids were the most toxic of the pesticidesinves​tigated."
