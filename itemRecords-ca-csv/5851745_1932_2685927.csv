14,Abstract:,"Global climate change leads to local environmental impacts of sea level rise (SLR). This report describes efforts to identify vulnerable coastal populations and to develop protocols to synthesize population-â€‹environment case studies and minimize local impacts. The emphasis is on the demography of SLR, appropriate methods for demographers to study SLR, and lessons learned. The authors delineate coastal areas in the coterminous U.S. susceptible to SLR, measure SLR on sandy beach urban areas in California and Maine, assess physical impacts for human populations, assess the efficacy and stakeholder acceptability of some mitigation policies, and evaluate stakeholder responses."
