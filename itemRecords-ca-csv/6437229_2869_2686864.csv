8,Abstract:,"Cryptosporidium and Giardia are important disease agents for both humans and animals worldwide. Unlike many pathogens, their capacity for surviving in soil and water for extended periods of time enables environmental transmission. Both parasites replicate within warm-blooded vertebrate hosts and are excreted as an environmentally resistant oocyst or cyst, respectively. New hosts become infected through ingestion of oocysts or cysts in contaminated water, food, or soil. The objective of this thesis work was to utilize an epidemiologic approach to identify environmental factors associated with the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. in California coastal wetlands, as well as to ascertain the prevalence and identify potential transmission pathways within the animal community in the Virunga Massif, Rwanda."
