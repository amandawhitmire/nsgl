12,Abstract:,"This year—1993—is a banner year for Sea Grant in California. Twenty years ago, the University of California was designated a Sea Grant College. This designation symbolized a mutual recognition of continuing responsibility, both by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the University of California, to ""develop and maintain the excellence and public utility"" of the Sea Grant program. Also, in 1973,the state became a partner in the Sea Grant program with the federal government and with California's great university systems by enacting legislation to provide matching funds to California Sea Grant. That same legislation established an advisory panel, the Resources Agency Sea Grant Advisory Panel (RASGAP), to identify state needs that might be met through Sea Grant. It is as part of our accountability to the citizens of California and the nation that we offer this report covering the fiscal period 1987-1992. In it we feature a selection of program activities that emphasize Sea Grant's accomplishments​. A complete list of research projects conducted during this period appears on page 32. Three broad areas of activity lie at the core of Sea Grant: research, extension, and education."
