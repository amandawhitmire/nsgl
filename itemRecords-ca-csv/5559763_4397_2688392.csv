10,Abstract:,"As U.S. coastal states and Canadian provinces formulate approaches to development and management of adjacent ocean areas, regional considerations should play a prominent role. Drawing on evolving concepts of sea use planning, integrated marine policy, large marine ecosystem management, and exclusive economic zone governance, and on international examples of regional ocean management, this paper explores the potential for regional ocean management on the U.S. west coast. The emphasis is on legal and institutional arrangements which would support regional management on the west coast."
