13,Abstract:,"The construction of wastewater wetlands could lower anthropogenic nutrient inputs to coastal ecosystems, but the continuous discharge of freshwater may threaten the region's estuarine ecosystems. As a solution, pulsed-​discharge wastewater wetlands could be constructed upstream of natural coastal salt marshes to impound freshwater, remove nutrients and toxins, and discharge the water on outgoing tides. The objective of this study was to determine if water treatment by constructed freshwater wetlands could be improving by managing the hydroperiod, while also reducing problems of salinity dilution downstream. The relative importance of plant uptake, microbial assimilation and sediment adsorption in the removal of nutrients was assessed, and the effect of hydroperiod (three pulsed-​discharge regimes) upon N and P removal efficiency in replicate wetland mesocosms receiving synthetic wastewater was investigated."
