10,Abstract:,"Tidal salt marsh habitats are thought to play an integral role in estuarine biogeochemical cycles. The paradigm in salt marsh biogeochemistry is that marshes act as nutrient sinks and organic matter sources. However, at present few published studies exist for nutrients and phytoplankton stocks in salt marsh sloughs of the northern San Francisco Bay Estuary. Two independent research and monitoring programs were initiated to fill this information gap by providing the basis for a comparison of nutrients and phytoplankton between salt marsh habitats and adjacent main channel habitats at several locations in the northern estuary, including locations near the San Francisco Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve site at Rush Ranch. Further process-based studies are needed to constrain the exchange of nutrients and phytoplankton between salt marsh habitats and the estuary; however, this summary of available data suggests that the potential flux of nutrients and phytoplankton biomass is likely site-specific and driven by local processes."
