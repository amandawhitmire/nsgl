9,Abstract:,"The potential risk of ""Clostridium botulinum"" growth in fresh fish stored under modified atmospheres (MA) is unclear. This paper reports ongoing attempts to quantify the effect of selected parameters on the probability of toxigenesis by one spore in fish. The factorially designed experiments included fresh salmon tissue homogenate with 3 levels of initial microbial flora inoculated with a pool of spores at 7 levels and incubated at 1 to 30 deg. C under 3 MA (vacuum, 100% CO2, 70% CO2 and 30% air) for up to 60 d. Equations were derived which could estimate the length of the lag phase and the probability of toxigenesis by one spore under a particular storage condition."
