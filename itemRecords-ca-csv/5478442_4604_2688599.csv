13,Abstract:,"Ceratomyxsis is a disease of salmonid fishes caused by the myxosporean ""Ceratomyxa shasta"". The parasite has a tropism for the intestinal tissue and causes high mortalities in susceptible strains of salmonids. Clinical signs of the disease vary among salmonid species. Diagnosis requires that spores be found and identified by their size, shape, and location. Fish can become infected in water at temperatures as low as 4 to 6 deg C; however, progress of the disease is temperature-​dependent, and more infections are detected after the water warms. Only salmonids are susceptible to ""C. shasta"" infection, but susceptibility may vary within a species. ""C. shasta"" has been identified in salmonids from marine and freshwater environments in northern California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and British Columbia. The life history of the parasite is unknown. The most successful approach for control of certomyxosis in both hatchery and wild populations is the introduction of resistant salmonids."
