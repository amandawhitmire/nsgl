16,Abstract:,"Five new farnesyl-​R-​nitropyrroles, nitropyrrolins A-E (1-5), were isolated from the saline culture of the marine actinomycete strain CNQ-509. This strain belongs to the ""MAR4"" group of marine actinomycetes, which have been demonstrated to be a rich source of hybrid isoprenoid secondary metabolites. The structures of the nitropyrrolins are composed of R-nitropyrroles with functionalized farnesyl groups at the C-4 position. These compounds are the first examples of naturally occurring terpenyl-​R-​nitropyrroles. Chemical modifications, including one-step acetonide formation from an epoxide, and application of the modified Mosher method provided the full stereostructure​s and absolute configurations of these compounds. Several of the nitropyrrolins, nitropyrrolin D in particular, are cytotoxic toward HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells, but show weak to little antibacterial activity against methicillin-​resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."
