13,Abstract:,"Silicatein ""alpha"" is the principal subunit comprising about 70% of the mass of the silica protein filaments of a marine sponge. The authors of this report demonstrate that the functional hydroxy and imidazole side chains of serine- 26 and histidine-165, which were identified from the structure of silicatein ""alpha"" as its putative active site, are required for the protein's efficient and specific catalysis of alkoxysilane polycondensatio​n at neutral pH. These observations may prove useful in the design of synthetic catalysts for environmentally benign synthesis of silica and organically modified polysilsesquiox​anes."
