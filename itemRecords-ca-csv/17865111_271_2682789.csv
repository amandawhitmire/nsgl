14,Abstract:,"Along the world’s highly valued and populous coastlines, the upper intertidal zones of sandy beach ecosystems and the biodiversity that these zones support are increasingly threatened by impacts of human activities, coastal development, erosion, and climate change. The upper zones of beaches typically support invertebrateswi​th restricted distributions and dispersal,makin​g them particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. We hypothesized that disproportionat​e loss or degradation of these zones in the last century has resulted in declines of upper shore macroinvertebra​tes in southern California. We identified a suite of potentially vulnerable endemic upper beach invertebrates with direct development, low dispersal and late reproduction. Based on the availability of printed sources and museum specimens, we investigated historical changes in distribution and abundance of two intertidal isopod species (Tylos punctatus, Alloniscus perconvexus) in southern California. Populations of these isopods have been extirpated at numerous historically occupied sites: T. punctatus from 16 sites (57% decrease), and A. perconvexus from 14 sites (64% decrease). During the same period, we found evidence of only five colonization events. In addition, the northern range limit of the southern species, T. punctatus, moved south by 31 km (8% of range on California mainland) since 1971. Abundances of T. punctatus have declined on the mainland coast; only three recently sampled populations had abundances >7000 individuals m1. For A. perconvexus populations, abundances >100 individuals m1 nowappear to be limited to the northern part of the study area. Our results show that numerous local extirpations of isopod populations have resulted in regional declines and in greatly reduced population connectivity in several major littoral cells of southern California. Two of the six major littoral cells (Santa Barbara and Zuma) in the area currently support 74% of the remaining isopod populations. These isopods persist primarily on relatively remote, ungroomed, unarmored beaches with restricted vehicle access and minimal management activity. These predominantly narrow, bluff-backed beaches also support species-rich upper beach assemblages, suggesting these isopods can be useful indicators of biodiversity. The high extirpation rates of isopod populations on the southern California mainland over the last century provide a compelling example of the vulnerability of upper beach invertebrates to coastal urbanization. Climate change and sea level rise will exert further pressures on upper beach zones and biota in southern California and globally. In the absence of rapid implementation of effective conservation strategies, our results suggest many upper intertidal invertebrate species are at risk."
