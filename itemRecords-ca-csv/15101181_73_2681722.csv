12,Abstract:,"University of Southern California Sea Grant: highlights of achievements in the Urban Ocean for 1972-2015. In this 40th+ anniversary retrospective, we tell a few stories to show how USC Sea Grant's long-term work supports achievements in several key areas of importance to Southern California. It is extremely rewarding to be able to say that some things are better than they were 20 or 40 years ago. It is not possible to say that about everything, but we can see improvements here alongour coastline, and we are proud to have been part of the collaborations of research scientists, educators, government leaders and community stakeholders that worked on these issues. As always, the work is not done, and the stories told here are not finished. As the realities of climate change become morechallenging​, we must view all of our work through a new lens. Climate change will continue to affect everything from the thickness of mussel shells, to the distribution and abundance of marine populations, to the management of critical municipal resources like water, beaches, ports, and other coastline infrastructure. It is our hope that these stories of success in the Southern California urban ocean laboratory can help facilitate the protection and sustainable management of coastal and marine resources in other urban ocean settings."
