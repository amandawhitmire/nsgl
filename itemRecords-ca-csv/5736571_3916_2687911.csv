10,Abstract:,"The present set of experiments was designed to determine if white sturgeon, like rainbow trout, can increase plasma pituitary gonadotropin (GTH) levels in response to chronic testosterone treatment. Testosterone-​treated white sturgeon were also injected with a gonadotropin releasing hormone analog known to induce GTH release in mature male white sturgeon. The effects of this combined treatment on pituitary and plasma concentrations of GTHs were also evaluated."
