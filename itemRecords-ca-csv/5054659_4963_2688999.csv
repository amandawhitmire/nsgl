11,Abstract:,"A report on the University of California Sea Grant College Program for September 1, 1972, to August 31, 1973. 1972-73 has become a landmark year in the brief history of the University of California Sea Grant Program with the August announcement by Secretary of Commerce Frederick Dent that the University of California had been selected for designation as the nation's seventh Sea Grant College. This designation, according to the Office of Sea Grant, is based on quality, quantity and productivity of performance by the institution in the categories of research, education, and advisory services; the degree and nature of cooperation with and service to its marine communities; the exercise of leadership in the institution's conduct over a period of not less than three years under Institutional Support; and the efficiency and competence of its Sea Grant program management. Whi​le the direct intent of this publication is to report project work and advisory activity during the year1972-73, it is hoped that it will spark new questions with regard to other aspects of our management and utilization of marine resources that will lead to useful new investigations and services. The scientific and academic resources potentially available within the California community to meet Sea Grant objectives are almost unique in scope and quality. The task is to correctly identify public interest priorities and the personnel best equipped to deal with them. It is the continuing objective of the University of California Sea Grant program to direct our best human resources and facilities toward solution of marine resource development and management problems."
