12,Abstract:,"Little is known about how salmonids prepare to meet the high calcium and magnesium concentrations of seawater, which hormones are involved in the regulation of these ions, or what quantitative changes occur in the plasma levels of these ions prior to or after seawater entry. The main objective of this study was to observe changes in plasma calcium and magnesium levels during smoltification and seawater (SW) adaptation and to correlate these with changes in osmoregulation and levels of hormones that might participate in the regulation of the divalent ions, focusing on the possible role of calcitonin. A sharp transitory peak in plasma calcitonin levels occurred early in smoltification (March) and in SW-adapted fish in June. Plasma calcitonin levels gradually increased in FW-adapted fish during the period of desmoltificatioâ€‹n. However, no change in plasma calcitonin levels occurred during SW-induced hypercalcemia, suggesting that the hormone does not play a major role in short-term plasma calcium regulation in coho salmon."
