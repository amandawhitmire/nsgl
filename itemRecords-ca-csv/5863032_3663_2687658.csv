13,Abstract:,"This investigation was conducted in order to clarify the neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating seasonal aspects of reproduction in rockfish by comparing levels of characterized molecular forms of gonadotropin-​releasing hormone in brains and pituitaries at component stages of the annual reproductive cycle of male and female grass rockfish. Grass rockfish (""S. rastrelliger"") are nearshore representatives of the genus ""Sebastes"" and were chosen as a model because of their importance to the fishery of the eastern Pacific Rim."
