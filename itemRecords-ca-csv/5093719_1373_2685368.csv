8,Abstract:,"This report, will describe the activities of the four research projects and Marine Advisory Program which received Sea Grant support during FY 1972-1973. The objective of the Coherent Area Sea Grant Program at Humboldt State University is, as the title states, the 'Development of the Living Marine Resources of Northern California.' This clearly indicates the emphasis that has been given to support the commercial and recreational fisheries of this region. To accomplish our objective, we are attempting to involve marine users and resource persons available in our area. We believe that through this cooperative involvement, the opportunity exists to identify, and solve, relevant problems. The Sea Grant Program at Humboldt State University is coordinated by Dr. Richard L. Ridenhour who is responsible, in this capacity, to the President of the University. All financial activities are conducted in accordance with the policies of the Humboldt State University Foundation which is the actual recipient of the grant.Â Guidance to the program is provided by an Advisory Committee which includes individuals who represent the commercial fishing industry, the fish processing industry, marine-oriented recreation including fishing, the California Department of Fish and Game, the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, College of the Redwoods, and Humboldt State University. The programs submitted for funding are reviewed and supported by the Advisory Committee."
