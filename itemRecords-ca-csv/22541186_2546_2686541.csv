10,Abstract:,"The nearshore region, consisting of the surfzone (shoreline to seaward boundary of depth-limited wave breaking) and inner-shelf (surfzone boundary to ≈20 m water depth), is vitally important to coastal economies, recreation, and human and ecosystem health. Yet, despite the detriments of frequently contaminated coastal water, dynamical complexities of the surfzone/inner-​shelf interface have limited our understanding of nearshore transport and dilution. A shoreline-​source contaminant’s fate is ultimately determined by its exchange with the inner-shelf. Here, cross-shore exchange is examined with coupled surfzone/inner-​shelf observations of temperature and dye during two continuous releases at alongshore-​uniform Imperial Beach, CA. Dye is mixed and alongshore tran​sported in the surfzone while being ejected to the inner-shelf by transient rip currents (TRCs). The second release is simulated with a wave-resolving model. In situ 29 September observations reveal a vertically-​mixed surfzone that is warmer than the inner-shelf, where elevated temperature and dye co-occur in alongshore-​narrow TRC ejections and are depth-uniform in a warm upper layer. Below, stratification limits vertical dye mixing to magnitudes of ocean interiors, despite proximity to the well-mixed surfzone. A temperature-​derived bulk cross-​shore exchange velocity u ∗ T = 0.9 × 10−2 m s−1 suggests TRCs dominate the exchange. Observations from 13 October include aerial-based multispectral dye images, enabling novel surfzone/inner-​shelf tracer mass budget closure. Over 5 h and 3.25 km downstream, 1/2 the surfzone-​released dye is transported offshore to the inner-shelf. Near-shoreline dye follows power-law decay (exponent −0.33). Observed cross-shore transports are parameterized well using a bulk exchange velocity and mean surfzone/inner-​shelf dye difference. The best-fit velocity u ∗ = 1.2 × 10−2 m s−1 is similar to temperature-​derived u ∗ T from 29 September. The u ∗ magnitude, inner-shelf dye vertical structure, time- and length-scales indicate TRC dominance again during this release. The 13 October release is simulated with the wave-resolving, Boussinesq model funwaveC, which generates TRCs but does not resolve inner-shelf vertical variation. The model largely reproduces observed dye cross-shore profiles, alongshore transport, near-shoreline power-law decay, and surfzone/inner-​shelf mass budgets for 1.2 × 104 s. Thereafter, inner-shelf (surfzone) dye is somewhat overpredicted (under-​predicted), possibly due to funwaveC’s lack of tide or vertical variation. The good overall model–data agreement indicates that nearshore tracer dispersion is realistically simulated, and that the funwaveC TRCs accurately induce cross-shore surfzone/inner-​shelf exchange."
