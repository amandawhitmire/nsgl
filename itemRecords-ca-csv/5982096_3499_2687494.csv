10,Abstract:,"The authors employed a large-scale experimental rocky reef system to examine patterns of recruitment of two fishes, the California sheephead ""Semicossyphus pulcher"" and the blackeye goby ""Rhinogobiops nicholsii"". They quantified recruitment over two years on 21 experimental reefs (each 1600 sq m) that represented low, medium, and high treatments of habitat coverage. They specifically addressed four questions: (1) Does recruitment vary among reefs with different coverages of rocky-reef habitat and does the pattern remain consistent? (2) Does the abundance of recruits correspond to the abundance of older individuals in a cohort over time? (3) Does recruitment vary between the inside and edge of reefs? (4) Are there specific microhabitats that explain the distribution of recruits within reefs and at larger spatial scales?"
