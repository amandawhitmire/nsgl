8,Abstract:,"Jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas ) are an important component of the marine ecosystem and a key target of marine fisheries throughout the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), from the coast of Peru to the Gulf of California. Further north, in the California Current system (CCS), a reappearance of this species off Monterey after the 1997-98 El Niï¿½o resulted in an unusual persistence of the new population. Since 2003, jumbo squid have been regularly encountered in large numbers throughout the CCS and as far north as southeast Alaska. Likewise, jumbo squid have recently expanded the southern extent of their range from their traditional distribution along the waters off Peru to the central Chilean coast. In both hemispheres, invasions have been documented throughout the past century, as far back as the 1830s in Chile (Alarcon-Munoz et al., this volume), however the spatial and temporal extent of the ongoing invasions appear to be unprecedented in the historical record."
