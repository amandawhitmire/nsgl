11,Abstract:,"The two ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach dominate the U.S. shipping industry on the west coast. They plan massive infrastructure improvements and expansion over the next 30 years. These infrastructure changes are proposed for construction in a mature, fully developed urban area with little vacant land to accommodate such changes. This paper outlines an econometric analysis designed to model the economic impacts of such port infrastructure improvements. The ultimate strength of this modelling approach is the unlimited variety of planning issues it can address and the considerable detail it can bring to bear on those issues. Moreover, the approach is firmly grounded in long- standing theoretical principles of regional impact analysis and can therefore serve as a consistent basis of comparison of the impacts associated with alternative urban development projects under review. It also has the advantage of being able to consider the combined spatial and sectoral impacts of several projects undertaken simultaneously, with outputs readily summarized in a visual format."
