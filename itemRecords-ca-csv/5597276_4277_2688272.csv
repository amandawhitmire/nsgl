11,Abstract:,"The order Decapoda is divided into two suborders, the Pleocyemata, animals that brood their eggs, and the Dendrobranchiat​a, whose members are broadcast spawners. Members of this latter suborder, especially the Penaeoidea, represent one of the largest wild-caught and cultured fisheries in the world. The most thoroughly examined Penaeoidea is the marine shrimp, ""Sicyonia ingentis"". Extensive knowledge is available on the reproductive biology of males. Although less is known concerning the reproductive biology of the female, the reproductive cycle, postvitellogeni​c ovarian development, and egg activation have been studied. This paper reviews our knowledge of female reproductive biology in this species."
