10,Abstract:,"In 1985 only one small tuna cannery is still operating in the continental U.S. The four major U.S. firms now rely completely on canned tuna imports and offshore canning operations in Puerto Rico and American Samoa. The economic impact of such relocation and other changes in the $1.5 billion industry is the subject of this report, which is divided into chapters giving an overview of the industry; its present condition; and analyses of the recent direct, indirect and induced losses of jobs, incomes and taxes."
