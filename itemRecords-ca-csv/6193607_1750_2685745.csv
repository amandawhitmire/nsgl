9,Abstract:,"Work from Scott Creek, a small coastal watershed in central California has provided insights on the challenges faced by coastal salmonids. Based on results from both steelhead and coho salmon, it is has become clear that summer through fall seasons in these coastal watersheds can be especially challenging to fish for several reasons associated with low flow, shallow/narrow stream channels and warmer summer temperatures. Preliminary work on avian predation indicates the stream is probably at carrying capacity for predators. Age 0 juvenile densities drop off rapidly during fall months and are probably due in part to low flow, clear water with limited refuge habitat making fish more susceptible to predation. Growth has been shown to be much slower during summer and fall months in comparison to winter and spring. Seasonal studies of diet and invertebrate community composition are underway and we hypothesize that there is probably a reduction in available forage associated with shrinking stream channels. In addition, data from fish carrying temperature loggers suggest there is limited thermal refuge in these habitats and fish are potentially at the mercy of varying stream temperatures. While warmer temperatures do not typically challenge coho salmon thermal limits under the riparian canopy, the elevated metabolic rate under reduced forage potential is not an ideal combination. This contributes to an overall small coho salmon smolt size with a mean of 103 mm fork length. In comparison, the minimum smolt size threshold for marine survival of coho salmon returning to the Scott Creek watershed appears to be about 110 mm, based on scale analysis to back calculate size at ocean entry. While the Russian River is a larger system, there is presumably a greater challenge placed upon it from agricultural and urban water demands. As such, it is likely that juvenile coho salmon face similar challenges in the upper tributary rearing habitat and would benefit from off-channel habitat improvements that may serve as a source of refuge from thermal challenges and avian predation. However, the potential forage benefits and increased risks from predatory fish is beyond the scope of the above work to provide insight."
