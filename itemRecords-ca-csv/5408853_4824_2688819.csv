12,Abstract:,"Four new representatives of the rare pseudopterane skeleton are reported from the Caribbean gorgonian ""Pseudopterogor​gia kallos"". The structure of the sole crystalline metabolite, kallolide A acetate, was provided by single- crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Structures for kallolides A-C were subsequently established on the basis of spectral analyses and chemical interconversion​s. Kallolide A, the major metabolite, shows potent antiinflammator​y activity."
