10,Abstract:,"A spore-forming sulfate-​reducing bacterium ""Desulfotomacul​um reducens"" sp. nov. strain MI-1 has been isolated from heavy metal contaminated sediments. Strain MI-1 grows with Cr(VI), Mn(IV), Fe(III), and U(VI), in addition to various sulfur compounds, as electron acceptors. This organism shares physiological properties with both the sulfate-​reducing and metal-reducing groups of bacteria and is the first sulfate- reducing bacterium described that can grow with metals or U(VI) as sole electron acceptors."
