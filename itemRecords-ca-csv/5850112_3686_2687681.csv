10,Abstract:,"In this study scientists engineered chemical-​releasing collectors to examine the effects of waterborne cues on settlement rates of planktonic larvae in natural habitats. Significantly more barnacle larvae (""Balanus amphitrite"") were found to colonize collectors emitting trace amounts of the synthetic peptide analog, glycyl-​glycyl-​L-​arginine, than those emitting either seawater or an organic enrichment control. The inductive compound is similar in structure to peptide signal molecules that are naturally released by adult barnacles and oysters. The potent effects of subtle changes in seawater chemistry may thus warrant careful attention as putative agents mediating habitat colonization."
