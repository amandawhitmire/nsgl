15,Abstract:,"Hurricane Bob moved up the US east coast and crossed over southern New England and the Gulf of Maine (with peak marine winds up to 100 mph) on 19-20 August 1991, causing significant damage along the coast and shelf. A three-​dimensional fully wave-current coupled Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) system was developed and applied to simulate and examine the coastal ocean responses to Hurricane Bob, Results from process study-oriented experiments show that wave-current interaction caused a significant change of the current direction and mixing, but had relatively little contribution to the maximum sea level along the coast. Diagnostic analyses suggest that the contribution of hurricane-​derived wave-current interaction to the net water flux varies in space and time. the hurricane-​induced wave-current interaction could generate strong vertical current shear in the stratified areas, leading to strong offshore transport near the bottom and enhanced water mixing over the continental shelf. Stratification also could result in a significant difference of water currents around islands where the water is not vertically well mixed."
