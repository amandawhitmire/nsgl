11,Abstract:,"Both cortisol and growth hormone were able to reverse partially the effects of hypophysectomy on coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") as judged by improved seawater tolerance after long-term treatment; however, neither hormone significantly restored gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity. These results suggest that these hormones may be involved in the development of hypoosmoregulat​ory ability in coho salmon. However, the failure of either hormone to restore gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity suggests that a combination of these hormones and/or an additional hormone(s) acting in a synchronized fashion may be required for full effectiveness."
