10,Abstract:,"Recently, multi-variable moored systems (MVMS) have been developed to study the ecology and physics of the upper ocean; in ongoing studies described here, MVMS systems are utilized to study problems related to the discharge of wastewaters into the coastal marine environment near Los Angeles. The overall goal is to determine how particulate distributions in the vicinity of an ocean outfall change in response to physical and biological processes. These efforts include a benthic component which concerns the resuspension of bottom sediments in response to various physical forcing conditions and a water column component which involves the variability and distributions of effluent and phytoplankton (and their detrital products) particulate matter and their effects upon the subsurface light field."
