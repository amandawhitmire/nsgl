16,Abstract:,"Algal toxins (domoic acid, saxitoxin, okadaic acid) were monitored at seven locations off southern California using Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking. At least two types of toxins were found at all locations, with co- occurrence of two and three toxins in 12% and 10% of samples, respectively. This study expands our limited understanding of the simultaneous presence of multiple algal toxins along the coast and raises questions regarding the potential health ramifications of such co-occurrences."
