8,Abstract:,"Sensory systems provide critical filters that enable organisms to detect and recognize valuable resources. Trophic cascades, structuring populations and communities, are determined to a large degree by trait-mediated interactions that rely on sensory inputs. Certain molecules serve as chemosensory stimuli and play keystone roles in determining outcomes of predator-prey dynamics at multiple trophic levels. Here, a surface-​adsorbed glycoprotein signal molecule, MULTIFUNCin, is fully identified and its role in wave-swept rocky intertidal community dynamics investigated. Barnacles {Balanus glandula), are constrained to produce MULTIFUNCin for cuticle/shell formation. This compound evoked settlement by conspecifics larvae in field assays, and thus, operates as seminal cue for recruitment. Moreover, the same substances triggered predation by a numerically dominant whelk species {Acanthinucella spirata) on barnacle juveniles and adults in lab and field experiments. This glycoprotein, therefore, balances simultaneous demographic processes that enhance, and diminish, barnacle populations. As dominant competitors for space, the relative equilibrium between barnacle recruitment and predation mortality has strong, cascading direct and indirect effects on community dynamics. Hence, MULTIFUNCin plays a keystone role within rocky intertidal habitats."
