11,Abstract:,"Increased knowledge of billfish age and growth is essential for sensible management of these fisheries. Age estimation of Pacific blue marlin is still in the developmental stages and most data have focused on sagittae, with little effort on other skeletal structures. The objective of this study was to examine, interpret, and quantitatively compare growth patterns in the sagitta, vertebrae, and dorsal and anal fin spines of blue marlin from Kona, Hawaii. Each structure was evaluated in terms of ease of collection and processing, legibility of growth patterns, and the relative precision of the resulting age estimates."
