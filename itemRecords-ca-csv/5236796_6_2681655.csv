12,Abstract:,"This year's summary—in its newsmagazine format—addresse​s our need to more effectively communicate the activities and results of the California Sea Grant College Program. It is purposely unlike other summaries we've produced in the 10 years since California was awarded a Sea Grant College, reflecting the changes that have taken place in the last year in California, in the West, and in the United States. Sea Grant—in California and the 26 other states that have programs—has been contributing to the nation's economy. It has developed new and innovative scientific and engineering techniques that increase the contribution of marine resources to the economic and social well-being of the nation. It has analyzed the allocation and distribution of marine resources and marine products to aid public policy-making. It has provided scientific and technical training necessary for productive use and management of marine resources. And it has communicated the results of university research efforts to all segments of the marine community, to the public, and to governmental offices. Sea Grant funds important research and activities in many aspects of the marine sphere: coastal resources, aquaculture, fisheries, ocean technology, and marine affairs, and it provides marine advisory assistance to fishermen, industry, and government agencies that are using, developing, and protecting California's valuable marine resources. With this summary, we want the people of California to be aware of the contribution Sea Grant is making to their lives. We want state and federal agencies to realize the level of coordination and cooperation that exists between Sea Grant and the groups charged with developing and managing the nation's coastal resources. We want university officials, researchers, and specialists to know about the research Sea Grant supports at their institutions. And we want governmental officials to be informed about Sea Grant activities that contribute to wise ocean development for the state and the nation."
