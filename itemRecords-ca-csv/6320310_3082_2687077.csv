12,Abstract:,"Long before multi-million dollar NOAA Fisheries vessels were built, fisheries scientists relied on traditional or local ecological knowledge and valued the information that fishermen gathered during their daily life on the water. The information was eclectic, and included observations about a wide range of conditions and interactions of various species. Reflecting back upon these times, both fishermen and scientists have commented that the relationships between them were also very important. Later a ""great gulf"" between scientists and fishermen developed, as scientists focused more on hiring fishing vessels to use as research platforms and less on engaging and learning from fishermen to develop research ideas or test hypotheses. Over the last decade, the tide has turned again, and there is growing interest and activity in cooperative fisheries research (CFR). Some fishermen are growing increasingly comfortable with science, and more scientists have realized that there is untapped potential for mutual learning. Others have addressed the procedural considerations for effective CFR. This paper expands that work by highlighting the importance of the relationships among partners, the costs and benefits to everyone involved in CFR, and how these are actually critical factors for the establishment and achievement of sound scientific goals. Managing these relationships could be an important key to understanding how to manage data-poor fisheries."
