10,Abstract:,"Many coastal fishes use inshore nursery habitats as juveniles, but it is often difficult to define which nursery areas supply most recruits to adult populations. Here researchers tested whether trace element concentrations in otoliths can be used to identify which of two nursery habitats (bays or shallow open coast) were occupied by juvenile California halibut. They found a broad-scale difference in concentrations of Cu and Pb between bay and open coast juveniles. At a finer spatial scale, otolith concentrations of Cu and Pb differed among individual bays, and fish from the same bay could differ among years, precluding their use as markers of nursery habitat use at these scales."
