19,Abstract:,"Harmonic analysis of motor current has been used to track the speed of motors for sensorless control. Algorithms exist that track the speed of a motor given a dedicated stator current measurement, for example [1-5]. Harmonic analysis has also been applied for diagnostic detection of electro-â€‹mechanical faults such as damaged bearings and rotor eccentricity [6-17]. This paper demonstrates the utility of harmonic analysis for fault detection and diagnostics in non-intrusive monitoring applications, where multiple loads are tracked by a sensor monitoring only the aggregate utility service. An optimization routine is implemented to maintain accuracy of speed estimation while using shorter lengths of data."
