10,Abstract:,"Prior to 1973, the sablefish fishery in Monterey Bay involved only a few boats and was primarily a longline operation, but shifted to a trap fishery in that year. Since little information was available about the feasibility of using such traps, and little ecological information was available about the local population of sablefish, this baseline study was undertaken. The major objectives were to (1) determine the catch during different seasons, (2) characterize the reproductive cycles, feeding habits, and parasite fauna of sablefish, and (3) evaluate their migratory patterns through tagging studies."
