10,Abstract:,"Many groups of marine organisms, including ascidians, undergo range extensions as a consequence of rapid ship- transport between distant harbors, resulting in a rapid increase in the rate of introductions of non-indigenous species worldwide. Ascidians are sessile marine filter- feeders, hermaphroditic, and often self-â€‹fertilizing; many species are tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions, can reach sexual maturity in just a few weeks, and have a long breeding season. This paper documents the arrival of 14 non-indigenous species in southern California harbors during this century."
