6,Abstract:,"This brochure explains the value of native eelgrass meadows, the ecological problems posed by invasive dwarf eelgrass and ways to identify dwarf eelgrass from native seagrasses such as Pacific eelgrass, widgeon grass and surfgrass. Dwarf eelgrass today covers thousands of acres of rare coastal wetlands in the Pacific Northwest. It is, though, a relative newcomer to California, first discovered in 2002 in Humboldt Bay. California Department of Fish and Game and California Sea Grant Extension are working to find and rid our coast of new infestations. The danger, however, is that people will unintentionally introduce dwarf eelgrass to new locations by dispersing its seeds, which can easily mix with mud and stick to boat hulls, boots and gear. A major goal of ""Stop the Spread of Dwarf Eelgrass"" is to encourage people in shallow bays and estuaries to rinse mud and debris from boats, kayaks, canoes, boots and gear before moving to a new site. People are also encouraged to report suspected sighting of dwarf eelgrass to the contacts provided in the brochure."
