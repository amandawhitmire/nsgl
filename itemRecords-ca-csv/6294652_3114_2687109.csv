9,Abstract:,"The project reviewed in this summary was focused on development of an efficient means for comprehensively assessing the human effects of the new network of MPAs. A social impact assessment (SIA) model was used to accomplish this objective. The research team has documented pertinent social, economic, and demographic trends across the study area; the resulting information will serve as a shifting baseline against which to monitor and assess changes following establishment of the new network of reserves. Research methods involved: extensive analysis of existing fisheries data; hundreds of in-depth discussions with knowledgeable fishery participants and public officials; a series of user group mapping exercises; development of a comprehensive Geographic Information System and spatial analysis of historic and current use of the marine environment; and basic observation of commercial and recreational fisheries and other uses of the marine environment across the region."
