11,Abstract:,"Information of the occurrence and location of ocean fronts off the coast of California is not readily available to the marine community. However, these ocean features are important to fisheries and ecosystems management, environmental monitoring, weather forecasting, search and rescue operations, and for habitat mapping of pelagic fisheries. Because of the need for information on ocean fronts, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, together with NOAA/NESDIS, have collaborated on a project to produce maps of frontal occurrence on a monthly basis from 30 deg. N to 43 deg. N, and from just beyond the coast, out to 128 deg. W, using imagery from the GOES-10 geostationary satellite. A total of 48 frontal maps were produced over the four-year period from July 2000 through June 2004. This information was provided to users over the internet during the project, and now that the project is complete, the information is available as a final report from California Sea Grant."
