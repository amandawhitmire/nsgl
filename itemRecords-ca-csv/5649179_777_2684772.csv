11,Abstract:,"The Ocean Governance Study Group is a committee of nationally and internationally recognized scholars and policy advisors focusing its collective talent on creating a new approach to how we govern the ocean that looks at the ocean as a whole and not solely at its discrete parts. Topics covered in this third annual symposium ranged from developing a national strategy for sustainable development of the U.S. ocean to assessing state ocean governance issues, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the offshore oil and gas program, and reauthorization of three major laws affecting living resources--the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act. Speakers from more than 40 academic institutions and federal and state agencies participated, from the President's Council on Sustainable Development to the London School of Economics and Political Science. This volume contains summaries of some thirty papers presented at the symposium."
