12,Abstract:,"The University of California Sea Grant Extension Program engages in research and extension education to support fisheries and seafood safety and technology. The program includes the Seafood Network Information Center based in the Department of Food Science and Technology on the UC Davis campus and nine marine advisors conducting applied research and educational programs from Crescent City to San Diego. One of the world's first seafood technology network information centers, SeafoodNIC is a portal to Internet resources addressing information needs of seafood processors, inspectors, researchers, importers, and food educators in areas of seafood safety and quality. SeafoodNIC is also designed to assist the seafood industry and regulators implement Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations as required by the US Food and Drug Administration. This scientifically based regulation helps US processors and importers ensure the marketing of safe seafood in the US. Marine advisors in the extension program also work with commercial and recreational fishermen assessing fisheries and infrastructure needs and providing educational programs about the fishing industry. Applied research programs address the human dimensions of fisheries as they relate to fishing communities and resource management, socioeconomic impacts of changing fisheries management and designation of marine protected areas, fish and invertebrate fisheries, and shellfish aquaculture."
