9,Abstract:,"In October 2002, a research team set sail from San Diego, California, on the 24-day expedition ""Extreme 2002: Mission to the Abyss"". The mission was to explore the super hot hydrothermal vents nearly two miles deep on the ocean floor. This eight-page resource guide for middle and high school students is designed to serve as a brief introduction to the deep sea and hydrothermal vents, and is a companion piece to the website at http://www.ocea​n.udel.edu/extr​eme2002. A video is also available on loan from NSGL."
