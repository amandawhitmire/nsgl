23,Abstract:,"This document provides scientific guidance to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) regarding the potential impacts of climate change on California fisheries and recommendations for building resilience to buffer climatic forces. At CDFW’s request, the California Ocean Protection Council (OPC) provided funding to the Ocean Science Trust (OST) to convene an OPC Science Advisory Team (OPC-SAT) Working Group with relevant ecological, social science, and governance expertise. This guidance was prepared by OST and the OPC-SAT Working Group in partnership with CDFW, in adherence with the requirements in the OPC Staff Recommendation: ""California State Fisheries Management: Current Efforts and Future Needs."" This project was developed for consideration by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to help inform the state’s process to amend the Marine Life Management Act (MLMA) Master Plan. Products from this project have been submitted to CDFW for review and may be integrated, in full or in part, into a draft Master Plan Amendment. In addition, given the broad potential ecological, social and economic impacts from climate change, we hope the document provides useful guidance for other government agencies and departments, funders, affected individuals and communities, and non-​governmental organizations engaging in action on this issue. Additional information about the Master Plan amendment process, including key resources and opportunities for stakeholder engagement, is available at https://www.wil​dlife.ca.gov/Co​nservation/Mari​ne/Master-​Plan. Key Messages: Climate change has linked ecological, social, and economic consequences for all fisheries in California. There are existing management strategies that can make fisheries more resilient. We are already seeing the effects of climate change and taking action in some fisheries. These approaches can be leveraged and built upon to improve fisheries management in California. Collaboration with fishing communities, Tribes and Native Communities, and others can support adaptive approaches. In California, the ocean supports a diversity of marine organisms and a vibrant fishing economy. However, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are leading to a warmer ocean and more extreme climate variations. This has implications for the location and abundance of fish and invertebrates as well as the people who depend on these species for their livelihoods and wellbeing. We have seen market squid moving farther north, loss of kelp beds in Northern California, and compromised shellfish populations - which are just some of the climate-related changes in California’s oceans in recent years. To provide guidance to all who are engaged today in building resilient fish stocks and fishing communities, we have identified four possible future scenarios along with the challenges they are likely to pose to ecological systems as well as to the fishermen and communities that depend on them. We then suggest seven adaptable and responsive management strategies to prepare for impacts and opportunities as the climate changes."
