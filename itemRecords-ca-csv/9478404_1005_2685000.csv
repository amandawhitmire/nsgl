30,Abstract:,"A conceptual model of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) socio-​ecological system highlights the “social” within the socio-​ecological system and demonstrates that any particular management strategy can affect human wellbeing through at least two major pathways: through alterations in environmental conditions, which in turn affect human wellbeing, and through direct effects on human wellbeing. In addition to broad conceptualizati​ons of the coast-wide system in both natural and social terms, and discussions of relevant social science approaches and frameworks, we include 5 major indicator efforts within the CCLME. These indicators cover levels of human coastal community vulnerability, vessel- and port-level fisheries diversification trends and effects, “personal use” of fisheries as a preliminary proxy for possible subsistence practices among commercial operators, the relationship between water supply and agricultural production in Central California, and a survey of marine-oriented recreational expenditures."
