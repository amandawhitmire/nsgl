10,Abstract:,"Embryos of the American lobster, ""Homarus americanus"", are remarkably resistant to infection by the fungus ""Lagenidium callinectes"", a pathogen of many crustaceans. The surfaces of healthy lobster embryos are covered almost exclusively by a single, Gram-negative bacterium, which grows in a dense mosaic pattern. In culture, this bacterium produces a compound that completely inhibits the growth of the pathogenic fungus in-vitro at 10 mcg/mL. Large-scale fermentation, extraction, and subsequent chromatographic purification led to the identification of the antifungal substance as 4-​hydroxyphenethy​l alcohol (tyrosol), an antibiotic substance known to be produced by terrestrial fungi."
