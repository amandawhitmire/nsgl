11,Abstract:,"The purpose of the Fishing Communities Project was to provide detailed historical and current social science information on four Northern California port communities - Crescent City, Trinidad, Eureka/Fields Landing, and Noyo/Fort Bragg. In addition to profiling each community, the project also provides a regional overview that encompasses the three counties - Mendocino, Humboldt, and Del Norte - in which these communities are situated. This Regional Profile provides county-level demographic and economic information, a discussion of fishery regulations, and customized summaries of ocean commercial and recreational fishery data for the three North Coast counties and the tri-county region. The information provided here is based on the collection and integrated analysis of archival data to interpret patterns, variability and change within and across fisheries and the fishing community over time."
