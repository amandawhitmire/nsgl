10,Abstract:,"The numbers of eggs spawned, attached, and carried through to hatching were examined in three groups of captive lobsters (""Homarus americanus""). Hybrid (""H. americanus"" x ""H. gammarus"") females attached 77% of all spawned eggs. Purebred females attached either most eggs of a spawn or fewer than 10%. Unfertilized eggs could attach, but the percentage which did was low. Some wild born/lab spawned ""H. americanus"" carried portions of their clutches through until hatching; however, many purebreds and all hybrids dropped their clutches before hatching. Possible factors which cause eggs to drop prematurely are discussed."
