13,Abstract:,"This paper reports the bioactive constituents of the sponge ""Fascaplysinops​is reticulata"", collected from the Benga Lagoon of the Fiji islands. The comprehensive study involved four separate Fijian collections, and its very complex mixtures consisted of sesterterpenes, alkaloids, and alkaloid-​sesterterpene salts. Several new compounds are described."
