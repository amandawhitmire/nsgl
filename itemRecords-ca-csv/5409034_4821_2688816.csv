13,Abstract:,"The ability of various carbohydrates to prevent leakage of a small, water-soluble marker from unilamellar liposomes during freeze-drying has been investigated and compared with the ability of trehalose to prevent such leakage. While the ability of the sugars to prevent lipid mixing during freeze-drying is related to their ability to prevent leakage, more sugar is required for prevention of leakage. The mass ratio of carbohydrate: lipid is the important parameter for prevention of lipid mixing and leakage. Calorimetric results suggest that it is the ability of trehalose to prevent phase separation during drying and phase transitions during rehydration that accounts for the stabilizing effect of this carbohydrate."
