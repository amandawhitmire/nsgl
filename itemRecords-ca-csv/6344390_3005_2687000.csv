10,Abstract:,"If they are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, as recommended by its advisory committee, fast-growing genetically modified salmon will provide a safe and nutritious product similar to other farm-raised Atlantic salmon. The fish would be 95% triploid females to prevent reproduction. As an extra precaution against the risk of escaping, G.M. salmon would be grown in self-contained, land-based systems rather than in cages in open water."
