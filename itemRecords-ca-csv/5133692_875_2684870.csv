10,Abstract:,"In September 1967 the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories undertook a long range study of potential effects of Kaiser Refractories industrial effluent upon the marine environment of the Moss Landing area. This study was sup ported by a three-year contract with Kaiser Refractories, and included research input from six faculty members at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories and nearly a score of graduate students, only some of them directly supported by contract funds. These investigations followed three primary thrusts: 1. Determination of physical characteristics and dynamics of the water mass in the proposed outfall area, and assessment of bottom structure, sediments, and sediment transport characteristicsâ€‹ of the area. 2. Biological investigations of bottom fauna of the proposed outfall area, with ancillary studies of plankton, fishes, and intertidal fauna. 3. Field and laboratory studies of the impact of various dilutions of Kaiser effluent upon selected bioindicator plant and animal species."
