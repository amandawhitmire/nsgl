10,Abstract:,"A modeling system is being developed to simulate water quality and fish growth in intensive aquaculture production systems that include a variety of water treatment units for water recirculation. The purpose of this model is: (1) increase and integrate the scientific knowledge in intensive aquaculture, and (2) to make this knowledge accessible to and usable by non-experts for educational and practical purposes. The model can predict the performance of several water reuse processes and configurations while also simulating water quality, resource requirements, and production capabilities of aquaculture systems. The predictions will be useful in the design of new systems, the evaluation and selection of system components, the implementation of changes to existing system, and in the management of water quality and production schedules in existing farms."
