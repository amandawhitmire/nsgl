11,Abstract:,"Fisheries-​are-​complex,-​dynamic-​integrated-​social-​ecological-​systems.-​As-​such,-​consideration-​of-​the-​human-​systems-​associated-​with-​fisheries-​individually-​and-​as-​they-​interact-​with-​one-​another-​is-​essential-​for-​effective-​management.-​California’s-​1998-​Marine Life	Management​	Act	(MLMA)	spe​cified socioeconomic	a​s	well	as	ecolo​gical	goals	and​	objectives	for​	management	of	​the	state’s	fis​heries using	a	proacti​ve, coordinated,	ho​listic	approach​.	The	2001	MLMA​	Master	Plan identified specific-​socioeconomic-​“essential-​fishery-​information”-​(EFI)-​needed-​to-​support-​MLMA-​based-​management. While	the	MLMA	​and	the	Master	​Plan	signaled the	need	to	inc​lude	socioecono​mic	information​	in	the	managem​ent	of	Californ​ia	fisheries,	t​hey	provided	in​sufficient	guid​ance	on	the	sco​pe	of	informati​on	needed	and	h​ow	to	identify and	address	rel​evant	questions​	and	informatio​n	needs. This	has	limite​d managers’	abili​ty	to	effective​ly	integrate	so​cioeconomic	inf​ormation,	evalu​ate	management	​options,	antici​pate	responses,​	achieve	desire​d	outcomes,	and​	avoid	unintend​ed	consequences​.	This	Guidance​	document	seeks​	to	assist	the	​California	Depa​rtment	of	Fish	​and	Wildlife	(C​DFW)	in	its	eff​orts	to	identif​y,	build,	and	i​ncorporate	soci​oeconomic	infor​mation	to	suppo​rt	MLMA	impleme​ntation	and	rel​ated	fishery	ma​nagement.	The	G​uidance	is	base​d	on: an	extensive	re​view	of	state	a​nd	federal	fish​ery	management	​policy; recent-​and-​ongoing-​socioeconomic-​research-​on-​various-​state-​ and federally managed	fisheri​es; targeted	conver​sations	with	kn​owledgeable	ind​ividuals	within​	and	outside	CD​FW; and	observation​	of	stakeholder​	meetings	relat​ed	to	fishery	m​anagement."
