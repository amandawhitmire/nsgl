10,Abstract:,"This report details the results of a Sea Grant survey distributed statewide in Washington during August 2012. The survey assessed the role of coastal practitioners and elected officials in climate change adaptation, the hurdles they have encountered, and the quantity and quality of information they have on local climate change impacts. The report also identifies similarities and differences in the obstacles to climate adaptation faced by practitioners in the states of Washington, Oregon, and California. These findings will help fulfill the National Sea Grant Office’s goal of identifying the types of information that local jurisdictions need to progress from understanding climate change to adapting to it."
