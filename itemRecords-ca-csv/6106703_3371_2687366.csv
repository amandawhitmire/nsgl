14,Abstract:,"Streptococcus iniae is a major fish pathogen producing invasive infections that result in economic losses in aquaculture. Development of in vitro models of S. iniae virulence may provide insight to the pathogenesis of infection in vivo. Three S. iniae strains (K288, 94-426, and 29178) were tested for virulence in a hybrid-striped bass (HSB) model using intraperitoneal injection. S. iniae strains K288 and 94-426 caused high levels of mortality in HSB (lethal dose 2 105 CFU) while strain 29178 was avirulent even upon IP challenge with 1000-fold higher inocula. In vitro assays were developed to test for the presence of characteristics previously associated with virulence in other species of pathogenic Streptococcus in animals and humans. In vitro differences relevant to virulence were not detected for beta-hemolysin activity, sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides, or adherence and invasion of epithelial cell layers. However, in whole-blood killing assays, the pathogenic strains were resistant to blood clearance, while 29178 was cleared (P < 0.001) and more sensitive to complement (P < 0.001). The avirulent strain 29178 was most efficiently phagocytosed and was most susceptible to intracellular killing (P < 0.01) by the carp leukocyte cell line (CLC). When exposed to reactive oxygen species, strain 29178 was most susceptible. When the oxidative burst of CLC cells was inhibited, intracellular survival of 29178 was rescued fivefold, while no significant enhancement in survival of K288 or 94- 426 was detected. Our results indicate that resistance to phagocytosis, oxidative killing, and associated phagocytic clearance is a significant factor in S. iniae virulence."
