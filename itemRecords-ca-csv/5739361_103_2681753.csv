18,Abstract:,"As late as the 1960s, many believed the ocean to be an inexhaustible resource; one which, efficiently harvested, might hold the answer to world hunger. Today we know that the oceans are far from inexhaustible. Most of the world's capture fisheries are fully exploited. Some, including notable examples in California, are seriously depleted. Coastal development and polluted run-off flowing from cities and farms further endanger coastal environments. This issue looks at the efforts to better understand, protect and restore the state's magnificent marine resource, one of the most biologically productive in the world. It also looks at the Sea Grant Extension Program, on the eve of its 25th anniversary. The following papers are included in this journal: 1. Abalone aquaculture struggles for foothold in Tomales Bay.
