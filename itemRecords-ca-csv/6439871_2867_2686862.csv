10,Abstract:,"Primary sector use of marine resources has historically driven offshore planning in the United States. But the increase in number and type of uses of ocean space and resources coupled with recognized declines in the state of some resources and the ecosystems upon which they depend has led managers to contemplate and design multi-use ecosystem oriented approaches to ocean planning, with the latest driver identified as renewable energy development. Here, we provide a brief overview of five leading examples of coastal marine spatial planning (CMSP) at the state level in the U.S.: California, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island. For each state, we examine the impetus, apparatus (legislative control, stakeholder process, benefits/drawba​cks), and status to illustrate influences on and approaches to CMSP. This examination highlights the degree to which each state employs attributes deemed important to CMSP. We find that the legislative detail driving each CMSP effort varies, as does the delegation of planning authority to relevant administrative bodies. Those differences set the stage for varying benefits and challenges."
