9,Abstract:,"Historically, the fishing community has used remotely sensed products either in the form of direct Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) reception on a ship or FAX charts transmitted from land-based stations. Both these products have severe limitations within the context of near real-time support/managem​ent of an operational fishery. Moreover, relatively little use has been made of geographical information systems (GIS) technologies. GIS has the potential to overcome two long-standing problems associated with satellite-​directed fisheries: (1) the absence of information due to clouds; and (2) the general lack of support for nonpelagic fisheries. This report gives the background, motivation, and essential design elements for use of a combined remote sensing/geograp​hical information system (RS/GIS) in an operational fishery and illustrates how a combined RS/GIS approach can be used to mitigate some of the traditional limitations in satellite-​directed fisheries."
