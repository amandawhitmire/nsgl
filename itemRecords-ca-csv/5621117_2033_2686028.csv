10,Abstract:,This paper discusses developments in the assessment and requalification of offshore platforms. A four-level assessment approach is proposed that attempts to qualify platforms for service at the simplest level. These developments are illustrated with results from platform requalification experiences in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore California.
