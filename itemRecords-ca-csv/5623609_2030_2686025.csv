10,Abstract:,"Pentachlorophen​ol (PCP), an antimicrobial agent, is mainly used for the preservation of wood; it is popular because of its broad spectrum and solubility in both water and organic solvents. In the coastal waters of northern California, it is primarily introduced from wood treatment plant effluents, as well as new wood pilings and retaining walls. The goal of this investigation was to determine the disposition and biotransformati​on of PCP in juvenile striped bass, an anadromous species whose developing juveniles traverse coastal waters. The objectives were to measure the bioconcentratio​n, tissue disposition, and depuration of PCP in striped bass using 24-hr exposure and recovery periods; and to identify and quantify depurated metabolites by reverse-phase high- pressure liquid chromatography."
