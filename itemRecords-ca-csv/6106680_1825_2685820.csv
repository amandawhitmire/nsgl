10,Abstract:,"We develop a simple game-theoretic model to explain the production decisions of firms when the production of a marketed good is complementary with the output of an associated good for which no market is available. The output of both goods is regulated by exogenously determined common pool output quotas which are enforced by a regulator who monitors industry output and then ceases production when either of the quotas is met. This scenario matches that of many fisheries around the world in which regulators attempt to simultaneously manage harvests of targeted species and incidentally caught bycatch of other species through common pool quotas and seasonal closures. In a first-best equilibrium we find that the intensity of individual harvest, and thus the bycatch rate, should optimally fall with increasing participation in the fishery, allowing for more orderly and less costly joint harvest throughout the full season. In contrast, under a common pool regulated equilibrium, individual fishermen fail to fully account for the external effects of their harvest decisions on the season length, leading to excessive discards, drastically shortened seasons, and large shares of un-harvested quota for all but the smallest of fishery sizes. These results are robust for even very efficient (low-bycatch) fishing gears. We examine the sensitivity of our predictions to changes in output prices, discard costs, quota allocations and differing degrees of spatial correlation of target and bycatch species. Finally, we derive the optimal bycatch penalty function and describe its significance in light of various policy alternatives available to regulators."
