17,Abstract:,"This 2006 Coastal Effects Study was a collaborative effort among SCCWRP, major southern California municipal wastewater agencies, and universities. This study was designed to investigate the impacts of CECs from ocean wastewater discharges on fish in the SCB. Samples of effluent, ocean water, sediment, and fish were collected from multiple locations and analyzed to address six key questions:  What types of CECs are discharged into the SCB from municipal wastewater outfalls?  Are SCB marine life exposed to CECs from municipal wastewater discharges?  Is there evidence of endocrine disruption or other physiological effects in SCB fish?  Are effects on fish related to historical contaminants or current municipal wastewater discharges?  Are specific chemicals responsible for the effects?  Are the physiological effects adversely impacting fish populations or communities? Effects analyses focused on the hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis), a species of flatfish associated with bottom sediments throughout the SCB. Four sites located near the largest ocean discharges of municipal wastewater were studied, in addition to a reference site. Effluent, water, sediment, and fish tissue samples were analyzed for a diverse suite of CECs, including PPCPs, hormones, and ICCs. Fish biological analyses included molecular indicators (e.g., gene expression and hormones), measures of reproductive condition, sexual maturity, and abundance. Trawl caught fish monitoring data were used to assess the health of fish communities near the outfalls as well as the reference area."
