14,Abstract:,"Some aspects of the Pacific angel shark's life history have been well studied, including its distribution and abundance, feeding habits and reproduction. However, age and growth studies have been hampered by the lack of valid annual growth zones in the vertebrae. This paper uses the available tag-recapture data and limited laboratory growth information as the only possible means of estimating age and growth of the Pacific angel shark since age- length data are not available. Once a reasonable von Bertalanffy growth function has been determined, growth can be combined with estimates of natural mortality and fecundity to demographically analyze the California population of the Pacific angel shark. This may prove to be the only possible way to model this population relative to the fishery that has developed for this species and that may already have deleteriously affected it."
