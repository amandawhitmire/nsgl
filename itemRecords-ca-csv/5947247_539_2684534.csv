9,Abstract:,"Fishery agencies encouraged urchin fishing in the early 1970s in California and the fishery peaked in the 1980s. The author of this paper presents a concise description of the ecology of the red sea urchin ""Strongylocentrâ€‹otus franciscanus"" and the California coastal environment. A summary of the fishery, its management, and current status follows, plus a discussion of future management strategies."
