16,Abstract:,"In this atlas, the authors present the first map-based status assessment of seven species of Pacific salmon at one consistent scale, under one authorship. From this starting point, this book provides a benchmark from which to study trends across time at an ecosystem-wide North Pacific scale that may have been missed at a finer resolution."
