10,Abstract:,"Reliable techniques for elucidating vertebral band pairs have been developed and evaluated for aging elasmobranchs. Preliminary evidence on Pacific angel shark growth, however, suggested that they may not deposit annual band pairs. Results of this study showed that bands were not deposited annually but were related to somatic growth. This hypothesis is supported by the number of bands in embryos and newborn Pacific angel sharks, growth of girth, and vertebral centrum dimensions, laboratory grow-out studies of tetracycline-​injected sharks, and evidence from six tetracycline-​injected tag returns."
