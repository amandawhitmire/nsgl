10,Abstract:,"Researchers measured the effects of exercise conditioning at different velocities on their energy reserves and on their physiological responses when swimming over a long period of simulated tidal current followed by a short period of simulated burst swimming (as in predatory activity or escape response), in an effort to determine whether exercise conditioning would increase energy reserves as well as improve physiological responses to swimming stress in young-​of-​the-​year striped bass. Overall, exercise conditioning in the moderate to fast velocity range increased body lipids and decreased post-swimming stress acidosis in YOY striped bass."
