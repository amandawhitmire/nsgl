13,Abstract:,"The West Coast Ballast Outreach Project's biannual newsletter provides the latest information on ballast water treatment technologies, management strategies, and west coast AIS issues. The newsletter is the first of its kind to focus mainly on ballast management issues. Since this newsletter contains articles written from environmental groups, the maritime industry, regulators, researchers, and project staff, it allows our readers to view these issues from the various perspectives. The newsletter will continue to provide updates on developments in state, federal, and international regulations. Volume 8: This issue includes articles on a variety of topics (from treatment technologies to Quagga mussels) and from a wide geographic range (New Zealand to Michigan and beyond). While editing the articles for this issue, however, I observed several recurring themes running through many of them: a plethora of jargon and acronyms; the difficulties associated with taxonomy and species identification; and the emerging recognition of commercial vessel fouling as an important aquatic invasive species (AIS) vector. These themes seem not to be unique to Ballast Exchange, but to reflect trends in the larger AIS and ballast world."
