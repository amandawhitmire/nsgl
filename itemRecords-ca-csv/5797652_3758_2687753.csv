12,Abstract:,"Marine invertebrates are sources of a diverse array of bioactive metabolites with great potential for development as drugs and research tools. In many cases, microorganisms are known or suspected to be the biosynthetic source of marine invertebrate natural products. Microbial symbioses have been described from most phyla of marine invertebrates: Porifera, Cnidaria, Bryozoa, Mollusca, Pogonophora, Echinodermata, Urochordata and Crustacea. Symbionts include bacteria, archaea and unicellular eukaryotes such as dinoflagellatesâ€‹. Interesting natural products have been found particularly in sponges, ascidians, cnidarians, bryozoans, and nudibranchs. This article describes examples of both simple and complex symbiotic systems, focusing on bryozoans and sponges."
