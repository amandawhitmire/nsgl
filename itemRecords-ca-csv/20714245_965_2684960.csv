14,Abstract:,"The California Current System is characterized by strong coastal upwelling thatdrives high primary production with implications for life in the plankton. We investigated the roleof environmental variability at local, regional, and basin-wide scales in determining decapod larvaldistribut​ions across space and time over 8 yr (2004 to 2011). We focused on an area of the CaliforniaCurre​nt off the coast of central California, USA, characterized by a strong upwelling jet, aretentive zone with high primary production, a buoyant bay outflow plume, and proximity to bothopen coast and bay habitats. While multiyear studies of holoplankton distributions have revealedstrong effects of basin-scale environmental variability, we did not find that basin-scale environmentalch​anges resulted in major shifts in meroplankton distributions. Instead, meroplankton distributionsin the California Current remained consistent across years—the oceanographic environmentaffe​cted meroplankton distributions along complex shoreline topography but not acrossthe shelf. Chlorophyll fluorescence and variables associated with regional upwelling were mostcorrelated with larval distributions, indicating an association between larval distributions and primaryproducti​on. We also found that environmental variability did not explain much of the variabilityin the larval distributions (only 5 to 20%), indicating that larval behaviors and demographicvari​ables mediated the role of physical forcing in determining larval distributions. Larval distributionspr​ovide us with clues to determine larval transport and survival, adding to our understandingof how marine populations are connected, identifying threats to their persistence, and informingeffect​ive marine conservation and resource management planning."
