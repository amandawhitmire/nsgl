14,Abstract:,"Submersible belt-transect surveys along a rocky bottom were combined with acoustic surveys of the water column to estimate depth distribution and density of fishes at Stonewall Bank, Oregon, in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The objectives of the study were to determine the porportion of fish in the water column that were not detected by submersible survey techniques and to compare estimates of fish density near the bottom from submersible surveys with density estimates from hydroacoustic surveys. Submersible surveys provided estimates of fish density near the bottom and provided valuable ground-truth for acoustic equipment. Hydroacoustic surveys provided estimates of fish density in the portions of the water column not observed on submersible transects and provided additional information on the vertical and horizontal distribution of fishes. The combined use of submersible and acoustic sampling techniques provided a better understanding of how fish use rocky banks that did either technique alone."
