10,Abstract:,"Like most other crustaceans, lobsters (""Homarus americanus"") increase their body size by molting. This cyclic event, which is repeated throughout the life of many crustaceans, is under the control of ecdysteroids (molting hormones). In lobsters, as in many other crustaceans, the ecdysteroid level rises during early premolt and reaches its peak at late stage D2, or early D3, then drops to a low level immediately before ecdysis. In this study, precise staging criteria were developed for stage D3 lobsters. The time of ecdysis during the last three days of the molt cycle could be predicted on the basis of these criteria. In addition, the effect of injecting 20-â€‹hydroxyecdysone on the rate of cuticle digestion and the time of ecdysis was investigated."
