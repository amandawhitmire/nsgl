16,Abstract:,"The Golgi complex plays a central role in the intracellular sorting and transport of proteins. Researchers here report a novel natural metabolite, ilimaquinone, from sea sponges that causes Golgi membranes to break down completely in vivo into small vesicular structures (called vesiculated Golgi membranes [VGMs]). Under these conditions, transport of newly synthesized proteins from endoplasmic reticulum to the cis-​Golgi-​derived VGMs is unaffected; however, further transport along the secretory pathway is blocked. Upon removal of the drug, VGMs reassemble rapidly into a Golgi complex, and protein transport is restored."
