9,Abstract:,"After extrusion and fertilization, lobster eggs continue to move along the female lobster's ventral surface to the pleopods, where they become attached to the ovigerous setae by means of an attachment stalk (also called a funiculus). The origin of the attachment stalk is examined here, along with the mechanism used to secure the attachment stalk to the ovigerous setae. Results show that the attachment stalk is continuous with the outer egg coat. A portion of this coat becomes deflected off the egg's surface during spawning to form an attenuated stalk which wraps around the ovigerous setae. This stalk condenses to form a tough, durable material capable of anchoring eggs to the ovigerous setae for up to 16 months."
