9,Abstract:,"Ecological communities are structured by a combination of abiotic conditions including physical habitat, and biotic interactions between the species in an ecosystem. This structuring occurs in two stages. The extent of habitat and resources used by a species is first defined by the threshold abiotic conditions a species may tolerate-the fundamental niche, and then is further limited by interspecific interactions to habitats and resources a species is well-adapted to use relative to other members of the community-the realized niche. For stream-rearing salmonids, a group of closely-related fishes with a circumpolar native distribution in freshwater habitats of the northern hemisphere, structuring of ecological communities is typically determined by the available regional species pool and the habitat requirements of individual species. Species then employ niche partitioning mechanisms which may reduce negative ecological interactions such as competition and interspecific hybridization. In coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest from northern California to southeast Alaska, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), coastal cutthroat trout (O. clarkii clarkii), and steelhead (anadromous rainbow trout-O. mykiss) are the most common group of native, stream-rearing salmonids. Similarities between species result in substantial overlap in physical habitat and biotic resource use. The extent of habitat and resource partitioning between species is likely to affect competition, which may occur between all three species, and interspecific hybridization, which occurs between coastal cutthroat and steelhead, although these processes are not well understood. This thesis consists of two chapters which examine how abiotic and biotic factors affect the ecology of coastal cutthroat trout and their interactions with steelhead and coho salmon. The first chapter examined the extent of spawning habitat segregation between cutthroat trout and steelhead, and its potential for limiting hybridization between the two species. This project used spatially explicit and continuous sampling of trout populations throughout a watershed in conjunction with molecular genetics to improve upon previous research, much of which has been limited by spatial scale or inability to accurately differentiate between steelhead, cutthroat and hybrids. Results of this project increase knowledge of the mechanisms allowing for continued species integrity in coastal cutthroat and steelhead, despite the viability of hybrids. The second chapter employed mark-recapture techniques to study cutthroat trout ecology during rapid colonization and population growth of sympatric coho salmon, re-colonizing part of their native range after a century of exclusion. The influence of physical habitat quality, temporal environmental variation, and coho salmon density were tested as potential factors explaining variability in cutthroat trout growth, movement and survival. The results of this chapter improve understanding of the relative importance of density-​dependent and density-​independent factors in regulating trout populations. Results are of use for resource managers contemplating the effects of migration barrier removal and restoration of native salmon populations on extant resident species."
