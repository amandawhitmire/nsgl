14,Abstract:,"As part of a continuing research program on the isolation of novel bioactive metabolites from marine sea fans and whips (Cnidaria, Octocorallia), an interesting sesquiterpene acid was found in several gorgonians from two regions of the western Pacific Ocean. The structure of the subergorgic acid, a cardiotoxic sesquiterpene with a new tricycloundecan​e (angular triquinane) skeleton, has been determined by combined spectral, chemical and x-ray crystallographi​c methods."
