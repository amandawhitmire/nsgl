14,Abstract:,"California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher) are a protogynous, sequential hermaphrodite that ranges from Monterey, California to southern Baja, Mexico including the Channel Islands of California. For the last 30 years, sheephead landings in California have increased considerably. Although protogyny is not unique among teleosts, it is not common in commercially valuable species and there is recent concern for the sustainability of the sheephead stock. Sheephead were arbitrarily collected from seven of the Channel Islands (Santa Catalina, San Clemente, Santa Barbara, San Nicolas, Anacapa, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa) during the breeding season from mid‐June through mid‐Septe​mber, 2007. Most fish were taken from unrestricted fishing areas; however, a small sub‐sampl​e of fish was collected from no‐take marine reserves at three of the islands (Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara and Anacapa Islands). To account for differences in length‐fr​equency, size frequency and sex ratio at the population level and to develop a metric that could be used to assess the reproductive potential of populations relative to each other, fecundity per total biomass was determined for each island. Fecundity per biomass values ranged from 36 eggs/g to 299 eggs/g, and averaged 305 eggs/g in the reserves. Santa Catalina, San Clemente and San Nicolas Islands had the lowest reproductive capacity with 36, 45 and 107 eggs/g, respectively. Sex ratios were also compared across populations, with Santa Catalina, San Clemente and San Nicolas Islands having the lowest (F:M; 0.61, 0.92, and 1.21, respectively) and Santa Cruz Island with the highest (16). The pooled sex ratio in the reserves was 6.25. These findings indicate that parameters of sheephead reproductive biology vary across the Channel Islands. The extremely low fecundity per biomass values observed in some"
