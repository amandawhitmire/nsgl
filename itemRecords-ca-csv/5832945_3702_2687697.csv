10,Abstract:,"A protein with a mass of 18.5 kDa and expressing phospholipase A2 activity was purified from the granular amebocyte of the horseshoe crab, ""Limulus polyphemus"". A partial sequence of this protein demonstrated total sequence homology with an 18.5 kDa protein with cell aggregating properties from ""Limulus"" reported previously. Here, the ""Limulus"" protein demonstrated a positive cross- reaction to polyclonal anti-human recombinant phospholipase A2. All enzymatic activity was lost after boiling in the presence of the reducing agent betamercaptoethâ€‹anol. The protein was inhibited by manoalide in a dose-dependent fashion. The protein displayed no activity in a triglyceride lipase assay. These studies characterize an alernative phospholipase A2 activity for the previously described 18.5 kDa protein from the ""L. polyphemus"" amebocyte."
