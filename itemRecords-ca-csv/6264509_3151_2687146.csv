13,Abstract:,"Feed constitutes 60-80% of production costs of tilapia. Therefore, strategies that reduce the amount of feed consumed without negatively impacting growth of fish can enhance production efficiency of tilapia farming. Previous pond studies in the Philippines show that 1) delayed onset of supplemental feeding by either 45-days or 75-days in fertilized ponds, 2) feeding at a sub-satiation level of 67%, or 3) feeding on alternate days saves on feed cost without significantly reducing production of Nile tilapia in growout ponds. We examined the utility of combined feeding delay and reduction as an additional feeding option for tilapia farmers to reduce costs. On farm trials with six cooperators evaluated the effects of standard 100% daily feeding (Treatment I) versus a feeding regimen consisting of 60 days delayed feeding, 30 days alternate-day feeding and then 30 days full feeding on a daily basis but at a sub-satiation level of 67% (Treatment II). Each farmer-​cooperator provided one pond each for the standard and reduced feeding regimen. Twelve (12) ponds in Central Luzon, Philippines ranging from 586 - 1,280 sq m were stocked with sex-reversed Nile tilapia fingerlings of the GIFT strain at 4 fish m-2. Fingerlings were stocked at the same initial weight (0.35 g) and similar initial lengths (0.10 and 0.11 cm for Treatments I and II, respectively). Following four months of culture, fish under the reduced feeding strategy had an average final body weight of 118.05 13.91 g (mean standard deviation), total length of 17.1 1.08 cm, specific growth rates (SGR) of 4.86 0.12 %, feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 2.4 0.83 and mean survival rate of 32.1 23.50 %. Control fish under a standard feeding protocol obtained a mean final body weight of 149.82 33.14 g, total length of 18.6 1.50 cm, SGR of 5.04 0.17 %, FCR of 2.7 1.10 and survival rate of 47.9 22.32 %. Except for survivorship, there were no significant differences in parameters between the control group and the group raised under the combined delayed and reduced feeding strategy. The total amount of feed consumed was ~55% less in fish under the reduced feeding strategy than fish fed at typical levels. Collectively, these results suggest that a combination of delayed and reduced feeding ration has the potential to reduce production costs through lower feed consumption without significantly altering fish growth in pond raised tilapia."
