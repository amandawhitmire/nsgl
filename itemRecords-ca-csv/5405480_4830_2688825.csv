9,Abstract:,"""Calanus pacificus"" females were collected off the California coast. A video system was used to observe and record the behavior of restrained individual female copepods presented with a variety of dinoflagellate prey. Two species, ""Gonyaulax grindleyi"" and ""Ptychodiscus brevis"", elicited acute physiological reactions. In 40% of the trials, copepods fed ""G. grindleyi"" regurgitated after 45 to 120 min and, in nearly all cases, did not maintain full guts. Copepods in the presence of ""P. brevis"" exhibited rapid heart rate and loss of motor control. ""Scrippsiella trochoidea"" elicited an intermediate response by ""C. pacificus"". Placing the copepods in ""Gyrodinium resplendens"" (used as control) suspension restored normal feeding behavior in all cases."
