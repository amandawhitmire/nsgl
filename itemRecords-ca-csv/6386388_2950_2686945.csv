9,Abstract:,"The processed seafood industry was the first US commodity to comply with a federally mandated Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation that was passed on December 18, 1995, and implemented after a 2-year grace period as of December 18, 1997. This chapter gives an overview on how to address the requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) seafood HACCP regulation, ""Procedures for the Safe and Sanitary Processing and Importing of Fish and fishery Products,"" (21CFR123; USFDA, 1995) that is introduced in Chapter 27. This chapter introduces information and resources to explain and implement the seafood HACCP regulation that is based on a system of preventive controls for food safety. The seafood HACCP regulation applies equally to US processors and foreign processors that ship their products to the US large and small firms are required to follow the seafood HACCP regulation. The seafood HACCP regulations supplement other regulations enforced by the USFDA, including the low-acid canned food regulations (USFDA, 1999)."
