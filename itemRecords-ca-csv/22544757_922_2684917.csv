15,Abstract:,"Non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of predators on their prey can be an important in -fluence on ecosystems because predators can suppress the ecological roles of far more prey thanthey can consume. However, responses to predatory risk cues can differ among species with similarecologic​al functions. We tested for NCEs on grazing and movement behaviors of 2 species ofsea urchins that have the potential to affect coral−algal interactions on Caribbean coral reefs: thesmall-bodied reef urchin Echinometra viridis and the larger, longer-spined sea urchin Diademaantillar​um. We found that cues from a generalist predator, the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirusargus, strongly suppressed grazing by D. antillarum but not E. viridis. Conversely, cues from simulatedpredat​ion, created by crushing conspecific urchins, caused reduced grazing by E. viridisbut not D. antillarum. In field tests for NCEs on movement behavior, E. viridis consistently movedaway from lobsters on coral colonies of a variety of structural complexity levels, but movementrates were reduced in response to lobster cues only when on highly rugose corals. D. antillarummovem​ent was not affected by the presence of lobsters. The contrasting responses exhibited bythese 2 urchins suggest that prey respond in unexpected ways to changes in predators and habitatcomplexi​ty. Different foraging strategies and the degree to which each species recognizes thispredator as a potential threat appear to be the primary influences observed here. Understandingth​e non-consumptive effects of predators on invertebrate reef herbivores is vital because of theirimportant roles as bioeroders and grazers on Caribbean coral reefs."
