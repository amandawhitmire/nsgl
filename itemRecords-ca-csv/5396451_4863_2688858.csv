9,Abstract:,"From the data presented in this article the following conclusions have been made: (1) the quality of the purified proteins used for this study could not be solely attributed to their amino acid composition; (2) wet weight was a poor predictor of growth, especially for short-term studies; (3) shrimp protein has been shown to be an excellent protein source and resulted in both acceptable growth and survival when compared to a diet that uses live ""Artemia""; (4) lobsters may be able to utilize diets with protein levels below 20% if they are provided with a protein that has good digestibility and good quality as defined by lobster growth studies."
