9,Abstract:,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has inspection authority over imported seafood. Prior to the March 11 earthquake in Japan, scarce information was available on radionuclide contamination. Now, the FDA home page (http://www. fda.gov) includes Radiation Safety1 information targeted at food products imported from Japan. FDA does an excellent job of summarizing frequently asked questions and answers regarding FDA activities on screening and testing results, and seafood safety issues related to radiation concerns. Below are excerpted fish and seafood discussions from Radiation Safety."
