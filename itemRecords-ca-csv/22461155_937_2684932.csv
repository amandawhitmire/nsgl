13,Abstract:,"Low inflow estuaries (LIEs) are prevalent along coastal regions with Mediterranean climates such as in Southern California where LIEs are common. LIEs are subject to large morphodynamic changes on relatively short time scales due to hydrodynamic forces driving sediment accretion and scouring. The modified bathymetry alters the circulation patterns. Los Peñasquitos Lagoon in San Diego County, CA is an example of a small, shallow LIE that experiences modified hydrodynamics due to sediment transport. Field observations are used to examine the hypothesis that wind and wave driven currents caused the lagoon's main channel to close between December 11th and 12th 2014 leading to a build up of relatively stagnant water behind the newly formed sand bar."
