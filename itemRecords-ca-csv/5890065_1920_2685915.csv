11,Abstract:,"Dissolved signal molecules that cause sperm to orient and accelerate toward an egg could play pivotal roles in fertilization success, but such compounds are largely undescribed. This investigation considered the behavioral responses of red abalone (""Haliotis rufescens"") sperm to soluble factors released into sea water by conspecific eggs. Bioassay-guided fractionation was employed to isolate a chemoattractantâ€‹, identified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as L-tryptophan."
