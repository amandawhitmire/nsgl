11,Abstract:,"In non-arthropodan invertebrates, ecdysteroids are thought to be involved in several processes. In this study, ecdysteroids in non-​reproductive, reproductive, and post-​reproductive specimens of two nemerteans, ""Paranemertes peregrina"" and ""Pantinonemerte​s californiensis""​, were studied. Ecdysteriod concentrations increased during the reproductive season in females of both species. These data suggest the possibility that ecdysteroids are involved in reproduction."
