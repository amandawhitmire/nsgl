9,Abstract:,Sufficient data have been published to permit a review of aspects of the comparative endocrinology of molting and reproduction in two important arthropod groups--the Insects and the Crustacea. An exhaustive review of this subject for insects and crustaceans is obviously beyond the scope of this series; the goal here is to discuss aspects of the commonality (and differences) between the two groups.
