12,Abstract:,"A total of 73 surface and near-surface sediment samples from the continental shelf off Oregon and northernmost California was analyzed for their elemental content using instrumental neutron activation analysis INAA!. The elements chromium and titanium were the most abundant economic metals of the 26 elements analyzed in the opaque mineral phase of the heavy-mineral assemblage of the sand fraction. Chromium, which is found mainly south of Coos Bay, Oregon, and into northern California, ranges in concentration from a trace up to 7% by weight across the middle and inner shelf. Titanium is present in large quantities to 23%! on the inner shelf from Tillamook to Cape Bianco. Both elements are present in abundance in the vicinity of Cape Blanco. Introduction: Previous geological studies of the Oregon coastal region have identified several areas where strategic and economic heavy minerals (chromium-​bearing chromite, titanium-​bearing ilmenite, and zircon) and metal (gold) placer deposits occur in substantial quantities in modern beach and ancient uplifted marine terrace deposits. Previous investigations off southern Oregon strongly suggest that placer deposits occur on the shelf and that they may contain the same minerals and metals found in the adjacent coastal region. This study was conducted to determine if economic mineral phases occur within the surficial shelf sediments off Oregon and northern California."
