19,Abstract:,"Specific evidence of coastal contamination of the marine ecosystem with the zoonotic protozoan parasite, ""Toxoplasma gondii,"" and extensive infection of southern sea otters (""Enhydra lutris nereis"") along the California coast was documented by this study. To investigate the extent of exposure and factors contributing to the apparent emergence of ""T. gondii"" in southern sea otters, the authors analyzed demographic and serological data from 223 live and dead sea otters along with additional coastal environmental data, including location and volumes of river and stream runoff, municipal sewage outfall and human coastal population density."
