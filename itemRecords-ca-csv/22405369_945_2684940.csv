6,Abstract:,"For more than a decade, California Sea Grant’s Russian River Salmon and Steelhead Monitoring Program at the University of California has been monitoring salmon and steelhead populations within the watershed to provide science-based information to everyone involved in the recovery of these critical native species. Our program supports the Russian River Coho Salmon Captive Broodstock Program, the statewide Coastal Monitoring Program, the Russian River Coho Water Resources Partnership, and other recovery efforts throughout the watershed. This update provides an overview of our seasonal monitoring efforts. Complete reports for all monitoring seasons are available at: caseagrant.ucsd​.edu/coho-​reports"
