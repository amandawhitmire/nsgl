11,Abstract:,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles freeze-dried in the presence of trehalose retain most of their original biological activity for short periods. When the dry vesicles are stored for longer periods in air, Ca2+ transport becomes uncoupled from ATPase activity within a few days. However, when they are stored under vacuum, ATPase activity, Ca2+ transport, and coupling between Ca2+ transport and ATP utilization are maintained essentially intact for at least 110 days."
