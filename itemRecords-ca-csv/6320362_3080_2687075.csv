13,Abstract:,"Fisheries management is a complex undertaking and the management of fisheries that are information limited is doubly so. Using two fisheries case studies from the west coast of the United States, the application of a structured Bayesian-based multi-criteria assessment (MCA) to data-deficient fisheries management issues is demonstrated. Managing the bycatch of yelloweye rockfish and minimizing the impact of commercial fishing on essential fish habitat requires fishery managers and stakeholders to evaluate and choose between management strategies that have different biological, social and environmental outcomes. A deficiency of biological, social and economic information to support such evaluations means the role of uncertainty must also be addressed in the decision-making process. The case studies show the major benefits of the Bayesian-based MCA to be the ability to: 1) Integrate biological, social and economic information measured in incommensurate units; 2) engage managers and stakeholders in the decision process increasing the probability of stakeholder buy-in for the decisions made; and 3) explicitly take into account uncertainty when evaluating alternative management strategies. Adoption of a structured MCA by fisheries managers improves decision making in data-poor fisheries by making the selection of management strategies analytically robust, inclusive and transparent."
