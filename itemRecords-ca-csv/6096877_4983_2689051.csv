11,Abstract:,"California Sea Grant College Program, the largest of these 30 programs, draws on the talents of scientists and engineers at public and private universities throughout the state. It is administered by the University of California and is based at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. California Sea Grant contributes to the growing body of knowledge about coastal and marine resources and helps solve contemporary marine-related problems through its sponsored research. It supports graduate education by funding trainees who work with marine scientists and engineers on a diversity of subject areas. Through its outreach and communications components, developments in information and technology are transferred to stakeholders. Our Extension personnel, in partnership with UC Cooperative Extension (UCCE), play a major role in the link between university, industry, and the public. The research funded is selected on the basis of competitive, peer-reviewed proposals and addresses a wide range of problems and opportunities. This Program Directory provides summaries of the projects being funded in 2007 by California Sea Grant. Further information on any of these projects is available by contacting our offices, or visiting the program Web site?http://www​.csgc.ucsd.edu.​"
