12,Abstract:,"Seabirds are a highly visible component of the Kermadec region's marine environment; they are also an important top-order predator. This paper discusses the occurrence and foraging behaviour of seabirds that breed on the Kermadec Islands and those that visit the region. Six of the 14 resident seabirds are pelagic feeders that forage over a large area (<1,000 km) during the breeding season, while other residents capture a large proportion of their food in waters immediately surrounding the islands."
