10,Abstract:,"The role of stress proteins of the HSP70 family in intra- and interspecific competition for space was examined in two sessile Pacific cnidarians, ""Anthopleura elegantissima"", an intertidal anemone, and ""Corynactis californica"", a subtidal corallimorphariâ€‹an. The authors tested two main hypotheses: first, that stress produced by space competition can induce HSP expression to counter the effects of aggressive neighbors; second, that HSP expression can provide a quantitative assay for space competition in sessile invertebrates."
