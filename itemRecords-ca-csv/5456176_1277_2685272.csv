8,Abstract:,"The salt marshes of America have all been disturbed, directly through effects of dredging and filling, or indirectly from hydrological modifications elsewhere in the watershed. Nowhere in the U.S. have these impacts been felt more rapidly and extensively than in southern California. In some coastal embayments, no traces of salt marsh remain; for the region as a whole, only about 25% of the coastal wetland area is left. The impact has been to endanger wetland-​dependent species with extinction. This chapter explores a broad range of guidelines that have developed from long-term research on wetlands, from observing restoration failures, and from literature review. The restoration literature includes many wetland projects from the eastern U.S., while many California salt marsh examples are evaluated here for the first time. Recommendations for goal definition, hydrological planning, experimentation​, and assessment of success are provided. The concept of `ecotechnology' is developed as the careful manipulation of habitats to achieve desired ecosystem characteristics​."
