8,Abstract:,"In 1856 and 1857, Texas gained some unlikely immigrants, 75 camels from the Middle East. In 1848 after the Treaty of Guadalupe, the U.S. gained land spanning from New Mexico to California. At the time there were no roads or trains, so Jefferson Davis proposed to use the camels as pack animals to explore the area. The camels helped to survey what is now known as Route 66."
