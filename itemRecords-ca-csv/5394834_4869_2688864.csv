9,Abstract:,"In this study, a reproducible and rapid assay to detect thresholds of photosynthetic tolerance to dehydration and temperature extremes is introduced. Current hypotheses on stress responses in several species occurring in various intertidal and latitudinal ranges are tested by comparing physiological tolerances with distributions for algal species."
