12,Abstract:,"The bright red sponge ""Haliclona"" sp. from Palau was selected for study because it overgrows and kills corals and because initial screening of crude extracts of the sponge indicated significant antimicrobial activity, particularly against ""Candida albicans"". Analysis revealed haliclonadiamin​e as the major antimicrobial alkaloid, together with papuamine. The structure of haliclonadiamin​e was determined by X-ray analysis."
