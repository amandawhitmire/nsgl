9,Abstract:,"The production of antimicrobial agents from single cultures of marine organisms has traditionally been shown to occur in stationary phase growth, i.e. when nutrients are scarce and cell populations reach a steady state. In this study, the authors screen for antibiotic activity in cultures containing two simultaneously growing organisms, mimicking the competition for space and nutrients in bacterial communities that reside in biofilms on the surfaces of marine seaweed and algae. Of particular interest are those marine bacteria that show no activity when cultured singly and induced antibiotic activity when cultured in the presence of a competitor. To search for such pairings, a novel co-cultured matrix screening technique was employed with sixteen unidentified bacterial species isolated from algae samples collected from the shores of O'ahu."
