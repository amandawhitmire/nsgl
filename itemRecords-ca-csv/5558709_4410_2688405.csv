11,Abstract:,"Juvenile lobsters fed brine shrimp demonstrate excellent growth and survival. Lobsters fed casein-based purified diets containing lecithin evidence high survival and relatively good growth; however, if lecithin is lacking, survival rates decrease precipitously; deaths typically results from the inability to complete ecdysis successfully, a syndrome termed 'molt death.' Kean et al. (1985) found that the absence of dietary lecithin did not result in molt death if crab protein rather than casein was the primary dietary source of protein, suggesting that molt death is not exclusively linked to lecithin-â€‹mediated cholesterol transport. This study investigated the effect of lecithin in combination with dietary casein or crab protein on levels of serum and lipoprotein cholesterol, labeled cholesterol distribution, apoprotein electrophoretic mobility, and fecal excretion of cholesterol in juvenile lobsters."
