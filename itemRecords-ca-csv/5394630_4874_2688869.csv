9,Abstract:,"The problem of the vertical entry of a rigid horizontal cylinder into an incompressible inviscid fluid initially at rest is considered. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to solve the resulting boundary-value problem. A new formula for the impact force is obtained, which differs from the classical von Karman's formula by a corrective term. The results obtained are compared with those of experimental observations and numerical calculations. The method may be extended to different geometries and non-vertical velocities to provide an estimate of the impact forces on the partially emerged pontoons of damaged semi-â€‹submersibles."
