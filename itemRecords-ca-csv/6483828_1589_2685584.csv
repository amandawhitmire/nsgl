12,Abstract:,"The Pacific geoduck, Panopea generosa (Gould, 1850), incorrectly referred to as the fossil species Panopea abrupta (Conrad, 1849) in much of the literature from 1984-2010 (Vadopalas et al. 2010), is a large hiatellid clam found in soft and subtidal substrates in the Northeast Pacific from California to Alaska. It may also occur west to Japan (Anderson 1971, Coan et al. 2000). Pacific geoduck are found in soft substrate from the low intertidal to more than 60 m (Goodwin 1976). Pacific geoduck are extremely long-lived, with many examples of animals more than 100 years old (Goodwin 1976, Shaul and Goodwin 1982, Sloan and Robinson 1984, Campbell and Ming 2003). Geoduck are broadcast spawners that commonly spawn in the spring and summer (Sloan and Robinson 1984, Campbell and Ming 2003). They produce larvae that remain planktonic for 47 days at 14 deg. C (Goodwin et al. 1979). Postlarvae settle onto the substrate and develop into juveniles that burrow into the sediment. Lucrative commercial Pacific geoduck fisheries exist in Washington and Alaska, British Columbia (Hoffmann et al. 2000), and Baja California (Aragon-Noriega et al. 2012). Other Panopea clam species occur worldwide, from Japan (P. japonica) to Argentina (P. abbreviata), New Zealand (P. zelandica), Mexico (P. globosa), and other regions; P. glycimeris was recently documented off the coast of Sicily (Scotti et al. 2011). The geography of these species is discussed in Section 1.7. This document will refer to Pacific geoduck as simply ""geoduck"" and make specific references to other species as appropriate."
