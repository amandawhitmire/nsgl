9,Abstract:,"Conflicts between ocean-going tugs and commercial crab gear caused problems along the Washington, Oregon, and California coasts in the early 1970s. Crab pots were fouling tugs and barges as they moved between ports, and the loss of crab gear was a serious economic problem for fishers. Through efforts by Sea Grant programs, an agreement was reached between commercial crab fishers and tug operators on areas where crab gear would not be set, providing lanes for tug and barge traffic. During its 28- year existence, the Crabber/Towboat Lane Negotiation Project has saved millions of dollars in gear and vessel repair costs for both users groups. This 2000 edition of the Towlane Charts is the result of discussions and final agreements between the two groups over a two-year period."
