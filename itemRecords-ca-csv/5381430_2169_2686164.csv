9,Abstract:,"Ichthyoplankton were sampled with bongos and microplankton with a pump at 3 to 5 discrete depths over isobaths of 8, 22 and 30 m; although no thermocline was present, fish larvae were significantly stratified by sampling depth during daylight hours and were relatively more dispersed at night. Larvae of northern anchovy ""Engraulis mordax"" and white croaker ""Genyonemus lineatus"" showed length-specific vertical distributions. Many large northern anchovy apparently migrated to the sea surface at night, but large white croaker did not. Early life stages of copepods were important foods for both fish species. Bivalve veligers and tintinids occurred relatively frequently in the guts of white croaker but not northern anchovy. There was little relation between daytime feeding distribution of fish larvae and esculent microzooplanktoâ€‹n. The diel vertical positions of neritic fish larvae may, in part, be an expedient strategy for their retention in shallow waters."
