16,Abstract:,"Ocean acidification is a global phenomenon with highly regional spatial and temporal patterns. In order to address thechallenges of future ocean acidification at a regional scale, it is necessary to increase the resolution of spatial andtemporal monitoring of the inorganic carbon system beyond what is currently available. One approach is to developempirica​l regional models that enable aragonite saturation state to be estimated from existing hydrographic measurements,fo​r which greater spatial coverage and longer time series exist in addition to higher spatial and temporalresolut​ion. We present such a relationship for aragonite saturation state for waters off Northern California based on insitu bottle sampling and instrumental measurements of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. Application of thisrelationshi​p to existing datasets (5 to 200 m depth) demonstrates both seasonal and interannual variability in aragonitesatura​tion state. We document a deeper aragonite saturation horizon and higher near surface aragonite saturation state inthe summers of 2014 and 2015 (compared with 2010–2013), associated with anomalous warm conditions and decadalscale oscillations. Application of this model to time series data reiterates the direct association between low aragonitesatura​tion state and upwelled waters and highlights the extent to which benthic communities on the Northern Californiashelf are already exposed to aragonite undersaturated waters."
