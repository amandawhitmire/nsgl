11,Abstract:,"To address copper pollution from antifouling paints, regulatory agencies are monitoring boat basins. Some regulatory programs have been created or proposed. For example, copper emissions from antifouling paints in Shelter Island Yacht Basin of northern San Diego Bay must be reduced by 76% during 2007-2022 under a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) regulatory program.6 TMDL programs have been recommended to reduce levels of copper and zinc in the major Southern California recreational boating harbors of Marina Del Rey7 and Newport Bay. In 2011 the Washington State Legislature passed a law that by 2020 would restrict copper content to 0.5% in antifouling paints that are applied to recreational boats up to 65 feet long. If restrictions on copper antifouling paints spread beyond northern San Diego Bay, more California boat owners will need the boating industry's assistance in applying, maintaining and controlling fouling on alternative hull coatings. These issues are complicated by the fact that some hull fouling species are ""invasive."" In other words, they can grow aggressively and outcompete native species for space and food, disrupting local ecosystems and affecting harbor structures. Scientists are finding that some invasive hull fouling species can tolerate copper antifouling paints, making them more difficult to control. By growing over the antifouling paint and thus creating a nontoxic surface, some copper tolerant species also facilitate fouling by nontolerant species. Regulatory agencies are concerned about transport of invasive species on hulls of boats, including recreational boats. The California Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) Management Plan, Strategy 2c: Recreation calls for limiting new AIS introductions through recreational boating, fishing, diving and other water-based activities. Thus, boat owners will also need the industry's assistance in controlling invasive species among hull fouling. Because California's coastal boaters travel to and from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and the Baja California peninsula, we surveyed boating industries in these areas, as well as on California's coast. Recreational boats moving among inland waterways, commercial boats and ships are beyond the scope of this report."
