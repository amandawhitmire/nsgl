15,Abstract:,"Grow-out tilapia farmers are encouraged to intensify their production through the use of good quality fry/fingerlings that could produce higher yield of tilapia. However, some tilapia farmers consider that younger broodfish produce better quality seed in terms of growth and survival. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of age of broodfish on the grow-out performance of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) fingerlings in earthen ponds. Twelve (12) 500 m2 ponds were stocked with sex-reversed Nile tilapia fingerlings of the GIFT strain. Each pond was stocked at 4 fish m-2. Four treatments with three replicates are applied as follows: Treatment I - fingerlings produced by 8 month-old broodfish, Treatment II - fingerlings produced by 1 year-old broodfish, Treatment III - fingerlings produced by 2 year-old broodfish and Treatment IV - equal combination of fingerlings from the three different ages of broodfish. After 120 days of culture fish were harvested, weighed and counted. Gross yield, final weight and length of fish, and survival rates were measured. Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT) was used for the comparison of means. The extrapolated gross yield per hectare showed that Treatment IV had the highest gross yield with 4472.7 + 619.1 kg ha-1 followed by Treatment III with 4045.3 + 1039.8 kg ha-1, Treatment II with 3719.3 + 365.5 kg ha-1 and Treatment I with 3667.3 + 689.3 kg ha-1. The treatments were not significantly different at 5% level of significance. The highest average final weight of 191.25 + 33.56 g and total length of 20.5 + 1.09 cm was seen in fish produced from 2 year-old broodfish (Treatment III). Treatment IV had an average final weight and total length of 182.41 + 33.46 g and 20.2+ 1.12 cm, respectively, followed by Treatment I with average final weight of 162.86 + 28.55 g and average final length of 19.5 + 1.15 cm and Treatment II with average final weight of 160.21 + 1.32 g and average final length of 19.4 + 0.17 cm. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of final mean weight and total length. In terms of survival rate, Treatment IV obtained the highest survival with 70.0 + 14.1 % followed by Treatment I with 61.3 + 22.9 %, Treatment II with 61.0 + 8.0 % and Treatment III with 53.8 + 4.6 %. Again, statistical analysis showed no significant difference among treatments (P>0.05). It is concluded that broodfish ranging from 8-24 months could be used for the production of Nile tilapia of the GIFT strain with no deleterious effects on fingerling growth and survival."
