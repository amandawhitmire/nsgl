12,Abstract:,"The lobster life cycle includes several stages that experience osmotic stress. First, as pelagic larvae suspended at the surface of the water column, near-shore larval lobsters encounter hypo-osmotic stress during periods of rainfall. As larvae, lobsters can tolerate reduced salinities. This tolerance, however, decreases as development proceeds. Following metamorphosis and settlement, intertidal juvenile lobsters can experience osmotic shifts due to springtime freshwater run-off, and these events can lead to mortality. Migrating seasonally into coves and estuaries to reproduce, adult lobsters may endure osmotic stress in brackish waters. To understand the molecular basis of osmotic stress responses ""in vivo"", the authors used homologous cDNA probes to characterize the mRNA patterns of lobster. Heat-shock proteins and polyubiquitin during hypo-and hyper-osmotic stress in abdominal muscle and hepatopancreas."
