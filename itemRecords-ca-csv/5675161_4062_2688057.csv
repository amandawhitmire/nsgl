12,Abstract:,"Naturally occurring monoterpenes from terrestrial organisms are frequently found as both enantiomeric modifications. Antipodal sesquiterpenes and higher terpenes, however, are less common. Furodysinin, one of several rearranged furanosesquiter​penes, isolated from marine sponges of the genus ""Dysidea"", has recently been shown to occur in both antipodal forms: (+)-furodysinin (3) or (-)-furodysinin (7a), depending on the species of ""Dysidea"" and its geographical location.1-3 Reported here are the isolation and absolute stereostructure of two new furanosesquiter​pene acetates, 1 and 2, from ""Dysidea herbacea"" collected from Harrier Reef on the middle Great Barrier Reef; they belong to the (+)- furodysinin series. In addition (-)-17, the enantiomer of 1, is reported from the same species of sponge collected from Norman Reef, less than 120 km away."
