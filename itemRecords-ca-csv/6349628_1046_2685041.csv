12,Abstract:,"Elk Kelp, Pelagophycus porra (Leman) Setchell, is commonly observed in deep (20-50 m) water along the outer edge of Giant Kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (C. Agardh), forests in southern California, USA and northern Baja California, Mexico, but rarely occurs in shallower water or within the adjacent M. pyrifera beds. To investigate the factors that limit P. porra from establishing populations within these shallower habitats, juvenile P. porra sporophytes were transplanted from a deep (20 m) water P. porra zone to shallower (15 and 8 m) sites within and inside an adjacent M. pyrifera beds. Transplanted P. porra exhibited no differences in survival or growth among depths, although reproductive maturity was observed only at the two shallower sites. When P. porra propagules were experimentally introduced to areas under dense M. pyrifera canopies and areas cleared of the M. pyrifera canopies within the shallower M. pyrifera bed, P. porra still failed to recruit even though this procedure resulted in a four-fold increase in recruitment in the natural P. porra zone. Laboratory-​based culturing of P. porra microscopic stages revealed that they grew and survived better under low light conditions characteristic of the natural P. porra zone (2-4 μmol photons m−2 s−1) than under higher light conditions characteristic of the M. pyrifera beds(18-20 μmol photons m−2 s−1). Pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry indicated that while naturally-​occurring P. porra's adult sporophytes were able to photoacclimate to increasing irradiance as they grew from the benthos towards the surface, P. porra's microscopic stages were unable to photoacclimate to increased irradiances, and subsequently exhibited 100% mortality under these higher light conditions. Altogether, our study suggests that vulnerability of P. porra microscopic stages to higher irradiances appears to be the primary factor inhibiting P. porra from establishing populations in shallower water and stresses the importance of a multiple life-history approach when investigating species distributions."
