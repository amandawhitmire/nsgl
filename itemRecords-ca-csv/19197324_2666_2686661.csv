13,Abstract:,"We present preliminary findings of the prevalence and abundance of the ectoparasite cyamid Cyamus ceti or “whale lice” on bowhead whales harvested for subsistence purposes from 1973 to 2014. There was a 20% prevalence of cyamids on the 645 bowhead whales examined for ectoparasites. We assessed several logistic regression models to determine factors associated with cyamid prevalence. Of the 134 whales that were examined for ectoparasites and which had an age estimate, the probability of cyamid presence increased with age. When present, cyamids typically occurred in low numbers (< 10 per whale). Several case histories provide ancillary information about the relationships between cyamid abundance and their bowhead hosts. Considering anticipated changes to arctic regions inhabited by bowhead whales, variability in the prevalence and/or intensity of cyamids may serve as a bio-indicator of change in bowhead whale health and/or environmental conditions."
