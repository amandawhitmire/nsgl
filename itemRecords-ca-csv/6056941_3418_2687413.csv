11,Abstract:,"Wetland managers face a difficult task: how best to use resources to acquire information about wetland condition necessary to make appropriate management decisions. It can be difficult to choose from the array of potential approaches, ranging from directly monitoring whole biotic communities to using proxy biomarkers and bioindicators (Adams and Ryon, 1994). Indicators employing population and community measures vary considerably in the scope of the information conveyed, as well as in the costs associated with using them. This leaves us with the two basic and pertinent questions when evaluating an indicator: (1) Does it provide information useful for management? (2) Is it cost-effective relative to other options? In this chapter, we review and elaborate on the application potential for using larval trematode parasites in snail hosts as biodiversity indicators. As we will demonstrate, larval trematodes in host snails are potentially very sensitive, ecologically relevant, and cost-effective bioindicators that reflect free-living community abundance, diversity, and trophic links. Our goals in this chapter are (1) to review the logical framework and supporting evidence of larval trematode parasites as bioindicators; (2) to list what types of these parasites and hosts are available around the world for use as indicators; (3) to articulate how larval trematode parasites could be included in a monitoring program; and (4) to explore the costs and benefits of using these parasites compared to traditional measures."
