11,Abstract:,"Lipid oxidation is considered a deteriorative process responsible for generating off-flavors; however, specific oxidation products are desirable flavor compounds, particularly when formed in more precise (i.e. less random) reactions. Lipoxygenases confer positional and stereospecificiâ€‹ty to the initiation reactions of lipid peroxidation. Gills of marine and freshwater fish were shown to contain two distinct lipoxygenases differing in specificity and stability. The products and volatile patterns responded to changing activities of these enzymes. This behavior is consistent with these enzymes being important to the biogeneration of fresh fish flavors."
