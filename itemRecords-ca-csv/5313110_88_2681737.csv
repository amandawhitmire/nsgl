10,Abstract:,"The Sea Grant Programs at the University of California and the University of Southern California have a strong commitment to marine education. It is hoped that this newsletter will help unify marine education efforts in the southwest (California, Arizona, and Nevada). The newsletter will inform educators of other marine education programs, available educational materials, important meetings and events, training sessions, and potential marine education activities. In addition, the newsletter will include summaries of important and, at times controversial, marine topics from a non-advocacy point of view."
