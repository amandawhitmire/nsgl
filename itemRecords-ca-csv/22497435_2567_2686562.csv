12,Abstract:,"This project aimed to create a detailed fault map for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta by mapping the faults throughout the Delta waterways. The project began with a review of existing data and reports, then a high-resolution seismic reflection and sidescan sonar survey, and finally, collection/anal​ysis, including radiocarbon dating, of sediment cores to create the first detailed fault maps for the Delta waterways. The project worked to constrain the significant rupture histories of the Kirby Hills and Midland Faults, which is important for understanding the potential of future earthquakes."
