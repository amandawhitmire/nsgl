8,Abstract:,"Much of the existing scientific and policy literature on fisheries bycatch has focused on the technological aspects of bycatch control. The result for fisheries management has been a rash of command and control regulation centered around gear restrictions and spatial and temporal limits on fishing effort. By contrast, there has been precious little consideration of the role of incentives in fostering or hindering bycatch avoidance and even less thought to the incentive structures found in many real-world fisheries. This thesis addresses this gap by developing analytical and empirical models for a particular case study with features that are analogous to many other fisheries: the flatfish fisheries of the Eastern Bering Sea. These fisheries are managed under a system of multiple common pool quotas on bycatch and target species which are enforced by quota-triggered closures. We develop a game theoretic model to explain how this system fosters suboptimal bycatch avoidance behavior on the part of fishermen due to their inability to fully capture the benefits of bycatch avoidance. As entry increases, fishermen face escalating discard costs, greatly shortened seasons and a rapid degeneration of rents relative to the optimal solution. We derive the bycatch penalty that aligns private incentives with the rent-maximizing solution and find, surprisingly, that this penalty must increase with improvements in the bycatch efficiency of the harvesting technology. To empirically consider the degree of bycatch avoidance in the fishery we develop a discrete choice model of fishing location choice at a fine level of spatial and temporal resolution. By integrating this model with sophisticated predictions of revenue and bycatch expectations we are unable to uncover the implicit cost of bycatch to fishermen as demonstrated in their avoidance iii permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission of bycatch over space and time. We find evidence of substantial avoidance in the last few weeks of the season but very little otherwise. This avoidance is dynamic and closely tied to factors such as the scarcity of bycatch quota, anticipated intensity of competition for bycatch and a vessel's horizon of participation. Even at its greatest, the implicit cost accorded to bycatch is well below its value as an unavoidable complement of fishing to the entire fleet. We also find substantial evidence that the common property quota system fosters excessive inertia in the movements of vessels over the fishing grounds. Finally, we utilize a variety of structural and reduced form modeling approaches to weigh the success of a voluntary program of information sharing and halibut bycatch avoidance. The presence of data both before and after the program's inception and the initial nonparticipatio​n of one cohort of vessels make our problem amenable to a number of variants of the difference-in- differences approach for uncovering the treatment effect of the program. Ultimately we find no basis for a positive impact of the voluntary program upon either halibut bycatch outcomes or upon the implicit costs of bycatch to participating fishermen. We confront a number of hypotheses on why cooperation apparently failed and ultimately conclude that poor overarching incentives from the common property quota system exacerbated by the biophysical traits of the bycatch species are likely to blame. This finding highlights the importance of both incentives and biophysical/tec​hnological factors in developing effective policies for bycatch reduction."
