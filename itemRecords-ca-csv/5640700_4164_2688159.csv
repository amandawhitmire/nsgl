11,Abstract:,"In order to increase in size, arthropods must first molt (shed) their confining exoskeleton. This molting process is under the immediate control of the steroid molting hormone 20- hydroxyecdysone (20-HE). There appear to be, however, other factors, both inhibitory and stimulatory, that regulate molting. This paper briefly summarizes some of the pertinent literature and then presents recent data on the humoral factors that may be involved in the mediation of molting."
