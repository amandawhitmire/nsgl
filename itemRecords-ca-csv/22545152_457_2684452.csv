12,Abstract:,"The intention of our monitoring and research is to provide science-based information to all stakeholders involved in salmon and steelhead recovery. Our work would not be possible without the support of our partners, including several public resource agencies and non-profit organizations, along with hundreds of private landowners who have granted us access to the streams that flow through their properties. In this seasonal monitoring update, we provide results from our spring downstream migrant trapping effort, as well as operation of PIT tag detection systems, located on Willow, Dutch Bill, Green Valley, and Mill creeks.The primary goals of this study were to estimate smolt abundance, natural production, freshwater survival, migration timing, and freshwater growth of the 2018 cohort (hatch year) of juvenile coho salmon in Willow, Dutch Bill, Green Valley, and Mill creeks using a combination of downstream migrant smolt trapping and operation of PIT tag antenna arrays."
