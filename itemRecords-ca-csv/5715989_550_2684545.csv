10,Abstract:,"The state of California since the Second World War is a particularly fertile field for policy inquiry. California's state fisheries laboratory was notable for some excellent basic science in biology, and for leadership in the applications of scientific data to management issues. The California Coordinated Oceanic Fisheries Investigation, or CalCOFl, is one of two landmark projects in the history of modern ocean science and state policy in California that are considered here. The other concerns the work during 1964- 1973 of two marine policy commissions, under auspices of the state government. In these examples, there are a number of important lessons suggested as to the conditions of success and failure-​-​lessons that can profitably be considered by those seeking to cope today with the daunting agenda of resource management."
