13,Abstract:,"Intensification of agricultural systems represents one of the most significant land use changes of the last century. High fertilizer inputs have been a key component of intensification and have contributed to increases in crop yield in most areas, but they can also cause profound alterations in the biogeochemical functioning of the soil, water, and air resources of these systems, particularly with regard to the nutrient nitrogen (N). Comprehensive studies linking field-scale fertilization with regional N fates and consequences for water resources are surprisingly sparse, particularly in the rapidly developing tropics and subtropics. Here we synthesize 15 years of research in wheat fields, drainage canals, estuaries, and coastal waters of the Yaqui Valley region of Sonora, Mexico. Although a relatively low proportion (<4%) of total N inputs are exported via surface water to the coast, the episodic nature of these losses can have significant ecological consequences. For instance, gaseous and dissolved N fluxes from agricultural fields are among the highest observed, and N-rich runoff from the Yaqui Valley fuels phytoplankton blooms in coastal waters. Reductions in N losses with improved timing of fertilizer application relative to crop demand are possible without negatively affecting crop yield or quality and may help to move this and similar regions closer to sustainability."
