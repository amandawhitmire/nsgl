11,Abstract:,"Among marine species with large fecundities and high pre-​reproductive mortality, the unpredictabilit​y of the ocean can result in only a small subset of the adult population contributing to each larval cohort, and reproduction may be viewed as a sweepstakes, with chance events determining which adults are successful each spawning season. Here scientists extend genetic analysis of sea urchin ""Strongylocentr​otus purpuratus"" populations to newly settled recruits to test two predictions of the sweepstakes reproductive success hypothesis. They evaluate whether genetic diversity is reduced in recently settled recruits relative to the adult population and determine whether different cohorts are genetically differentiated."
