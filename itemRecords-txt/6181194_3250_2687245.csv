9,Abstract:,"EcoViz is a group of projects developing ecosystem science visualization products for research, education, and management applications. Our goal is to research and develop landscape-scale visualization as a means to enhance linkages between complex scientific research data sets, decision makers, and the general public. We work as much as possible with real data and imagery, augmented where necessary with models, relying as little as possible on artificial proxy."
