11,Abstract:,"By pooling or removing samples of small size, we investigated how results from microsatellite analyses of spatial genetic structure in darkblotched rockfish (Sebastes crameri) were affected. Genotypes from six and seven microsatellite loci from 1206 specimens collected offshore from Washington to California were employed in the analyses. Sample sizes varied greatly among locations (n = 11- 114). When adjacent samples of n<25 were pooled using an absolute genetic distance (Fst"
