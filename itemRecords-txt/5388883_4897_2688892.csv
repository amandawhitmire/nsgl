11,Abstract:,"Research on the endocrine physiology of early salmonid development has advanced rapidly in recent years, not only with respect to smoltification-â€‹associated endocrine changes, but also in relation to their dependent physiological, morphological, and behavioral consequences. This overview concentrates on several broad and interrelated themes and suggests several directions where future work may lead."
