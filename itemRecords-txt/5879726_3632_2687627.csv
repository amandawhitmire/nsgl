12,Abstract:,"This investigation employed non-invasive 31P-NMR to describe the actions of copper in red abalone. Objectives were to characterize the adverse effects of copper on muscle metabolism and to propose a possible mechanism of toxicity. The authors determined metabolite concentrations including phosphoarginineâ€‹, inorganic phosphates and ATP, and the arginine kinase rate constant through acute exposure to copper. These were also measured at both the start and end of a 2-week sub-chronic exposure. Copper accumulation in gill, digestive gland, and foot muscle was determined to correlate disposition with toxicity."
