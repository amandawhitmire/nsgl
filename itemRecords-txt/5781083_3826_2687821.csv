12,Abstract:,"This study further documents the identification of 20- hydroxyecdysone (20E), in ""Paranemertes peregrina"", by gas chromatography/​mass spectrometry. Radioimmunoassa​y of the 40% and 80% methanolic fractions form an extract of 1000 worms indicated 98 and 156 ng of ecdysteroids, respectively. The reconstruction ion current chromatograms for m/z 561 indicated the presence of 20E at the correct retention time of 12.48 min in the 40% methanolic fraction. Reanalysis of the samples under selected ion monitoring mode demonstrated the presence of 20E in both the 40% and 80% fractions. These results demonstrate conclusively the presence of an active ecdysteroid in the phylum Nemertea."
