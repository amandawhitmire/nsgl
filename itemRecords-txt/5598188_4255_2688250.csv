8,Abstract:,"In this report, the accident that occurred on the platform Piper Alpha in the North Sea on July 6, 1988, resulting in 167 deaths, is analyzed both from a technical and an organizational point of view. The risk analysis framework is used to provide a systematic way of identifying (1) the accident sequence (failure mode) whose basic events include technical failures and human errors, (2) the decisions and actions that led to (or increased the probability of) the basic events, and (3) the organizational factors that influenced these decisions and actions. These organizational factors involved flaws in the design guidelines and design practices, in the management of the personnel on board, and in the process by which financial pressures are applied on the production sector (i.e., the oil companies' definition of profit centers) which can result in deficiencies in inspection and maintenance operations. One objective of this study is to derive from this analysis of the Piper Alpha accident a set of risk reduction measures, both technical and organizational, and an analytical approach to the assessment of their benefits."
