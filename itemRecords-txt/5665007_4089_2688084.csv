12,Abstract:,"Dungeness crab, ""Cancer magister"", is a soft bottom species distributed from California to Alaska that supports major fisheries over much of its range. High crab density in intertidal shell habitats is due to the combined effects of habitat choice and lower mortality in shell than in bare mud. Crab density in intertidal shell habitats decreases significantly through the summer. The decline in crab density in intertidal shell habitats is partially due to fish predation and cannibalism, and presumably to emigration. This paper examined whether the decline in crab density in intertidal shell habitat is regulated by density-â€‹dependent predation or emigration. Two factors (physical contact among conspecifics and food availability) were studied that may affect emigration and consequently the abundance of juvenile crabs in epibenthic shell habitats when recruitment has been successful."
