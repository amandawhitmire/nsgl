14,Abstract:,"Evidence is presented that ilimaquinone (IQ) vesiculates Golgi stacks through the activation of membrane-bound heterotrimeric G protein, without the involvement of the monomeric G protein called ARF and coatomers. The authors demonstrate that the disruptive effect of IQ can be inhibited by the addition of the inactive form of the G""alpha"" subunit. Results show that the free G""beta gamma"" subunits, rather than the activated G""alpha"" subunit, trigger the vesiculation of the Golgi stacks. These results provide insights into the mechanism by which the architecture of the Golgi membranes is regulated through signaling cascades mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins."
