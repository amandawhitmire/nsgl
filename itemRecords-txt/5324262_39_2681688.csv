11,Abstract:,"This is a report of the University of Southern California's (USC) eleventh year of participation in the national Sea Grant program. The Sea Grant program, funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, supports marine research, education and advisory services at several universities in the coastal and Great Lakes regions. Sea Grant research is primarily applied research, and USC, like every Sea Grant program, has a commitment to work with representatives of the public and industry to solve marine and coastal problems of importance to the region. The theme of our program and the title of this report, ""The Planning and Management of California's Coastal Resources,"" reflects that commitment. Eac​h year the USC Sea Grant program supports one or more projects in each of the following areas: socio-economic systems, living marine resources, non-​living marine resources, coastal engineering, marine education and advisory services. This annual report is for the period of 1980-1981"
