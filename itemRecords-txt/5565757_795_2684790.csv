11,Abstract:,"California has experienced two damaging earthquakes during the last three years. The October 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake was a 5.9 magnitude event, caused $358 million in damage, and took one life. The 7.1 magnitude Loma Prieta earthquake occurred on October 17, 1989. This moderately large earthquake had a duration of 15 seconds, took 62 lives, caused thousands of injuries, and property damage of almost $7 billion. These two destructive events demonstrate the need to improve earthquake planning and actively mitigate earthquake hazards. Strong ground motion data recorded during the Loma Prieta earthquake along with observed structural response needs continued analyses, providing invaluable insight into the impacts that a magnitude 7+ earthquake could have on a major metropolitan area in California and existing oil facilities, both onshore and offshore. This report summarizes engineering implications of such an earthquake as they relate to offshore oil production platforms in the coastal waters of California and Alaska."
