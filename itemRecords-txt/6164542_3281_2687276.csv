9,Abstract:,"The Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica is an important commercial species in Louisiana. The production of oysters from Louisiana has decreased due to predation, habitat destruction, disease, and the moratorium on leases. Off-bottom culture may be a feasible alternative to increase production, but fouling organisms, such as barnacles and bryozoans, can obstruct mesh openings, reducing growth and survival, and increasing maintenance. The Adjustable Longline System (ALS), commercially used in Australia, allows the oysters to be held at various depths to control culture conditions. This study used the ALS to determine a method of controlling biofouling by measuring 1) growth, 2) survival, and 3) fouling. At the Sea Grant Grand Isle Oyster Hatchery, the ALS was used to test 4 different treatments: a) weekly aerial drying; b) a monthly brine dip; c) daily exposure at low tide; and, d) control. Growth rate were measured monthly. Fouling was measured by counting organisms on ceramic tiles held on longline cable alongside oyster bags. Total fouling was measured by volume at harvest. Oysters reached the legal market size of 76 mm using the ALS within 12 months. Weekly aerial drying had less fouling than the either the control or brine dip treatments. The low-tide treatment had the least fouling, but the slowest growth rate. The efficient treatment was weekly aerial drying."
