10,Abstract:,"Through two-choice gustatory experiments, a preference hierarchy was established for the herbivorous gastropod ""Norrisia norrisi"" Sowerby, with laminarialean kelps preferred over all other seaweeds. Preference for kelp was not upheld in experiments using agarose thalli to which freeze-dried powder was added, suggesting the destruction of attractant chemicals during the making of the artificial foods. The authors' data suggest that the preference of ""N. norrisi"" for kelps over other potentially edible and palatable seaweeds may not be related to nutritional content, but instead may have evolved in response to factors such as availability, habitat provision, or refuge from predation."
