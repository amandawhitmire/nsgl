13,Abstract:,"Observations at Duck, North Carolina, suggest that longshore current variability is coherent with semidiurnal tidal fluctuations in water level. However, the generality of these results over the wide range of wave, wind, and bathymetric conditions observed at Duck is unknown. Here the cross-shore structure of the mean longshore current is explored with observations from the Duck94 field experiment."
