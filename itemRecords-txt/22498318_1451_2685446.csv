11,Abstract:,"The goal of this case study is to provide background information on the permitting process and to highlight an important aspect of operations – compliance – to shellfish growers and investors consi​dering operating in federal waters of the EEZ. Therefore, it is important to note that this case study is limited in scope to focus on the permitting process and NSSP compliance, and that all information is current as of November 2018. Section I will set the stage for the case study by providing background on CSR and a summary of the current regulatory process to obtain permits to operate a shellfish aquaculture facility in federal waters of the EEZ. Section II will describe the potential for a nationwide permitting process through S. 3138. Section III will provide a description and an analysis of the NSSP. Section IV will describe California’s implementation of NSSP requirements, followed by a discussion of the challenge of obtaining NSSP compliance for shellfish grown in federal waters of the EEZ in Section V. Section VI will conclude the case study with an analysis of current NSSP compliance requirements to grow and harvest molluscan shellfish in federal waters of the EEZ and the steps federal and state agencies, as well as growers, have implemented in order to comply with the NSSP."
