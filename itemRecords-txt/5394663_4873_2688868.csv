8,Abstract:,"In this study, juvenile coho salmon were obtained early and late in smoltification and the hormonal effects on various aspects of lipid metabolism were assessed. Results indicate that thyroxin, cortisol, growth hormone and prolactin all promote lipid mobilization by enhancing lipolysis. Exogenous hormone treatment early in salmonid development can initiate the metabolic responses (lipid depletion) normally seen later in development, depending on when and what hormone is administered. Whether hypophysectomy can abolish naturally high rates of lipid mobilization late in smoltification was also investigated."
