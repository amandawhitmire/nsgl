14,Abstract:,"Understanding species distributions and their community structure is increasingly important when taking an ecosystem-based approach to conservation and management. However, knowledge of the distribution and community structure of species in mid-range trophic levels (e.g. macroinvertebra​tes) is lacking in most marine ecosystems. Our study aimed to examine the spatial distribution and community-level biogeographic patterns of common kelp forest–rocky reef macroinvertebra​tes in Southern California and to evaluate the effects of environmental gradients on these communities. Quantitative SCUBA surveys were used to estimate macroinvertebra​te densities at 92 sites from 2008–2012. Non-metric multidimensiona​l scaling was used to evaluate spatial patterns of macroinvertebra​te communities among Regions. We found that kelp forest–rocky reef macroinvertebra​te communities are distinct among different island and mainland regions, and their community patterns exhibited a strong relationship with an environmental gradient (i.e. sea surface temperature) even after controlling for geographic distance between sites. High abundances of urchin species (Strongylocentr​otus purpuratus and Strongylocentro​tus franciscanus) were strong drivers of regional differences. Macroinvertebra​te community patterns were driven by characteristic species that were typically more prevalent at warmer or colder sites. Our results provide the first quantitative analysis of macroinvertebra​te community structure within the California kelp forest ecosystem. We also describe the distribution and abundance of 92 conspicuous kelp forest-rocky reef macroinvertebra​tes among nine pre-defined Regions. This study provides important preliminary information on these macroinvertebra​te species that will be directly useful to inform management of invertebrate fisheries and spatial protection of marine resources."
