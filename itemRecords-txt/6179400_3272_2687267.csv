9,Abstract:,"Nonproteinogeni​c amino acid residues and amino acid derivatives are common biochemical building blocks associated with the assembly of nonribosomal peptides and other natural products. Elucidating the biosynthetic pathways to these natural product biosynthetic building blocks has expanded our appreciation and fundamental knowledge of enzyme biocatalysts as well as helped fuel the fields of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Recent examples from our work on the biosynthesis and genetic engineering of novel nonproteinogeni​c amino acid moieties and amino acid derivatives from the marine bacterial natural products cyclomarin A, sporolide A and salinosporamide A will be presented to highlight the interplay of basic and applied biochemistry in the exploration of new chemical entities inspired from nature."
