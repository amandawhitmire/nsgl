12,Abstract:,"Recent developments in physical and bio-optical measurement technology have made it possible to develop an integrated set of observational platforms that enable detailed temporal and spatial observations of physical processes and the distributions and variability of particulate and chemical components in the ocean. Here this technology has been applied to the in-situ study of outfall plume mixing and dispersion in the coastal environment. These developments enable innovative, yet highly practical studies of the coupling of physical, chemical and biological processes in the coastal ocean. Not only is the fresh effluent field of concern, but the deposited sediments from the outfall may also be an important environmental issue. Until recently, oceanographic sampling technology has not been adequate for the study of the behavior and dispersion of these plumes in situ."
