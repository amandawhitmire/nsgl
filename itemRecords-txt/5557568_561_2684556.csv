10,Abstract:,The conflict between the multiple users of California'a ocean and coastal zone have made management of the state's natural resources problematic. Policy makers have failed to balance the interests of the various users and act in a coordinated fashion to solve problems and they have yet to develop an integrated approach to ocean and coastal zone management. The fragmented responsibilitie​s and activities of the state agencies involved in managing California's ocean and coastal resources are briefly reviewed. Two fundamental mechanisms for encompassing externalities and balancing diverse interests--the ad hoc organization and the regional organization-​-​are discussed. It is suggested here that different forms of integrating mechanisms are appropriate for different ocean and coastal policy areas; and that different social principles will govern the decision-making and planning processes.
