9,Abstract:,"On May 26, 2006, California became the first state to enact stringent environmental standards for marine finfish aquaculture. California's aquaculture industry currently brings in $83 million a year and is expect to grow as the demand for fish increases. The Sustainable Oceans Act, SB 201, requires the Department of Fish and Game (Department) to administer leases for marine finfish farming in state waters and mandates that the State Water Resources Control Board (Board) and regional water boards monitor water quality surrounding aquaculture operations."
