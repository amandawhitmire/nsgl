11,Abstract:,"Scalaradial (SLD), a marine natural product isolated from the sponge ""Cacospongia sp."", possesses anti-​inflammatory properties in-vivo and in-vitro. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of action of SLD using bee venom PLA2. As reported here, SLD is a potent, apparent irreversible inactivator of bee venom PLA2, acting at a site near the substrate binding site. Kinetic studies indicate that SLD inactivation of PLA2 occurs with the formation of an initial noncovalent, reversible Michaelis-type complex prior to covalent modification of the enzyme."
