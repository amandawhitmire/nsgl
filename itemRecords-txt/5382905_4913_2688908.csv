9,Abstract:,"We report the results of experiments designed to investigate the presence of MIH-like (molt-â€‹inhibiting hormone) activity in larvae of ""Homarus americanus"". Previously, it was determined that eyestalk ablation of these larvae abbreviates subsequent molt intervals. In the present study, ablated larvae were injected with sinus gland extracts possessing known MIH activity as assayed in juvenile lobsters; subsequent effects of these injections on molt intervals and whole larval ecdysteroid titers indicate that MIH may act to inhibit ecdysteroid production by the larval molting gland."
