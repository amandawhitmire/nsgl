10,Abstract:,"Sponges of the genus ""Dysidea"" are renowned for the variability of their chemical constituents. Although terpenoids are found in both temperate and tropical species, the polyhalogenated metabolites appear to be limited to tropical species of ""Dysidea"" that coincidentally contain large populations of cyanophytes within their tissues. Interest in the correlation of polyhalogenated metabolites with the presence of cyanophytes led to examination of several ""Dysidea"" species from the Philippines. This paper reports the isolation and characterizatio​n of a new polybrominated diphenyl ether, 2-​(2'-​bromophenoxy)-​3,4,5,6-​ tetrabromopheno​l."
