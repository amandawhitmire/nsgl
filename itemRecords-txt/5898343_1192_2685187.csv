11,Abstract:,"Designation as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can protect coastal ecosystems, but apparently has not effectively protected the rocky intertidal zone in urban southern California, where illegal collecting and habitat disturbance harm coastal marine life. For this report, researchers surveyed day visitors to sandy beaches or adjacent rocky habitats in Orange County. Using the close- ended, double-bounded contingent valuation method, they estimate the benefit of more effective enforcement and management of MPAs, and the average willingness-​to-​pay for enacting policies to reduce illegal collecting and onsite habitat disturbance to average $6 per family-visit. This estimate is consistent with other studies that estimate consumer surplus at $15 per person-trip for nearby, lower quality beaches, and extrapolates from other studies to $3.6 - $4.8 million per mile of coastline."
