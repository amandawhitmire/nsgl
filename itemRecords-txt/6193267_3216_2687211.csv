8,Abstract:,"California and the U.S. EPA are reevaluating antifouling paint registration and water-quality standards for dissolved copper. Research shows hull-borne aquatic invasive species tolerate copper better than native species, giving them a competitive edge in harbors polluted by copper. Recent water-quality regulations require San Diego Bay boat owners to reduce copper discharges from antifouling paints, and if similar antifouling paint restrictions are adopted elsewhere, nontoxic and less-toxic hull coatings will become more common. However, such coatings require companion strategies to control fouling growth, and while the National Aquatic Invasive Species (NAIS) Act of 2005 prescribes antifouling paints to control AIS, nontoxic hull coatings simply slow fouling growth rather than preventing it. The NAIS Act discourages in-water hull cleaning, yet frequent cleaning is needed to manage fouling growth on nontoxic hull coatings. (In San Diego, hauling and cleaning is nine times more expensive than in-water hull cleaning.) The authors prepared a white paper and policy analysis to assist decision makers, scientists and stakeholders in developing research, education and sustainable policies for controlling AIS while reducing antifouling paint pollution."
