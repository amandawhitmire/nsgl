8,Abstract:,"Patterns of spatial and temporal variation in recruitment of larval kelp bass, ""Paralabrax clathratus"", to reefs at Santa Catalina Island (California) are described. Much of this variation was explained by changes in time and space in the density of the surface-canopy forming giant kelp, ""Macrocystis pyrifera"". Density manipulations of giant kelp revealed a causal effect on recruitment of kelp bass; results indicate that features of the settlement habitat, and not a limited supply of larvae, contributed most to variation in local recruitment of kelp bass. Alternate hypotheses regarding mechanisms underlying the relationship between ""Macrocystis"" and recruitment of kelp bass were explored in detail."
