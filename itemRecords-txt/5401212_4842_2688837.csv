11,Abstract:,"The structure of a new marine-​sponge-​derived polyunsaturated acyclic furanosesterter​pene, ircinic acid (1), and stereochemical features in known sesterterpenes, including ircinin-1(2) and ircinin-2(3), have been elucidated by several NMR strategies that unambiguously solve the stereochemical problems associated with their unsaturated bonds."
