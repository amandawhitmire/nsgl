10,Abstract:,"A broadband, multiple-angle acoustic array was used to classify millimeter to centimeter sized live zooplankton in a laboratory tank. Reflections in the frequency range from 1.5 to 2.5 MHz were recorded from untethered 1-4 mm calanoid copepods and 8-12 mm mysids over an angular range of 0-47 degrees. A synchronized, coregistered video system recorded animal location and orientation. To highlight differences between animals, a frequency correlation matrix was computed from the observed wide-band power spectra of the scattered sound. Significant differences in the slopes and shapes of the eigenvalue spectra of this matrix were found for mysids versus copepods. These results support the idea that broadband, multiple-angle scatter can be used to classify organisms of different sizes and shapes."
