10,Abstract:,"Interactions of six carbohydrates (trehalose, sucrose, glucose, raffinose, inositol, and glycerol) with dry dipalmitoylphos​phatidylcholine​ (DPPC) were studied. Results showed that trehalose depressed the main transition temperature of dry DPPC below that of fully hydrated DPPC, and raised the enthalpy of that transition more than did addition of water. It is suggested that the mechanism of interaction between the carbohydrate (with the exception of glycerol) and lipid involves hydrogen bonding between OH groups on the carbohydrate and the phosphate head group of the phospholipid."
