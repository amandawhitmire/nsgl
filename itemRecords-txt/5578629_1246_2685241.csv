9,Abstract:,"A major El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event occurred in the tropical Pacific during 1982-1983. A pronounced and anomalous warming along the West Coast, coupled with anomalous, high sea levels and record high offshore steric heights confirmed that a major mid-latitude North Pacific coastal warming event also occurred during 1982-1983. This event also was observed off Oregon and as far north as British Columbia and Alaska. The purpose of this paper is to document the temporal development of the 1982-1983 and 1940-1941 mid-latitude North Pacific coastal warming events off southern California and to show that the observed environmental and biological response of the California Current to these events is consistent with the direct atmospheric forcing associated with the expansion of the Aleutian Low."
