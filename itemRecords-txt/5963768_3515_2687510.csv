13,Abstract:,"Although they are magnificent adaptations for predation and protection, the lobster's large claws pose an anatomical dilemma for molting. The diameters of the proximal leg segments and the exoskeletal openings at the base of the claws are too narrow to allow the large front claw muscles to fit through. This predicament appears to be solved by way of hormonal mediation. The claw muscle undergoes atrophy in correlation with increasing ecdysteroid (steroid molting hormone) titers during premolt. The authors had hypothesized that molecular chaperones would be expressed over the molt cycle and in particular during premolt atrophy. Here they examined the in vivo mRNA levels of molecular chaperones and polyubiquitin, a marker for protein degradation, in claw versus abdominal muscles from individual premolt and intermolt lobsters. Polyubiquitin gene expression was assayed as a marker for muscle atrophy. They found that both polyubiquitin and various chaperone mRNA levels were significantly higher in claw than in abdominal muscle, and during premolt as compared to intermolt."
