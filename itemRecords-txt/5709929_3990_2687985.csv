10,Abstract:,"The sponge ""Astrosclera willeyana"" contains seven new bromopyrrole alkaloids, together with the known alkaloids bromoageliferin and dibromoagelifer​in. The structures of the new alkaloids, ageliferins that are methylated on one or both of the pyrrole nitrogens, were elucidated by interpretation of spectral data. Chemotaxonomic relationships involving bromopyrrole alkaloids are discussed in the light of this research."
