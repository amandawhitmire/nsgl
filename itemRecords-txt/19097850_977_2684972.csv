9,Abstract:,"In 2015, widespread high levels of a naturally occurring biotoxin, domoic acid, were found in some crab species in California. As a result, the opening of the Dungeness crab fishery was postponed and area closures of the northern and southern rock crab fisheries were implemented in November 2015. This document addresses some questions raised about these closures."
