9,Abstract:,"Simon (1974, 1978) hypothesized that membrane structure in dry organisms is disorganized, with phospholipids in an inverted hexagonal phase and integral membrane proteins displaced from their environment in the bilayer, thus accounting for initial leakage upon rehydration. Because hexagonal phase phospholipid has not been demonstrated in organisms which normally survive desiccation, the authors would like to suggest an alternative explanation for the leakage of dry organisms. Although phospholipids may still form an intact bilayer in dry systems, this bilayer is composed of a large array of different phospholipids, some of which may be in gel phase when dry at ambient temperatures. As these gelphase lipids are rehydrated, they can undergo a gel-​to-​liquid-​crystalline-​phase transition. Many studies have shown that liposomes show increases in permeability to water as well as to ions, carbohydrates, and other solutes while undergoing the gel-​to-​liquid-​crystalline transition. Initial leakage from desiccation-​tolerant systems placed in water may occur because of hydration-​induced phase transitions in the bilayers."
