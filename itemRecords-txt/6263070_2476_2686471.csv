21,Abstract:,"physical forcings on the longer-term evolution of this coastal ecosystem. Our approach helps us understand which processes cause immediate impacts on coastal waters during storms as well as those involved in the biogeochemical response subsequent to these events. The CRIMP-CO2 buoy in Kaneohe Bay documented the response of the bay to a series of intense pulses associated with a particularly wet La Nina winter season (2005-2006). Because the CRIMP-CO2 acquires time- series data at a single location, complementary but lower frequency measurements were made at a network of stations that are spatially distributed throughout the bay. This allowed elucidation of the relationships between physical, biological, and chemical processes in the bay during and subsequent to phytoplankton blooms. Significant drawdown of CO2 in the water column of Kaneohe Bay following these pulsed inputs is attributable to phytoplankton blooms and temporarily changes the bay from a net source to a net sink of CO2. Physical forcing strongly influences how the system responds, in particular stratification/​mixing, therefore controls the duration of blooms and the attendant changes in CO2 concentration."
