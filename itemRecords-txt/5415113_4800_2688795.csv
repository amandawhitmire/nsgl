10,Abstract:,"The whole-animal content of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) was measured in embryonic and larval coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") by radioimmunoassa​y following the validation of an extraction method. The presence and clearance of T4 from the yolk suggest that T4 may be critical to normal larval morphogenesis, that initially the T4 is of maternal origin, and that the hypothalamo-​adenohypophysia​l-​thyroid axis begins to function independently at or near the time of emergence."
