11,Abstract:,"This research shows that the persistence of populations in marine reserves depends on the fraction of natural larval settlement (FNLS) remaining after the implementation of reserves, a quantity that depends on reserve configuration and larval dispersal distance. The authors determine conditions on FNLS for sustainability of populations in marine reserves, whether they are designed for fishery management or maintenance of biodiversity."
