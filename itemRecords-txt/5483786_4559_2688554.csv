10,Abstract:,"Jasplakinolide (jaspamide) was the first macrocyclic mixed polyketide-​depsipeptide to be reported from a marine sponge and was the subject of a recent total synthesis. This natural product has notable biological properties including anthelminthic, cytotoxic, selective antimicrobial, insecticidal, and ichthyotoxic activities. A complexation study was carried out with jasplakinolide and univalent metal ions Li+, Na+, and K+. Li+ binding was observed with just one of the two major solution conformations. The complex was characterized by NMR and molecular mechanics calculations. This study represents the first report on complexation between a mixed polyketide-​depsipeptide and metalion."
