8,Abstract:,The principal objective for this multifaceted measurement program was to determine if there is a causal link between offshore wastewater discharge and significant bacterial contamination along the Huntington Beach (California) shoreline. A secondary objective was to determine the principal coastal-ocean circulation patterns in the region. Results are presented in this draft technical report executive summary along with a comparison of conditions during the summer of 2001 with those of 1999 and other years with a high incidence of surf zone bacterial contamination.
