9,Abstract:,"Before removal of oysters from Drakes Estero, CA there was no information on phytoplankton biomass or communities in the Estero. To determine spatial and temporal changes in phytoplankton communities, after removal, from June-December 2016 and May-November 2017 phytoplankton at five estero locations and a beach station in Drakes Bay were identified. Chlorophyll concentrations decreased from mouth to head. Spring and summer communities were similar, but phytoplankton were different in fall. Diatom abundance was associated with higher upwelling indices and nitrate concentrations, and cooler temperatures. Dinoflagellates and flagellates correlated with warmer temperatures. The dominant functional groups followed classic Margalef’s Mandala. Increasing global temperatures may result in larger or increased frequency of blooms."
