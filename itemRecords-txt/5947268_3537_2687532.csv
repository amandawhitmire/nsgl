11,Abstract:,"There is considerable interest in assessing the degree and spatial pattern of genetic structure in the Dungeness crab ""Cancer magister"". To that end, scientists developed a series of 17 hypervariable microsatellite loci. Six of these 17 loci could be amplified in a single multiplex PCR reaction. Using dye-labeled primers all six loci can be coamplified and scored simultaneously on an automated sequencer. The ability to multiplex loci greatly increases the ease and speed of genotyping for this species."
