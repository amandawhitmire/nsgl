9,Abstract:,"Shell pigmentation in post-larval (1.5 mm) ""Mytilus edulis"" is controlled by light intensity. This relationship was used to develop a method for tagging, as well as to infer the light regime experienced by wild post-larvae. Growth was temporarily slowed during the light phase of the tagging process. No effect of the tag on subsequent survival was seen. Since the tag consists of a pigment band in both the periostracum and the prismatic shell layers, it persists until these layers erode away. The utility of the tag in a field trial is described."
