12,Abstract:,"Dairy farms and grazing livestock ranches are integral to the working landscape of California's coast. The landscape, land use history, and livestock distributions of each farm and ranch are unique and constantly changing. Successful farmers and ranchers continuously adapt land use practices to address the challenges of livestock operations, environmental stewardship, and the agriculture economy. Ranch plans integrate these elements to achieve operation viability, including the implementation of management practices that improved water quality. In general, high-use areas should be seeded and mulched by late October to mid-November. Realistically, multiple practices such as mulching and seeding in concert with vegetative filter strips are needed in high-use areas in order to address the water quality concerns on your operation. However, the annual combination of seeding and mulching areas of particular water quality concern can significantly reduce potential pollutant delivery downstream. This practice is a useful addition to the ranch manager's ""tool-box"" for stewardship in twenty-first century California."
