12,,"Four tissue dispersion apparatuses were compared to determine which was most effective in recovering infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) from rainbow trout (""Salmo gairdneri""). The Omnitron, Polytron, Stomacher, and mortar and pestle, routinely used in fish virology laboratories, were equally effective in liberating IPNV from carrier tissues; there were no significant differences in the concentrations recovered by the four methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed."
