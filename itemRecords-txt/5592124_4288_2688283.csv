13,Abstract:,"The Dover sole ""Microstomus pacificus"" is distributed from northern Baja California to the Bering Sea at depths to at least 1,100 m. No coastwide assessment of Dover sole stock(s) has been published to date, although one is 'pending.' Stock delineation is an important first step in the assessment process, and in 1985 a working group was established by the Technical Subcommittee of the Canada-United States Groundfish Committee to collate the available coastwide information from tagging studies on stock delineation of Dover sole. This has been accomplished. The purpose of this report is to summarize the evidence for stock delineation, based on the reports of the individual fisheries agencies."
