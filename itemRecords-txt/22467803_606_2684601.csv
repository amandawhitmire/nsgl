12,Abstract:,"Although abalone culture continues to advance, the basics have not really changed all that much. This summary was adapted from the University of California Cooperative Extension publication ASAQ-A10, by Susan McBride, UC Sea Grant Extension Program, and Fred S. Conte, Department of Animal Science, UC Davis. Abalone culture was first attempted in the US at Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific Grove, California in 1940. Initial efforts focused on spawning adult red abalone and studying the larval stages. California abalone growers have cultured nearly all of the state’s native species. However, because of their value and adaptation to culture technology, the red abalone and, to a lesser extent, the pink and green abalone have been the principal species grown in California aquaculture facilities."
