9,Abstract:,"The neurotransmitte​r gamma-​aminobutyric acid (GABA) is present, in invertebrates, in tissues of the central nervous system (CNS). Although a number of neurotransmitte​r substances have been identified in the mammalian CNA, GABA appears to be, quantitatively at least, one of the most important. The functions of GABA are highly diverse in mammalian nervous systems, both GABA and GABA receptors being widely distributed in the human brain and spinal cord; consequently, a large number of brain and other CNS disorders are a result of GABA system malfunctions. This paper describes a novel class of nontoxic bioactive oligopeptides, found in marine red algae and cyanobacteria, that were more active in competing for specific 3H-muscimol binding to the mammalian GABA receptors than GABA itself, demonstrating their potential as a new class of potent GABA-analogs."
