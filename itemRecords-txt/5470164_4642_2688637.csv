9,Abstract:,"The ova of ""Sicyonia ingentis"" lack cortical vesicles at the time of spawning. Within 30 min post-spawning, two populations of cortical vesicles are organized in the ooplasm which, during cortical vesicle exocytosis (cortical reaction), successively release two morphologically different exudates. During exocytosis of the dense vesicles an electron dense material is released which coalesces with the surface coat of the ovum to form a thin hatching envelope which eventually lifts from the ovum's surface. Subsequent to the formation of the thin hatching envelope, the ring vesicles undergo exocytosis resulting in an accumulation of ring-shaped structures in the perivitelline space. These structures coalesce and form an electron translucent layer on the inner surface of the thin elevated envelope to form the thickened hatching envelope."
