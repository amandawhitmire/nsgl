12,Abstract:,"An unidentified ascidian from the Arabian Sea contained nine new alkaloids of the lamellarin class together with lamellarin N. The structures of the 20-sulfate derivates of lamellarins T, U, V, and Y and lamellarins T-X were identified by interpretation of spectroscopic data. This is the first report of lamellarin sulfates."
