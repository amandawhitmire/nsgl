9,Abstract:,"These 1/2"" VHS training video tapes are available on loan for one-week time periods. A maximum of two tapes can be borrowed at one time. A fee of $3.00 per tape (check or money order to UC Regents) must be prepaid to cover postage and insurance. The borrower must pay return mailing costs and insure each tape ($100.00 per tape) in case of damage or loss in the mail. Ranging in length from 10 minutes to nearly an hour, they cover subjects in commercial fishing (2 tapes), food service (5 tapes), seafood processing (6 tapes), and retailing (29 tapes). One video addresses contaminants in sports fish, and another is about domoic acid, a natural toxin."
