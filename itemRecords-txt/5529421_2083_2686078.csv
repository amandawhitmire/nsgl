11,Abstract:,"The goals of this workshop and publication are to stimulate multidisciplina​ry research, discussion, and innovative fishery management techniques directed at lessening fishery bycatch and discard problems. Panel presentations and discussions focused on likely bycatch and discard problem consequences under six primary management schemes: unregulated, seasons, quotas, mesh restrictions, limited entry, and individual transferable quotas. Discard probems under each management scheme and recommended research needs and ideas for lessening bycatch problems were discussed."
