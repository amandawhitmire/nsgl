9,Abstract:,"The use of properly formulated cleaning compounds is an important part of any food plant sanitation program. Cleaning compounds may contain one or more ingredients based on the type of soil to be removed, the surface to be cleaned, the hardness of the water, and the application method to be used. Cleaning compounds are formulated to achieve a number of results; because no single chemical can satisfy all the requirements, it is essential to have the proper blend of ingredients. This publication is designed to help the user select the proper compound for individual sets of circumstances by characterizing the variables involved."
