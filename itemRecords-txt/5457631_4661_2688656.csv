9,Abstract:,"This paper summarizes research on the movements and migrations of coho salmon during their first summer in the northeast Pacific based on purse seine catches made mainly in coastal waters off Oregon and Washington. The data indicate that juvenile coho migrations are of limited extent during their first summer in the ocean, and do not strongly support an earlier conclusion that juvenile coho salmon from the Columbia River, Oregon, and California may form a large proportion of the stocks of this species that migrate northward along the coastal belt in Canadian and Alaskan waters each summer."
