9,Abstract:,"Biochemical reactions, particularly those influencing lipids and proteins, contribute to the loss in quality of fish muscle during frozen storage. This work reviews the literature between 1980 and 1990 with respect to factors influencing the rate of biochemical reactions in frozen fish, i.e. storage temperature, partial freezing, rate of freezing, species differences, intraspecific factors, post-harvest history prior to freezing, and cryoprotectantsâ€‹. The mechanism of trimethylamine n-oxide demethylation is discussed with reference to soluble enzymes, microsomal enzymes and non-enzymatic reactions. The importance of phospholipid hydrolysis in frozen fish is discussed and related to recent findings on microsomal phospholipase A and the interrelation of hydrolysis and oxidation. While non-enzymatic mechanisms of lipid oxidation are important in frozen fish, this review emphasizes recent studies indicating the importance of reactions catalysed by soluble lipoxygenase and microsomes."
