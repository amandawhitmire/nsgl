13,Abstract:,"Welcome to ""Fish on Your Dish"", a newspaper supplement about local commercial fisheries written by kids for kids! The youth editorial board, the Fin-atic Reporters, fully submerged themselves into the world of commercial fisheries of the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) region to produce this newspaper. They did the research, wrote the articles, and identified artwork and games to make this newspaper a fun learning experience. Now your students and children will learn about commercial fishing operations, factors affecting fisheries, fish and shellfish of the local waters and more through the experiences of the Fin-atic Reporters! Why did the Fin-atic Reporters write about commercial fisheries? Because many kids (and adults) are not familiar with the commercial fisheries that occur in the ocean waters right in their own backyard. They also are confused about whether to eat local seafood because of reports of problems in fisheries worldwide. But did you know that the Santa Barbara Channel region is a productive area for fisheries, providing a substantial amount of California seafood to consumers worldwide? Combined, the four ports that serve the local fisheries (three in Ventura County and one in Santa Barbara County) were ranked third in production (50.5 million pounds landed) and third in value ($19 million ex-vessel value) among the nine marine regions of California. Also, although some fishery stocks require rebuilding, the Santa Barbara Channel region is an area that currently has many healthy fisheries for all to enjoy. Of course, we all need to do our part to keep our fisheries sustainable and our oceans healthy. This newspaper is a first step in increasing the knowledge of your students or children about local fisheries and their complexities so they can make informed decisions regarding seafood consumption, conserving ocean resources and improving the quality of local ocean waters. As you take the plunge into the world of commercial fisheries, your classroom or family will learn about the top local fisheries and how local fish (including shellfish) make it to your dish. Keep in mind that fisheries differ from place to place and continually change in response to many factors. Thus, it is a vast and complex world that provides many opportunities for continued research by your students or children."
