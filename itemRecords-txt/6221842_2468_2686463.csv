13,Abstract:,"Reports of coral degradation due to disease have been increasing worldwide over the last decade. A comparatively high prevalence of coral diseases has been reported in the Wai'ōpae tide pools on the southeast coast of Hawai`i Island. Here, corals of the genus Montipora are particularly prone to succumbing to reduced health states, with 14.9�0.75% of Montipora colonies suffering from several unhealthy conditions consistently during the last three years of surveys. This study focused on the skeletal growth anomalies (SGAs) impacting Montipora capitata because of their high prevalence and lack of etiological data and definitive field diagnoses. Morphological assessment of the skeletal microstructure using macro photographic image analysis showed that these SGAs can be classified into two diagnosable categories for M. capitata; Type A and Type B. Type A SGAs have a significant reduction in polyp and tuberculae density with many tuberculae becoming fused and protrusive. Type B SGAs have no discernable polyps and have fused and protuberant coenosteum. Closer analysis revealed that Type A lesions suffer polyp density reduction by 50�0.18% compared to healthy M. capitata tissue. Using these diagnostic criteria, we conducted an exhaustive survey of M. capitata at Wai'ōpae and found the prevalence of Type A SGAs to be 30.7% and Type B SGAs to be 9.1% among all the colonies observed. Impacts of SGAs on the physiology of corals and potential correlations with water quality parameters are presently being investigated in order to assess how this coral population as a whole is impacted by this disease."
