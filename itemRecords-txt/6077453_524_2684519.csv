10,Abstract:,"In the summer of 2000, ""Caulacanthus ustulatus"" was first observed in southern California waters. Since then, this species has become very abundant at several intertidal sites where it grows on articulated corallines, rockweed stipas, rock, mussel shells, and barnacles. Here we provide the first reports of the effects of temperature on dark respiration rates and the photosynthetic responses of southern California specimens of ""C. ustulatus"". Maximum photosynthetic rates (Pmax) ranged from 4.54 (+/-0.35SE) to 3.75 (+/-0.29) mg O2g^-1 dwt h^-1 but did not vary significantly (ANOVAP P=0.29)over the tested temperatures (11, 14, 17 and 20 deg C). Light-limited slopes (a) ranged from 0.0696 (+/-0.01 SE) to 0.0582 (+/-0.01) but also did not vary significantly (ANCOVA; P=0.86) with temperature. Similarly, temperature had no significant effect (ANOCA: P=0.46) on dark respiration rates, which ranged from 0.78 +/- (0.16 SE) to 0.44 (+/-0.11) mg O2g^-1 dwt h^-1. Light compensation ranged from 12.8 (+/- 2.9 SE) at 17 deg C to 7.1 (+/- 1.86) umol m^-2 s^-1 at 11 deg C. These data show that the photosynthetic performance of ""C. ustulatus"" is similar over the range of temperatures encountered in southern California and along the remainder of the California coast and suggest that ""C. ustulatus"" is able to grow and likely establish populations throughout this entire region."
