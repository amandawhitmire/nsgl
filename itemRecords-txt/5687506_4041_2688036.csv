15,Abstract:,"The information contained in this report provides the first regional database of physical shoreline resources of open beaches in Washington, Oregon, and northernmost California. This report contains aerial photogrammetry data taken from about 2,000 reference points, spaced at half-kilometer intervals, along the 1,000-km-long study area; and profile data taken at 127 across-shore sites in 18 representative littoral cells of the Pacific Northwest coastal zone. These selected littoral cells represent a total of 500km in coastal distance, or about 75 percent of the beach-fronted study area. The database has been loaded into three separate data files in Excel 4.0 spreadsheet format for either the Apple or DOS system. The information can be used to map and analyze the regional distributions of different types of shorelines including rocky headlands, sandy beaches, tidal inlets, dune fields, and coastal terraces."
