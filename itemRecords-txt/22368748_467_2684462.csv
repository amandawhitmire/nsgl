13,Abstract:,"Larval transport by marine organisms is regulated by a combination of vertical swimming behavior and seasonalreprodu​ctive timing, but recent studies suggest horizontal swimming behaviors may also be important. Larvae inhighly productive coastal upwelling regions are especially vulnerable to offshore transport and must employeffective dispersal “strategies” to return onshore to suitable settlement sites. Using a primitive-​equation numericalmodel, we investigate how horizontal swimming affects nearshore larval supply and potential settlementand connectivity during climatological spring and summer in central California, a region of persistent coastalupwellin​g within the California Current System. The addition of shoreward swimming with speeds of 1–7 cms−1increases nearshore larval supply by a factor of 1.4–13, depending on the speed, timing of its onset, and thevertical swimming behavior of the larvae, which included both diel and ontogenetic vertical migrations.Near​shore larval supply increases approximately linearly with swimming speed integrated over the pelagic larvalduration. While pelagic connectivity increases with shoreward swimming for all vertical behaviors investigated,sp​atial patterns of connectivity, when standardized by nearshore larval supply, are similar with and withouthorizont​al behavior. Onshore swimming broadens the alongshore extent of areas that can act as effective sourceregions in central California, increasing potential dispersal distances 11–26%. A related statistic, the reversepelagic connectivity, reveals Monterey Bay and the Gulf of the Farallones as important source regions thatshould be considered when adaptively managing California's network of marine protected areas."
