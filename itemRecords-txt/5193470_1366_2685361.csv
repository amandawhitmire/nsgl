11,Abstract:,"Public concern for the protection and enhancement of coastal waters has grown during the past few years. 'There is every indication that concern of environmental pollution will persist and that public interest will increase its demand for correction of man-induced pollution. This report is the result of a short term general survey of the environmental variables of a semi-enclosed coastal water, but with full recognition of the importance of the long term nature of any meaningful ecological survey. Because variation in environmental quality can occur in a water body from time to time, point to point, long term monitoring of the essential parameters is an important step for the preservation of environmental quality, and as the basis for the management of coastal environmental and resources. The objective of this study is to examine the current environmental conditions of the marina, and to investigate potential sources of contamination from the surrounding environment. There are three inclusions in this report, Chapter II contains detailed analytical methods pertaining to chemical analysis used in this study. Chapter III contains results on the analysis of storm water, water samples and sediment of the marina. Chapter IV presents discussion and summary on the data."
