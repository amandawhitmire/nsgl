9,Abstract:,"Larry Collins, President of the San Francisco Community Fishing Association discusses the context, origins, and development of the fishing association. He describes the need for access to fish, markets, and infrastructure in order for working waterfronts to succeed. He explains that the fishing association was created in an effort to address these needs of the small boat fishermen in San Francisco as catch share programs posed challenges to this fleet. With the protection afforded to the association under the grant from the State of California, the association is thriving and serves as a cooperative model for west coast communities."
