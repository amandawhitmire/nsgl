9,Abstract:,"Demographic analyses can be quite useful for effectively managing elasmobranch fisheries. However, they require valid estimates of age-specific mortality and natality rates, in addition to information on the distribution, abundance, habits and reproduction of the population, to produce reliable estimates of population growth. In California, reliable estimates of age, growth, mortality, age at maturity, and fecundity are available only for the leopard shark, ""Triakis semifasciata"". Thus, it is possible to estimate reliably the life-history parameters necessary for a detailed demographic analysis of this species in central California. A size limit of 120 cm TL (estimated age 13 years), especially for female sharks, is tentatively proposed for the leopard shark fishery."
