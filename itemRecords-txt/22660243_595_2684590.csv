16,Abstract:,"In 2017, California Sea Grant (CSG) and University of California at Berkeley (UC Berkeley) were awarded three years of funding by the Wildlife Conservation Board (WCB) to conduct streamflow and coho salmon survival studies in Russian River tributaries. These studies are designed to aid in increasing streamflow in flow-impaired streams critical for the recovery of endangered coho salmon populations. With the assistance of this award, we are building upon previous research and an established monitoring infrastructure in the Russian River watershed, and are collecting and analyzing long-term datasets to determine which streamflow and related environmental metrics (dissolved oxygen, temperature, wetted volume) best predict summer survival of juvenile coho salmon. In addition, we are conducting sequential wet/dry mapping, snorkeling, and spawner surveys to document changes in wetted habitat conditions in relation to streamflow, fish distribution, flow augmentations and other streamflow improvement projects over the three years of the grant. The intention of this work is to aid resource managers and recovery partners in the prioritization, design, and evaluation of stream flow enhancement projects, allow optimization of the timing and quantity of water released from upstream storage ponds and wells, inform instream flow recommendations and water policy, and support planning for emergency actions in times of drought. This report includes a summary of the first year of progress for WCB award WC-1663CR during the period of May 1, 2017 – April 30, 2018."
