10,Abstract:,"Standard management practices on commercial crustacean species, including restrictions on catch (number of individuals), size (minimum length or width), sex (males only), effort (number of fishing days), location, seasons (usually nonbreeding), and gear, are usually ad hoc measures aimed at protecting the reproductive output of the stock. Each of these practices may increase the overall impact of parasites on future yield if fishing increases the relative abundance of parasitized hosts. This may occur when parasitized individuals grow more slowly, females are not fished but the infectious agent occurs predominantly on females, changed behavior of parasitized individuals reduces their rate of entry to traps, heavily parasitized geographic locations are less exploited, or infected individuals are released because they are unmarketable. Infectious organisms substantially impact some important crustacean fisheries and should be considered in management strategies. A simple fisheries model incorporates parasites; management practices and recruitment dynamics of both host and parasite are then varied. The common practice of releasing females is not advantageous when a fishery is affected by a parasite; retaining females in the catch is preferable in most cases. Treating or culling infected females may be advisable when host recruitment is closed."
