8,Abstract:,"Following the recently completed Ocean Resources Enhancement and Hatchery Program (OREHP) Evaluation Report (hereafter “Evaluation”; California Sea Grant 2017), input from public stakeholders of the OREHP was needed to inform recommendations and decisions to be made by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) with advice from a 10-member Ocean Resources Enhancement Advisory Panel (OREAP) regarding the future of the program. The goal of this project was, therefore, to gather public opinion on the social values and future direction of the OREHP from a diversity of stakeholder groups in Southern California.This goal was met by (1) developing materials for soliciting and collecting informed public input; (2) gathering public input from a diversity of stakeholder groups throughout Southern California by (a) administering anonymous surveys and (b) encouraging public comment at three town hall meetings, and (c) issuing a call for post-town hall public comment for stakeholders who could not attend the meetings; and (3) summarizing public input (this report). Three town hall meetings, conducted in June 2018 in Goleta, San Pedro and San Diego, California, hosted 118 attendees, of which 46 provided verbal public comment and 101 completed anonymous surveys. An additional 77 people submitted post-town hall comments by phone, mail and email throughout June and July 2018. Since the people who attended the town hall meetings were generally different than those who provided post-town hall comments, information from surveys completed during the town halls and post-town hall comments was combined and used quantitatively when feasible (n=178 participants). The open-ended public comments delivered verbally by participants at town hall meetings and post-town hall comments were used qualitatively to provide a deeper understanding of the motivations and opinions underlying responses (n=123 participants who provided sets of open-ended comments)."
