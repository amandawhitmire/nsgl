10,Abstract:,"Dynamic-â€‹transient loading effects from extreme storm waves and earthquakes can have important influences on the nonlinear ultimate limit state performance of fixed off-shore platforms. Recorded and synthetic storm wave and earthquake time histories have been used to develop loading time histories acting on template-type platforms having natural periods in the range of 1 to 5 sec. The interactions of these loading histories with the dynamic, nonlinear, hysteretic performance characteristics of idealized systems have been analyzed."
