11,Abstract:,"The policies of the Occupation era profoundly affected Japanese society and political organization. This paper discusses several dimensions of the Occupation policies and postwar Japanese political economy, and raises some interpretive questions about planning and related economic and social policies pursued. Some little-noted aspects of these policies and how they were administered prior to restoration of sovereignty are explored, and a few suggestions are offered as to how those policies and impacts were related functionally to the institutions and style of planning intervention adopted by the autonomous Japanese government after 1951-1952."
