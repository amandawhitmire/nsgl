10,Abstract:,"Interest in microsatellites and AFLPs as genetic markers of choice for population and ecological genetics studies is steadily growing, as is the demand for automated sequencers. Sample throughput and cost have become the focus of many researchers when deciding which detection technique to use for scoring fragment polymorphisms. This article outlines a protocol for using a freely downloadable fragment analysis software package (STRand) together with a 96+4 RapidLoad membrane comb to increase throughput of samples for fragment analysis on ABI sequencers without costly upgrades from the manufacturer. The method will work with ABI 373 and 377 sequencers, and provides a cheap alternative to increase the throughput of fragment analysis with only slight modification to existing protocols."
