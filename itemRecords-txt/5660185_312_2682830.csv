12,Abstract:,"This biennial report presents the results of research activities undertaken by the California Sea Grant College during fiscal years 1990-92. It is meant to be a technical record of our accomplishments for use by individuals in academia, government, and industry. This publication contains only reports of completed projects (as opposed to descriptions of work in progress). It thus forms an important historical record of program achievement and an important document in terms of program accountability.â€‹ For readers unfamiliar with our program, the California Sea Grant College is the largest of 29 Sea Grant programs underway in more than half the nation's states. Its purpose is clearly stated in the 1966 National Sea Grant College and Program Act responsible for its creation: ''to increase the understanding, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of the nation's ocean and coastal resources by providing assistance to promote a strong educational base, responsive research and training activities, and broad and prompt dissemination of knowledge and techniques."" California's Sea Grant College is administered by the University of California and is headquartered at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, part of the University of California, San Diego."
