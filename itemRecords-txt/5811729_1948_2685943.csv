10,Abstract:,"Commercial abalone mariculture facilities in southern California have been affected by a sabellid polychaete that infests shells of red abalones, among other gastropods. The worm has been described as a new genus and species, ""Terebrasabella heterouncinata""â€‹. Here researchers report initial observations on its life cycle, mode and rate of infestation, effect on abalone shell growth, and host specificity. These sabellid worms may have a unique mechanism to promote tube formation by the secretory activities of the mantle, thereby evading the primary apertural fouling defense mechanism of their hosts."
