11,Abstract:,invasive species
12,,"Case Study: an aquarium organism that was not disposed of properly. Caulerpa taxifolia, a green seaweed, has invaded southern California, south-eastern Australia, and the Mediterranean Sea. In 2004, the alga covered over 200 kilometers of coastline in the Mediterranean. Dubbed the ""killer alga"" because of its major ecosystem and economic impacts to tourism and fisheries, Mediterranean populations rapidly became too widespread to eradicate. In California and southern Australia, millions of dollars are being spent to eradicate this weed and monitor for new outbreaks. All three invasions are believed to be the result of releases of ""Caulerpa toxifolia"" from salt-water aquaria. If the unwanted ""C. taxifolia"" had been disposed of properly, these invasions would have been prevented! This DVD includes a public service announcement and animated short (approximately 3 minutes), a Caulerpa key, and alternatives to release."
