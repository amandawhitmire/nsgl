11,Abstract:,"Starvation has been suggested as one of the main causes of larval fish mortality. To better understand the early nutritional requirements of California halibut ""Paralichthys californicus"", researchers investigated the effect of the timing of first feeding - 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 days post hatch (dph) - on laboratory-​reared larvae. Survival of larvae initially fed at 3, 4, or 5 dph was similar, although growth differed. The point of no return (when starvation is irreversible) was reached at 7 dph. Food deprivation also resulted in changes of body morphometrics and alterations in the organization of the digestive system. However, changes appear to be, at best, species-​specific, suggesting there is no apparent universal morphometric index to evaluate larval nutritional status. For California halibut, a combination of morphometric and histological parameters can be used to evaluate nutritional condition."
