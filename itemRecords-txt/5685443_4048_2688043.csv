12,Abstract:,"The environmental etiologic agents responsible for the induction of autoimmune diseases are generally unknown. One possible example of chemical etiology occurred in Spain in 1981, in which a mass poisoning resulted from the consumption of oil adulterated with aniline; this public health illness was termed the Toxic Oil Syndrome. The major suspect toxicants are fatty acid anilides, and the manifestations of toxicity are at least partially mediated by the immune system. Oxidative mechanisms may be important in the pathogenesis of chemically-​induced autoimmune disease, including the TOS. This paper presents data demonstrating the lung to be a target organ in mice exposed to oleic anilide through their diet. Since oxygenases are well described targets of oxidant stress, lipoxygenase activity of lung epithelia was examined for alterations by dietary oleic anilide. 12-HETE was chosen for consideration, since it was not yet studied in the context of the TOS."
