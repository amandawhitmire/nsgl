10,Abstract:,Many natural marine halogenated compounds are thought to be involved in chemical defense roles to keep predators away from a particular organism. In many cases these compounds are also of pharmacological interest. Marine natural products chemists have long invoked the role of haloperoxidases in the biogenesis of the halogenated marine natural products. Marine haloperoxidases have now been isolated and purified to homogeneity; thus the scope of this review article entails the reactivity and characterizatio​n of the marine haloperoxidases​.
