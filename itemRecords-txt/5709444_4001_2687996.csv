11,Abstract:,"The salt water culture of an unidentified fungus separated from an Indo-Pacific marine sponge has yielded new tetraketide natural products, demethyl nectriapyrone A and nectriapyrone B. These alpha-pyrone containing compounds are analagous to nectriapyrone, previously reported from a terrestrial fungus."
