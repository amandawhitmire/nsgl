12,Abstract:,"This has been the Year of the Ocean, a national celebration of the heritage and future of our seas. It is a celebration in which the California Sea Grant College Program has been pleased to play a role. The period from July 1, 1984 through June 30, 1985 was designated as the Year of the Ocean by the President and endorsed by a joint resolution of Congress. The designation was made just one year after the President had proclaimed our offshore waters as the ""Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States of America."" This proclamation gave America sovereign rights over an enormous area of the sea adjacent to U.S. coasts, including areas around U.S.-controlled islands in the Pacific and the Caribbean. In this summary of the activities of California Sea Grant from 1982 to 1984, we examine how research funded by the program is contributing to basic knowledge necessary to fully realize the potential of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The California program—largest​ of 30 Sea Grant programs in the United States and Puerto Rico—is a statewide partnership of government, industry, colleges and universities, and the public. Its mission is to promote the sound development of our nation's marine resources through research, educational programs, and advisory services. As you will see from this report, one of the primary aims of California Sea Grant is to support practical research that has the potential to be economically beneficial to the state and the nation."
