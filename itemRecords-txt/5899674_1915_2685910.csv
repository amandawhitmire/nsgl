12,Abstract:,"Researchers measured polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in the water column of San Diego Bay with an in situ water sampling system capable of processing large volumes of water. The sampling strategy allowed detection of ultralow levels of chemical contaminants so that a meaningful comparison with the discharge limits specified in the California Ocean Plan could be made. Except for one sample collected near the bay mouth, all samples contained higher PCB concentrations than the 30-day average limit."
