10,Abstract:,"During severe storm or hurricane conditions, wave-induced loading on submarine pipelines can be large enough to detach some of the placed pipes from the seafloor, causing them to move or float to great distances with the ocean currents. This paper addresses the mechanical stability of the pipe/soil system under wave action, in particular, the conditions that lead to pipeline detachment or breakout from the seafloor under hydrodynamic wave loading. An experimental breakout force-time power law is obtained and compared to available theoretical breakout models."
