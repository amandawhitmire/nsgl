10,Abstract:,"Successful expression of a cloned gene is a powerful tool used for many purposes, including analysis of protein function and organism physiology. Regulated gene expression systems offer further functionality by providing inducible control of the expressed gene of interest. Most inducible expression vectors have been developed for enteric bacteria. For use in other bacteria, broad-​host-​range vectors must be constructed to include an inducible system. This work describes the construction of two gram-negative broad-​host-​range expression vectors, and their analysis in ""E. coli"" and ""Xanthomonas campestris."""
