11,Abstract:,"The difference in morphology between Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") zoeae from Alaska and California waters was documented to determine if the variation is attributable to environmental influences. First-stage zoeae from Alaska have significantly longer carapace spines than zoeae from central California. Ovigerous female crabs collected in SE Alaska were held at 1 deg, 5 deg, 10 deg, and 15 deg C until hatching. All eggs and crabs held at 1 deg died; egg mortalitly averaged less than 2% at other temperatures. Embryonic development rate was inversely related to temperature. Spine lengths differed at all temperatures with longer spines occurring at lower temperatures. This study questions the use of spine lengths to distinguish similar larval species."
