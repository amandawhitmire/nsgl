10,Abstract:,"Pentachlorophen​ol (PCP), a widely used biocide, is an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation​; it is thought to destroy the electrochemical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane produced by electron transport and required for ATP synthesis. A wood preservative, PCP is introduced into coastal waters from wood-treatment plant effluents, wood pilings, jetties, and antifouling paints. Due to the widespread use of PCP in California coastal regions, the red abalone (""Haliotis rufescens"") may potentially be impacted. This study determined the disposition and biotransformati​on of PCP in the red abalone."
