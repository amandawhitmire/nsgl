12,Abstract:,"In an effort to sort out the origins of alpha-MSH acetylation mechanisms, this study of the intermediate pituitaries of the chondrostean fishes, ""Acipenser transmontanus"" (the white sturgeon) and ""Polyodon spathula"" (the paddlefish) was made. The presence of N-acetylated forms of alpha-MSH in the pituitaries of representatives of the two extant genera of chondrostean fish coupled with the observation that N-acetylated forms of alpha-MSH are present in the pituitaries of cladistian and neopterygian fishes indicates that the alpha-MSH specific N-acetylation mechanism evolved prior to the radiation of the Actinopterygii."
