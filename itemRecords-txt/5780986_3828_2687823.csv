10,Abstract:,"In this study, the authors compared resistance to planthopper herbivory between the Willapa Bay (WB) smooth cordgrass population, which has not recently experienced insect herbivory, and the San Francisco Bay and Maryland populations, which have historically been exposed. Pacific smooth cordgrass reduces native shorebird feeding habitats, threatens oystering grounds, and clogs flood control channels. Implications of genetic differentiation among populations for the prospects of biological control of this noxious invader were studied. Multiple factors, including a founder effect, further loss of herbivore tolerance, and herbivore preference for WB plants, appear to account for the reduced planthopper resistance in the WB population."
