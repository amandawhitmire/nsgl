12,Abstract:,"Micro-organisms interact with metals in a variety of ways that lead to the accumulation of the metal on or in the cell and the removal of the metal from solution. Extracellular metal precipitation results from the production of a metabolite that combines with a metal ion, metal complex, or other metal-â€‹containing compound forming a solid phase (i.e. insoluble precipitate). Biological based technologies for the detoxification and removal of a variety of metals and radionuclides may be useful in the treatment of waste and for the remediation of pollution (Tebo, 1995). The authors developed a family of technologies, referred to as, MOP-UP, that employ the accumulation of metals by micro-organisms from a variety of different media coupled with separation and recovery of those metals."
