11,Abstract:,"This paper provides an overview of the design, structure, implementation, and use of the CTD (conductivity-​temperature-​ depth) Oceanographic Rendering and Analysis Laboratory (CORAL). CORAL uses new technologies to provide a user-friendly environment for the archiving, browsing, selection, analysis, and rendering of global geophysical datasets. It also provides the user with a convenient way to add new analysis functions while seamlessly retaining all the advantages of the CORAL system."
