12,Abstract:,"The identification, characterizatio​n, and application of growth-​promoting factors in fisheries and aquaculture require a thorough understanding of the physiological mechanisms that regulate the growth and development of fish and shellfish. Commercial application will require close cooperative and collaborative relations among university researchers, industry, and government. It is only through such a concerted enterprise that practical application will be realized. The National Sea Grant College Program was established to foster innovative and responsible development of marine resources. It is, therefore, appropriate that the Sea Grant program, through its Sea Grant Colleges, take the lead in conducting needed research on the regulation of fish growth and development. This document presents a proposal for a national research initiative designed to provide the basis through which the United States can meet the expanding seafood requirements of its citizens."
