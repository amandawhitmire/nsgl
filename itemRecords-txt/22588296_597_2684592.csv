10,Abstract:,"Rationale: Fisheries management is predicated on surveys that monitor changes in population levels. Biased and imprecise surveys can lead to uncertain population estimates that can complicate management strategies. In some cases, only fishery-​dependent data are available which require standardization to account for changes in catch per unit effort (CPUE) unrelated to fish abundance (Maunder and Punt 2004). Standardization of fishery-​independent survey data is often necessary as well, particularly for design-based surveys. Surveys that miss key habitats, such as rocky reefs that cannot be trawled, and deep waters beyond the reach of a survey, increase the potential for biased estimates of relative abundance and raise concerns about the magnitude of biomass that may be cryptic to standard surveys. Bias correction is difficult with inconsistently biased CPUE indices and will result in biased population assessments."
11,,"Objectives: We designed a simulation framework to evaluate bias and imprecision from density-​based sampling and gear saturation and assess their impact on the relationship between survey CPUE and relative abundance. Several of the simulation parameters and assumptions are informed by a case study, the Southern California Shelf Rockfish Hook and Line Survey (hereafter, “California hook-​and-​line survey”) which targets several demersal species of the genus Sebastes in rocky habitats in the Southern California Bight. Simulation characteristics such as survey design; number of sites; number of hooks deployed; population sizes aimed at reflecting overfished, rebuilding, and rebuilt stocks; and exploration of how multi-species competition interacts with gear saturation were included to improve the analysis of data collected on the California hookand-line survey but also provide useful insight for more generalized applications (Cadigan 2012). We conclude the analysis by comparing simulation results with empirical data collected on this survey."
