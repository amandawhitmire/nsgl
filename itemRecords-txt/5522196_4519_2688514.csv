10,Abstract:,"This paper describes a simple, fracture-​mechanics-​based test method for determining the long-term susceptibility of fiber-​reinforced composites to failure by environmental cracking. The technique retains the simplicity of constant-strain testing while improving the accuracy of crack-​growth-​rate data. The low cost, small size, and simplicity of this technique may reduce the expense of long-term multi-specimen environmental testing."
