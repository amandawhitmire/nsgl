9,Abstract:,"Florida has one of the longest coastlines in the United States and over 16 million people who live in close proximity to the ocean. Nearly 80 percent of the state's gross revenue is generated in the counties bordering the coastline, with a coastal economy ranking second only to California, at $13.04 billion. Coastal natural resources are biologically diverse, productive and provide a myriad of vital economic services to society. The coastline includes vast expanses of mangrove, coral reef, sea grass, salt marsh and oyster beds. It supports economically important aquaculture, commercial harvesting of aquatic products and one of the nation's largest recreational boating and fishing industries. With tens of millions of people living in the coastal zone, there are multiple issues related to freshwater demand, nutrient runoff from urban and agricultural areas, habitat loss and fragmentation, and competition for space. Along the coast, homes and businesses are built just a few feet above sea level. People living in these areas are periodically impacted by hazards including flooding, storm surge and hurricane force winds. They are also at high risk from sea-level rise and some areas of the Florida coast already are experiencing increased flooding at high tide compared to decades in the past."
