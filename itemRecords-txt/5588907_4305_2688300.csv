12,Abstract:,"The marine natural porducts manoalide, isolated from the sponge ""Luffariella variabilis"", luffariellolide from the sponge ""Luffariella"" sp., and scalaradial from the sponge ""Cacospongia mollior"", are potent anti-​inflammatory agents and inhibitors of various secreted forms of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Several mechanisms of chemical inactiviation of PLA2 by manoalide have been suggested. This paper demonstrates that the primary reaction involved in the inactivation of bee venom PLA2 by manoalide, luffariellolide​, and scalaradial is Schiff base (imine) formation and that enzyme activity can be significantly recovered if the drug-enzyme adducts are treated with hydroxylamine."
