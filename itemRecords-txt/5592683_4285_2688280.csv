12,Abstract:,"There is growing evidence that a large variety of microorganisms can accelerate corrosion reactions of many materials in different environments. The goal of this research is to determine the role of microorganisms, corrosion products and mass transport on the corrosion kinetics of copper alloys exposed to natural seawater. The corrosion kinetics of Cu alloys, which corrode in the active state, are much more complicated than those of stainless steels and Ti, which are passive state, even in the absence of microorganisms since the anodic reaction for the Cu alloys is under mixed charge transfer and mass transport control."
