11,Abstract:,"For nearly two decades, California Sea Grant’s Russian River Salmon and Steelhead Monitoring Program at the University of California has been monitoring endangered and threatened fish populations in order to provide science-based information to stakeholders and support species recovery efforts.We are happy to report that we were able to adapt to the challenges presented by the pandemic and local wildfires to complete most of our monitoring activities this year. This update and survey provides a brief overview of outcomes. Detailed seasonal reports are available at caseagrant.ucsd​.edu/coho-​reports. This work would not be possible without the support of our partners, including public resource agencies, non-profit organizations, and thousands of private landowners throughout the watershed. Special thanks to all the streamside landowners who grant us access permission!"
