10,Abstract:,"An investigation of a sponge rich in psammaplin derivatives provides some insight into the biogenesis of this group of amino acid derivatives. Accompanying psammpalin A were a new cysteine dimer, prepsammaplin A, and three new bromotyrosine-​cysteine derivatives, psammaplins B, C, and D. Two other compounds were isolated which appear to be bromotyrosine derivatives. Psammaplin D showed antimicorbial and mild tyrosine kinase inhibition activity."
