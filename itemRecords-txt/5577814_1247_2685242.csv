10,Abstract:,"Oil and gas resources are not the only mineral assets of the outer continental shelf. An abundant variety of nonfuel mineral deposits have also been identified. Examples include sand and gravel in the New York bight, Beaufort Sea, and in areas offshore of California and Hawaii; placer deposits containng chrome, gold, platinum, titanium, and other heavy minerals; phosphorites along the southeastern U.S. margin and the coast of Southern California; manganese nodules on the Blake Plateau; cobalt crusts in areas around Hawaii; and marine polymetallic sulfides (MPS) in the Gorda Ridge area. Although these OCS nonfuel minerals are currently of only minor economic importance (as compared to OCS oil and gas resources), interest in them has grown markedly in recent years, and efforts have begun to clarify procedures for their exploration and development. However, most OCS nonfuel minerals are not commercially exploitable at present."
