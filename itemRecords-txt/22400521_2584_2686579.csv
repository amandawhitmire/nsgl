13,Abstract:,To measure fouling pressure it is necessary to measure the availability of larvae in the plankton and their supply to the surface. The first part of this chapter highlights the methods to measure this and the second part gives details on how to measure the settlement behavior of the larvae when they encounter a surface. Behavioral measurements have potential as a bioassay for nonbiocidal coatings.
