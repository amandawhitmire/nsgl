10,Abstract:,"Participants in the U.S. west coast groundfish trawl fishery are required to maintain logbook records that provide a detailed set of species, catch, and effort data with broad temporal and spatial coverage. The authors used a geographic information system to compare catch data collected from the Oregon commercial trawl fishery with data from U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service research cruises conducted at the same time in the same area. Patterns of distribution and relative abundance derived from logbook data closely resembled those from National Marine Fisheries Service. Graphical and statistical analyses indicated that information derived from logbooks can augment research data and improve estimates of the distribution and relative abundance of commercial fish species."
