10,Abstract:,"Spores of marine ""Bacillus"" sp. strain SG-1 were studied for possible use in metal removal and recovery applications. Surface characteristics of SG-1 spores were examined, and divalent copper adsorption by SG-1 spores was investigated. SG-1 spores actively oxidize divalent manganese and cobalt over a wide range of environmental conditions and are naturally resistant to a variety of physical and chemical stresses which may be encountered in a waste stream or polluted environment. SG-1 spores have both a high affinity and a high capacity for divalent copper and may be wellsuited for solving problems where mixed metals occur."
