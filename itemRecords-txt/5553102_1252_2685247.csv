10,Abstract:,"Marine octocorals of the order Gorgonacea, the sea whips and sea fans (phylum Cnidaria) are abundant, chemically-rich invertebrates found in the reef and shallow-water habitats of the Caribbean Sea. Four new diterpenoid arabinose glycosides, fuscosides A and D, have been isolated from the Caribbean gorgonian ""Eunicea fusca."" Fuscosides A and B are effective topical antiinflammator​y agents with potencies equivalent to indomethacin and manoalide. Fuscoside B selectively inhibits the synthesis of leukotrienes LTB4 and LTC4, but not PGE2, in the mouse peritoneal macrophage, suggesting it is a selective inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis."
