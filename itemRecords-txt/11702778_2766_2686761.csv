19,Abstract:,"Low-density polyethylene (PE) passive samplers containing performance reference compounds (PRCs)were deployed at multiple depths in two urban coastal marine locations to estimate dissolved concentrationsof hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs), including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) andits metabolites, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, and polybrominated flame retardants. PE samplerspre-loaded with PRCs were deployed at the surface, mid-column, and near bottom at sites representingthe nearshore continental shelf off southern California (Santa Monica Bay, USA) and a megacommercial port (Los Angeles Harbor). After correcting for fractional equilibration using PRCs, concentrationsranged up to 100 pg L1 for PCBs and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 500 pg L1 forDDMU and 300 pg L1 for DDNU, and to 1000 pg L1 for p,p0-DDE. Seawater concentrations of DDTsand PCBs increased with depth, suggesting that bed sediments serve as the source of water column HOCsin Santa Monica Bay. In contrast, no discernable pattern between surface and near-bottom concentrationsin Los Angeles Harbor was observed, which were also several-fold lower (DDTs: 45–300 pg L1, PCBs: 5–50 pg L1) than those in Santa Monica Bay (DDTs: 2–1100 pg L1, PCBs: 2–250 pg L1). Accumulation bymussels co-deployed with the PE samplers at select sites was strongly correlated with PE-estimated seawaterconcentrations, providing further evidence that these samplers are a viable alternative for monitoringof HOC exposure. Fractional equilibration observed with the PRCs increased with decreasing PRCmolar volume indicating the importance of target compound physicochemical properties when estimatingwater column concentrations using passive samplers in situ."
