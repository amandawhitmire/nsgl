9,Abstract:,"All modern sturgeons spawn in fresh water, but the environment in which they reside during most of their adult life may differ. The white sturgeon ""Acipenser transmontanus"" is a semi-anadromous fish: it spends most of its adult life in coastal marine environments and migrates into fresh water to spawn. The object of this study was to determine the dynamics of white sturgeon plasma and urine electrolyte concentrations during changes in environmental salinity. It was hoped that light would be shed on the species' osmoregulatory mechanisms and its life history relationships with other sturgeon species."
