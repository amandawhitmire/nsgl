11,Abstract:,"The sublethal actions of the piscicide, 3-​trifluoromethyl-​ 4-nitrophenol (TFM) were characterized in red abalone and owl limpets by in vivo 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The goals were (i) to confirm that TFM acts as an oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler in intact mollusks and (ii) to compare the potentially adverse effects of TFM in tow species of molluscs that experience very different levels of environmental stress. This was achieved by determination of concentrations of phosphoarginine​, inorganic phosphate, and ATP, and arginine kinase forward rate constants throughout a 5-h exposure to a sublethal concentration of TFM, followed by a 5-h recovery period."
