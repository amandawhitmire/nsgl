10,Abstract:,"If ecologist Lee Kats of Pepperdine University had his way, every last Louisiana red swamp crayfish that has invaded California would be made into the world's largest crawfish etouffee and served piping hot to whoever would eat it. The Louisiana red swamp crayfish-yes, the same one that is a centerpiece of Cajun cuisine-is a pest species here in the Golden State, unwanted because it is elbowing out native crayfish, snails, salamanders and frogs. Think of it as the Viking of the crayfish world- hearty, strong and aggressive, especially on foreign soil."
