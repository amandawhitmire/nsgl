11,Abstract:,"In recent decades, biofilter systems have been constructed within southern California by individual developers, non-profit organizations, universities, municipalities, transportation authorities, and water districts, but there has been no list or database available that compiles all known biofilter site locations, along with the quantification of their ecological attributes or the ecosystem services provided by these systems. Here we consolidate known/publicall​y available information for existing biofilter sites of Los Angeles County into an easily accessible database."
