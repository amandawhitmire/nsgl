12,Abstract:,"The transfer and introduction, inadvertent and planned, by human being of living organisms into aquatic ecosystems has a long history. In a number of cases, introductions have had commercial benefits as well as scientific value; on the other hand, there are many instances of problematical, even detrimental, environmental impacts. With the movement of species from one ecosystem to another for the growing aquaculture industries around the nation and with the use of genetically-â€‹altered microorganisms for a variety of uses, prediction of the ecological implications is critical if we are to portect the integrity of our aquatic environments. As many case histories have shown, such predictions can be extraordinarily complicated. This book examines a number of case studies of translocating aquatic plant and animal species in the context of focusing on issues that scientists, entrepreneurs, and habitat and resource managers must take into account. The book's 27 papers are grouped into two sections, risks and impacts and risk reduction and safety. The papers in Part I of this volume discuss the risks associated with releases, introductions, and transfers of living organisms into aquatic ecosystems and resulting impacts. Part II focuses on management approaches relative to translocation of living organisms that can be applied for reduction of risk to aquatic biota and their habitats, enhancement of food production, and protection of human health."
