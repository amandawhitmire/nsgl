8,Abstract:,"The international liner market consists of common carriers moving oceanborne trade consisting mostly of manufactured and semi-​manufactured goods. Almost all modern liner vessels are capable of carrying marine containers and most major liner operators in U.S. foreign trade operate fully cellular ships. The facilities in the U.S. used by liner operators are owned by public port authorities. Although there are hundreds of liner firms and ports worldwide, the top twenty handle the lion's share of the cargo. At the same time, hundreds more ocean carriers and ports exist. Therefore, there must be many small segments of the market that allow all these carriers and ports to exist. The needs of the liner operators, in terms of port facilities and services provided by public port authorities, are described here. To facilitate discussion, the liner market is first divided into three categories, each with different requirements. Finally, some conclusions are drawn as to the impact on coastal space utilization."
