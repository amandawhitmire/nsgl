11,Abstract:,"The movement of shallow-water, often estuarine, organisms across ocean basins and over continents as a consequence of human activities continues to be a major mechanism mediating biological invasions, often resulting from the release of seawater ballast from cargo vessels. One such invasion is now occurring in San Francisco Bay, California. In 1987 workers recognized that a small unknown bivalve mollusk, first collected in late 1986, had not been recorded previously from the bay. Its apparently sudden appearance and subsequent increase and spread prompted speculation that this clam had been recently introduced. The clams were subsequently identified as the Asian species ""Potamocorbula amurensis"" (Schrenck, 1867). Reported here are its establishment and rapid spread; the possible effects this clam may have on the benthic and planktonic communities of San Francisco Bay are discussed."
