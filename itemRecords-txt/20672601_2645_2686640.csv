14,Abstract:,"We investigate whether consumers are willing to pay for sustainability in seafood purchases. To do this, we estimate a demand model of seafood counter purchases using a product-level scanner dataset that includes data both before and after the implementation of an independent, non-profit, third party seafood advisory and sustainability label. The label ratings are based on seafood species, catch method, production method, and country of origin. The label presents sustainability information to consumers through the use of a traffic light label color-based system, where a color rating is assigned and labeled to each seafood stock-keeping unit. Green represents the best choices, yellow represents the “proceed with caution” choices, and red represents the worst choices. Using our panel dataset of individual seafood purchases, we estimate a random utility choice model (RUM) of consumer demand for seafood products. Each seafood product is defined as a bundle of attributes, including price, species, gear type, environmental contaminant advisory information, and sustainability rating color. Model identification comes from the partial and random implementation of the label system across the retail chain. Empirical results suggest that consumers perceive seafood as a differentiated product category with respect to sustainability labels. A second stage GLS regression of product characteristics on the RUM product fixed effects point estimates indicate that consumers prefer selective harvest methods, wild caught seafood, and U.S. caught seafood."
