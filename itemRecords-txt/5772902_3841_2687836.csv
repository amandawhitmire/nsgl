9,Abstract:,"Many halogenated natural products have been isolated from marine organisms, some of pharmacological interest. The marine haloperoxidases are thought to be involved in the biosynthesis of these natural products. This article covers recent developments pertaining to: the nature of the oxidized halogen intermediate, the critical amino acid residues for enzyme catalysts, and the nature of the vanadium site, among others."
