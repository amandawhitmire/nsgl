17,Abstract:,"The cross-shore evolution of nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs) from 8-m depth to shore was observed by a dense thermistor array and ADCP. Isotherm oscillations spanned much of the water column at a variety of periods. At times, NLIWs propagated into the surfzone, decreasing temperature by ’18C in 5 min. When stratification was strong, temperature variability was strong and coherent from 18- to 6-m depth at semi- diurnal and harmonic periods. When stratification weakened, temperature variability decreased and was incoherent between 18- and 6-m depth at all frequencies. At 8-m depth, onshore coherently propagating NLIW events had associated rapid temperature drops (DT) up to 1.78C, front velocity between 1.4 and 7.4 cm s21, and incidence angles between 258 and 238. Front position, DT, and two-layer equivalent height zIW of four events were tracked upslope until propagation terminated. Front position was quadratic in time, and normalized DT and zIW both decreased, collapsing as a linearly decaying function of normalized cross-shore distance. Front speed and deceleration are consistent with two-layer upslope gravity current scalings. During NLIW rundown, near-surface cooling and near-bottom warming at 8-m depth coincide with a critical gradient Richardson number, indicating shear-driven mixing."
