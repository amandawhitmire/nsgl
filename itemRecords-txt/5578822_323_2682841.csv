13,Abstract:,"This conference is a sequel to the Workshop on the Fate and Impact of Marine Debris (1984), the first meeting of its kind to address the issue of marine debris as an international problem and its impact on living marine resources. The size and scope of the second conference make it necessary to publish the proceedings in two volumes. The first volume includes the full text of 5 overview papers, and the full text of 40 papers presented in the technical sessions on sources, entanglement and ghost fishing, and ingestion. The second volume includes the text of 31 papers presented in the technical sessions on economics, technology, law and policy, and education. It also includes the reports of the eight working groups and abstracts of the poster and video presentations."
