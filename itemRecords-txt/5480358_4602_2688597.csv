8,Abstract:,"The hypothesis that thyroid function in fish may be altered by photoperiod arose, in part, from observations of seasonal changes in thyroid activity. Cyclic changes in thyroid function follow a variety of patterns in teleosts, and they remain generally poorly understood in terms of how they are regulated and what physiological purposes they serve. In some instances, seasonal alterations in thyroid function coincide with sexual development or temperature changes, but in others it appears that photoperiod could be the primary environmental cue for thyroid seasonality. In this report, seasonal and diurnal cycles in thyroid function in teleost fish are examined as they may relate to photoperiodic control mechanisms. The experimental evidence implicating photoperiodic regulation of thyroid activity in fish is summarized, and one means by which the environmental variable could exert influences at the level of the thyroid follicles is considered."
