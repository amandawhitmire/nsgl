10,Abstract:,"This paper outlines an ongoing project to examine the prohibited species catch (PSC) avoidance behavior of catcher processor vessels in the Bering Sea flatfish fisheries under the current regulatory system of PSC and target quotas and spatial closures. We describe the history of the fisheries and examine the nature of the incentives provides by the regulatory system. We then develop a random utility model of fishing location choice that allows us to uncover the implicit tradeoffs fishermen make between target and bycatch species and show how this model can be estimated using haul level data provided by the North Pacific Groundfish Observer Program. We then describe how this specification can be extended to shed light on a number of important policy considerations, including the efficacy of a voluntary bycatch avoidance program and the impacts of spatial closures."
