12,Abstract:,"Using homologous molecular probes, researchers examined thermal acclimation and stress in the American lobster, ""Homarus americanus"". Following acclimation of lobsters to ambient and cold temperatures, the authors determined whether acute temperature shifts over equivalent intervals would elicit analogous signs of protein denaturation such as heat shock protein and polyubiquitin expression."
