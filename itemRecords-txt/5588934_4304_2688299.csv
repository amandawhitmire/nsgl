10,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study was to determine the nature of intracellular pH and Ca2+ shifts during the acrosome reaction (AR) in ""Sicyonia ingentis"" sperm. A previous study showed that the intracellular pH decreases almost a full pH unit during the AR. The question addressed here is whether filament formation is a direct consequence of the pHi decrease during the egg factor- induced AR. Also examined in this study is the involvement of Ca2+ fluxes in the AR, which have not been determined for capacitated ""S. ingentis"" sperm. Of special interest was the role of the egg protease in inducting sperm filament formation. Unexpected results were obtained, as Ca2+ levels were unusually high in unreacted sperm and no Ca2+ flux was observed upon induction of the AR. Also, neither acrosomal exocytosis nor filament formation appeared to be a direct consequence of the pHi decrease. The implications of these findings are discussed."
