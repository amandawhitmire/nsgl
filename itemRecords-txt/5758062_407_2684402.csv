9,Abstract:,"Native to Europe, the green crab, ""Carcinus maenas,"" was introduced to eastern North America in the early 19th century and since has become established in only three other parts of the world: Australia; South Africa; and, most recently, California. In California, it was first noted in San Francisco Bay in 1990 and, soon thereafter, in Bodega Harbor, Bolinas Lagoon, Tomales Bay, and Drake's Estero. Reported here is the arrival of the green crab in Humboldt Bay in northern California."
