8,Abstract:,"An engaging array of alkyne-​containing natural products are emerging from marine sponges. A collection of ""Xestospongia"" sp. obtained from Mele Bay in the Republic of Vanuatu was pursued because its crude extract was active in pharmacological pre-screens. The structures of three long chain polyeneyne triols, melynes A, B, C, are established from degradation reactions, NMR data, and HREIMS data, and are reported here."
