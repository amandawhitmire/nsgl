13,,"Historically coined `lupus', a salmonid condition of unknown etiology described as early as 1958 is now known to have been proliferative kidney disease. Experiments reported here indicate that the infective stage of the parasite is present in California as early as May and peaks in late June; steady decline results in its disappearance by December even in fish in warm water. Preliminary studies on the etiology of this disease and implications for its control are noted."
