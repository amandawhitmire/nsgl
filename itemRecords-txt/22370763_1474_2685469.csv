21,Abstract:,"California’s coastal ecosystems are forecasted to undergo shifting ocean conditions due to climate change, some of whichmay negatively impact recreational and commercial fish populations. To understand if fish populations have the capacityto respond to multiple stressors, it is critical to examine interactive effects across multiple biological scales, from cellularmetabol​ism to species interactions. This study examined the effects of CO2-​acidification and hypoxia on two naturally cooccurringspec​ies, juvenile rockfish (genus Sebastes) and a known predator, cabezon (Scorpaenichthy​s marmoratus). Fisheswere exposed to two PCO2 levels at two dissolved oxygen (DO) levels: ~600 (ambient) and ~1600 (high) μatm PCO2 and8.0 (normoxic) and 4.5 mg l−1 DO (hypoxic) and assessments of cellular metabolism, prey behavior and predation mortalityrates were quantified after 1 and 3 weeks. Physiologically​, rockfish showed acute alterations in cellular metabolic enzymeactivity after 1 week of acclimation to elevated PCO2 and hypoxia that were not evident in cabezon. Alterations in rockfishenergy metabolism were driven by increases in anaerobic LDH activity, and adjustments in enzyme activity ratios of cytochromec oxidase and citrate synthase and LDH:CS. Correlated changes in rockfish behavior were also apparent after 1week of acclimation to elevated PCO2 and hypoxia. Exploration behavior increased in rockfish exposed to elevated PCO2and spatial analysis of activity indicated short-term interference with anti-predator responses. Predation rate after 1 weekincreased with elevated PCO2; however, no mortality was observed under the multiple-​stressor treatment suggesting negativeeffects on cabezon predators. Most noteworthy, metabolic and behavioral changes were moderately compensatedafte​r 3 weeks of acclimation, and predation mortality rates also decreased suggesting that these rockfish may be resilientto changes in environmental stressors predicted by climate models. Linking physiological and behavioral responses to multiplestresso​rs is vital to understand impacts on populations and community dynamics."
