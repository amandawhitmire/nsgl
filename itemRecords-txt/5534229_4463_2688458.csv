9,Abstract:,"The November 3 1988 issue of the ""New England Journal of Medicine"" alerted clinicians and medical personnel to the disease known as anisakiasis, caused by the ingestion of larvae belonging to the family Anisakidae, and pointed out that clinicians may be seeing an increase in the number of cases of anisakiasis as a result of the increase in the popularity of eating sushi, sashimi, ceviche and lightly smoked or grilled fish. Invading larvae penetrate the mucosa and submucosa of the gastrointestina​l tract and produce lesions characterized by a marked inflammatory response. This article describes biochemical and molecular studies on the proteins excreted or secreted by ""Anisakis"" larvae that are currently underway to help elucidate the role these proteins may play in the invasion process and the pathogenesis of anisakiasis."
