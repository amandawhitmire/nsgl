10,Abstract:,"Larvae of the specialist marine herbivore ""Alderia modesta"" settle and metamorphose in response to complex carbohydrates produced exclusively by the adult host alga ""Vaucheria longicaulis,"" but the natural cue cannot be detected in sea water by current methods of analytical chemistry. The simple carbohydrates mannitol and glucose, which are highly concentrated in ""V. longicaulis"" tissue, were tested as possible markers for the settlement cue in laboratory and field experiments. Results show that mannitol and glucose are indeed released and transported along with complex carbohydrates from ""V. longicaulis,"" and can be used to define patterns of distribution of the dissolved settlement cue on both spatial and temporal scales."
