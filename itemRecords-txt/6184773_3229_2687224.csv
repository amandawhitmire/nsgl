9,Abstract:,"In 1995 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enacted its first mandatory science-based Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation which was applied to the seafood industry. Domestic and international seafood processors conducting commerce in the USA must follow regulations which mandate training. The US-based Seafood HACCP Alliance developed a 3-day standardized training curriculum to introduce HACCP principles, seafood hazards (biological, chemical and physical), sanitation control procedures, FDA regulation, conducting a hazard analysis and developing a HACCP plan. In 2001 the HACCP Alliance developed an Internet-based seafood HACCP training course to provide the equivalent of the first two day's training in order to provide an alternative educational program in HACCP education that could be learned at the participant's own pace and convenience."
