10,Abstract:,"There have recently been several reports of increased hematocrit (Hct) and/or hemoglobin (Hb) levels during voluntary natural diving in Weddell seals. Whether the response is due to apnea per se or to some combined response of apnea, hypoxia, and exercise is of interest; elevated Hct is also seen in exercising racehorses that do not experience the same levels of hypoxia as diving seals. Northern elephant seals (""Mirounga angustirostris""​) exhibit long-duration sleep apnea (up to 40 min in adults) and provide an excellent model to study the animals' response to quiet voluntary apnea. Evidence reported here suggests that the response of increased Hct does not require the seal to be exercising, is produced quickly after the onset of apnea, and is not hypoxia-​dependent."
