10,Abstract:,"Animals that live in seawater are surrounded by a medium that contains organic nutrients in dilute solution. Recent data are summarized which illustrate that larval stages of marine invertebrates are adapted morphologically​, physiologically​, and biochemically to take nutritional advantage of the dissolved organic carbon in their environment. New evidence for the importance of dissolved organic matter to metazoans is presented by showing that larval forms can increase in biomass, even in the absence of particulate foods."
