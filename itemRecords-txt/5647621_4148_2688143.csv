11,Abstract:,"Marine organisms represent a new resource for the discovery of novel anti-​inflammatory agents. Marine natural products have been studied as pharmacological probes to explore the various mechanisms by which been venom phospholipase A2 (byPLA2) can be inactivated. The purposes of this report are to identify the biochemical factors controlling the mechanism by which sesquiterpene furanoic acid, isolated from soft corals of the genus ""Sinularia"", inhibits byPLA2 and to describe the inactivation kinetics and reversibility of the drug-enzyme complex."
