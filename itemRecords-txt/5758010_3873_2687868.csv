13,Abstract:,"Despite the many differences between marine and terrestrial organisms, there are many shared physiological and biochemical processes in these classes of life forms. The oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as arachidonic acid (AA), to biologically active compounds is one such process. In a study of selected red and green marine algae to determine the relative capacity of various organisms to metabolize AA, the authors detected high levels of AA metabolic activity in a green algal species, ""Anadyomene stellata"". This alga is frequently found in shallow marine habitats exposed to high herbivory, yet does not appear to be preyed upon, suggesting that it is fairly unpalatable. ""A. stellata"" is an attractive species in which to study PUFA metabolism, the biological roles of its metabolites, and their possible pharmaceutical applications."
