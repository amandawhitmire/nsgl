11,,"The University of Hawaii's Marine Option Program is an experiential education program for undergraduates. Students earn a certificate by completing a core of marine courses along with an internship or independent study project of their choice. One theme prepares students to conduct scientific surveys of Hawaii's coral reef ecosystems. Courses are offered in scuba, first aid, CPR and the field identification of fishes, invertebrates and algae. Those who complete this instruction participate in a workshop on transecting methods. Lectures and field work cover biology, sampling, analysis and methods. Students train in six-member teams which include a dive captain and safety diver. Graduates of the transecting workshop have made valuable contributions to baseline surveys; many have received academic credit or employment based on this training."
