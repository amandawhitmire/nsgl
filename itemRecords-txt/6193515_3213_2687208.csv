11,Abstract:,"Nearshore waves and currents transport and mix runoff pollution that often drains directly into the surfzone. However, tracer dispersion in the surfzone is poorly understood. Rates of horizontal dispersion in the nearshore (within a few 100m of the shoreline, depths less than about 5 m) are estimated using drifter observations obtained during the HB06 field experiment (Fall 2006) at Huntington Beach CA. A cross-shore transect of 7 current meters and pressure sensors provide wave and current measurements. The bathymetry was surveyed repeatedly. Ten GPS-tracked drifters were released for several hours on each of 5 days with different waves, currents and wind. Drifter trajectories and numerical simulations suggest that complex circulation features, including long-lived surfzone eddies and transient rip currents, contribute to mixing on spatial scales of 10-100m. Drifter dispersion statistics within and seawards of the surfzone, and on different days, will be compared and contrasted. The dependence of eddy diffusivities on waves and currents, and the mechanisms of dispersion (e.g. individual bores, shear waves) will be discussed."
