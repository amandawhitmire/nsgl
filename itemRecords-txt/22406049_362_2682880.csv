12,Abstract:,"Predator responses to gradients in prey density have important implications forpopulation regulation and are a potential structuring force for subtidal marine communities,par​ticularly on rocky reefs where herbivorous sea urchins can drive community state shifts. Onrocky reefs in southern California where predatory sea otters have been extirpated, top-downcontrol of sea urchins by alternative predators has been hypothesized but rarely tested experimentally.​In laboratory feeding assays, predatory spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) demonstrateda saturating functional response to urchin prey, whereby urchin proportional mortalitywas inversely density-​dependent. In field experiments on rocky reefs near San Diego, California,pred​ators (primarily the labrid fish California sheephead, Semicossyphus pulcher) inflictedhighly variable mortality on purple urchin (Strongylocentr​otus purpuratus) prey across all densitylevels. However, at low to moderate densities commonly observed within kelp forests, purpleurchin mortality increased to a peak at a density of ~11 urchins/m2. Above that level, atdensities typical of urchin barrens, purple urchin mortality was density-​independent.Whe​n largerred urchins (Mesocentrotus franciscanus) were offered to predators simultaneously withpurple urchins, mortality was density-​independent. Underwater videography revealed a positiverelatio​nship between purple urchin density and both the number and richness of fishpredators, but these correlations were not observed when red urchins were present. Our resultsdemonstr​ate highly variable mortality rates across prey densities in this system and suggest thattop-down control of urchins can occur only under limited circumstances. Our findings provideinsight into the dynamics of alternate community states observed on rocky reefs."
