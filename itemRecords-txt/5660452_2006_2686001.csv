12,Abstract:,"Formulation of management policy in response to the dramatic increase in landings of the red sea urchin in northern California has been complicated by several problems. Recruitment involves two possible depensatory density-​dependent mechanisms: (1) a juvenile refuge from predation under adult spines, and (2) a minimum density necessary for successful broadcast spawning. Growth and mortality rates are poorly known and vary with location. Size distributions vary in form, having a single mode at large sizes with an occasional additional mode at small sizes. Current management policy consists of a lower size limit and temporal closures. The recent decline in landings has led to interest in additional ways of controlling effort. Here, recent analyses of size distributions to obtain estimates of growth and mortality rates for this population are reviewed. Using these preliminary parameter estimates, the potential for indirectly controlling fishing effort on sessile species using rotating spatial harvests is analyzed."
