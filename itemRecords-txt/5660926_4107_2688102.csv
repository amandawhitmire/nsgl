10,Abstract:,"The 'standard-​of-​practice' or 'Fitness for Purpose (FFP)' method of evaluating the acceptability of an offshore oil platform is examined critically in this paper. The method proceeds by graphing a platform's total probability of failure against some measure of the consequences of its failure. The format of the FFP approach, when evaluated in the context of its relationship to the different types of consequences of platform failure, minimizes the approach's usefulness to regulators: consequences are evlauted in dollars and lumped together, but regulators are concerned with lives and with spillage. Distributions for the FFP curves are derived in this paper and a maximum expected value is determined for the total fleet economic risk to owners operating under the FFP standard. An example is given for the development of a pair of new standards for life and ecosystem safety. A constant probability model, used to handle the life safety side of the example, induces a risk function that increased with consequences. The implications of both standards are assessed in terms of their expected maximum values of risk to the total fleet of platforms."
