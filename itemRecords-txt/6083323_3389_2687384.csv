8,Abstract:,"Every year millions of Americans consume raw molluscan shellfish, especially oysters and clams. For some people, however, eating raw or undercooked molluscan shellfish can cause serious illness or death from Vibrio vulnificus. Vibrio vulnificus is a gram-negative bacterium and is considered the most lethal of the vibrios inhabiting brackish and salt water. This bacterium is not the result of bacteriological or chemical pollution of marine waters, but occurs naturally in warm, coastal areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico. V. vulnificus is found in higher concentrations from April through October when coastal waters are warm."
