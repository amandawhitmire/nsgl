9,Abstract:,"Calluses on plants, including seaweeds, are masses of unorganized tissues formed as a result of injury; similar abnormal growth-forms of seaweeds which produce mounds of undifferentiate​d tissues are referred to here as callus-like growth. This study was designed to investigate conditions for callus induction and culture. The conditions which allowed calluses and callus-like growths to develop in several green, brown, and red seaweeds are described."
