10,Abstract:,"Recoveries of high-seas disk tags in North American freshwater areas and recoveries of coded-wire tags (CWT) at sea provide evidence of the ocean distribution of North American steelhead trout. In this pilot study, my goal was to delineate North American steelhead ocean distribution by seasonal race, geographical region, and distinct population segment (DPS) using ocean and freshwater recapture locations. A second goal was to investigate whether observed patterns of steelhead ocean distribution could be related to sea surface temperature and to speculate how ocean warming could affect steelhead ocean distribution. Data showed that recovery efforts are limited in the western Gulf of Alaska and most ocean recoveries are restricted to the summer season. However, results suggest young fish and those originating from Oregon and California are distributed in the Gulf of Alaska, while older fish and those originating from stocks further north are distributed widely across the North Pacific. In summer, North American steelhead are not randomly distributed in the ocean with respect to sea surface temperature. They seem to have a preferred temperature range of 8-14 deg C. The ocean surface area (km2) of steelhead preferred temperatures increased from 1960s to 1980s and been declining since that time. I speculate that under future global warming conditions, steelhead ocean distribution may move northwards to cooler temperatures, resulting in a decrease in abundance along the southern edge of their freshwater distribution."
