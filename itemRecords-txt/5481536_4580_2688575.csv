9,Abstract:,"Interest in examining the enzymatic degradation of chitin in the biosphere led to the present study of the enzyme, chitobiase. From the nucleotide sequence determined in this study of the gene encoding this enzyme, an amino acid sequence was deduced. Protein labeling experiments in minicells indicate that processing of prechitobiase is sensitive to globomycin, which strongly suggests that chitobiase is a lipoprotein processed in a manner similar to the major outer membrane lipoprotein of ""E. coli"". When the expression of this enzyme in ""V. harveyi"" and the cloning host, ""E. coli"", was examined, three promoters were identified, two of which were used by both ""E. coli"" and ""V. harveyi"", and a third used only by ""E. coli""."
