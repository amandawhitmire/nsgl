10,Abstract:,"Northern marinas must be designed for the effects of ice and winter conditions. Marina sites, although themselves specific, experience forces and actions that can be predicted and generalized for design. Criteria and strategies for design of marinas and structures in northern climates are presented. Included are estimates of horizontal and vertical forces, structural and flotation dock arrangements, deicing systems, and moveable/removeâ€‹able constructions. Comparisons of strategies available to designers can be rationally made, and safe, economical docks can be constructed."
