9,Abstract:,"Sequential development of PKX, the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease, is elucidated in rainbow trout ""Salmo gairdneri"" by light and electron microscopy. Epizootiologicaâ€‹l and sequential development data support the hypothesis that the interstitial form of PKX and the intraluminal myxosporeans belong to the same organism."
