13,Abstract:,"Quality factors important in sea urchin roe marketing are color and texture. In two laboratory experiments, spring and fall (when sea urchins are in different stages of gonadal growth and reproductive state), ""Strongylocentr​otus franciscanus"" were starved or fed a low carotenoid pigment diet, a high carotenoid pigment diet, or kelp. Gonads from laboratory groups and three grades of commercially processed roe (Fort Bragg A, B, and C) were examined for color and texture."
