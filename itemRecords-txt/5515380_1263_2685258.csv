10,Abstract:,"This volume contains thirty-six of the forty papers presented at this symposium which brought together diving scientists on a national basis and provided an opportunity for sharing information on the many advances in technology, underwater methods and techniques, science and diver safety. The focus was on novel advances in underwater science in the areas of oceanography and methods and techniques of underwater research. Presentations included (but were not limited to) a variety of physical and biological sampling techniques, reports of diver observations of various underwater communities, dive table usage and aspects of diving physiology, underwater communications, emergency medical care for divers in the tropics, breathing mixtures, and instrument installation techniques. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. Observations of the interactions of gelatinous zooplankton in a nearshore environment. Peter J. Auster, et al. pp. 1-8. 2. Biological monitoring of hard bottom reef communities off Dade County Florida: community description. Stephen M. Blair and Brian S. Flynn pp. 9-24. 3. Offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, conversion to artificial reefs: an opportunity for long term biological studies. David Bull pp. 25-28. 4. Red urchin survey of Northern California.
