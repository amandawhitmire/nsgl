11,Abstract:,"We examined the hypothesis that timing and availability of krill regulates prey consumption by Cassin's auklets Ptychoramphus aleuticus. We tested this hypothesis by conducting research cruises to determine the abundance and distribution of krill in 2004 (May-October) and 2005 (February-â€‹October). This hypothesis is important because prior studies have suggested that 1) wintertime oceanographic conditions influence the availability of E. pacifica in the water column, and 2) there are temporal differences in the availability of E. pacifica and T. spinifera. We found that E. pacifica and T. spinifera were the two most abundant species and accounted for 80% and 12% of the krill in the samples, respectively. E. pacifica in the upper water column was present year-round, with juveniles present in all samples except in winter. T. spinifera were absent from the upper water column in winter and mid-spring. With the exception of these dates, juveniles were present in all samples. Adult stages of E. pacifica occurring in the upper water column during the day were associated with cold waters during strong upwelling events. Male and female E. pacifica were found near the surface during April and June 2005. Preliminary evidence suggests that E. pacifica spawns early in the year relative to T. spinifera. Highest abundance of mature females was found in spring for E. pacifica and early-summer for T. spinifera. Timing and availability of krill resembles average ""prey switching"" pattern observed in prey consumed by Cassin's auklets on the Farallones Island."
