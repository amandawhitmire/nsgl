12,Abstract:,"A cDNA library was constructed from eyestalk neural tissue of the American lobster, ""Homarus americanus,"" With the use of PCR, a 180 bp probe was idolated and purified. This probe was labeled and used to examine levels of CHH expression in eyestalk neural tissue at different periods of the lobster molt cycle. CHH mRNA is undetectable in postmolt, low in intermolt, and high in premolt. CHH expression in whole late embryos and 4 larval stages was quantified. Expression levels did not rise in eyestalk neural tissue following emersion after 1 or 2 h."
