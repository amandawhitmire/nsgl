9,Abstract:,"Organisms are not isolated in their environment. Organisms must interact with other individuals of their own species, with other species, and with their physical environment. The study of the interactions between organisms and their environment is called ecology (Greek: oikos- house; logia- study). The study of ecology can encompass all aspects of biology; from physiology to behavior, because any change within an organism has the potential to affect its relationship with the environment. Likewise, ecological interactions can be studied at many different levels; between an organism and its environment, between an organism and a group of organisms, or between two groups. In this unit we will cover many of the important concepts within ecology."
