11,Abstract:,"This workshop was organized to review the state of knowledge about the effects of dredging-​induced turbidity on the physiology, behavior, and survival of anadromous fishes in the Pacific Northwest (dredging effects attributable to chemical toxicity were not considered). The basic question was can anadromous fishes detect and behaviorally avoid suspended sediment concentrations that may be harmful to them? Although the focus is on salmonids migrating through estuaries, some papers include information on striped bass, smelt and other anadromous fishes, as well as on riverine effects. The result is an assessment of the issues currently surrounding dredging impacts, a re-evaluation of strategies for minimal-impact dredging, and recommended approaches for evaluating and quantifying the more significant impacts. Workshop discussions centered on the biological basis for temporal and spatial limits for dredging activities that are presumed to impact anadromous fish poulations in Pacific Northwest estuaries. The following papers are included in this publication: 1. Physical and chemical alterations associated with dredging. Mark W. LaSalle pp. 1-12. 2. Migratory behavior of Pacific salmon in estuaries: recent results with ultrasonic telemetry. Thomas P. Quinn pp. 13-25. 3. Effects of chronic turbidity on anadromous salmonids: recent studies and assessment techniques perspective. John W. Sigler pp. 26-37. 4. Potential effects of dredging activity on early life stages of striped bass (Morone saxatilis"") in the San Francisco Bay area. Charles H. Hanson and Craig P. Walton pp. 38-56. 5. Sublethal effects of dredged sediments on juvenile salmon. James A. Servizi pp. 57-63. 6. Effects of turbidity on benthic foraging and predation risk in juvenile chinook salmon. Robert S. Gregory pp. 64-73. 7. Effects of the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption on Columbia River estuarine fishes: implications for dredging in northwest estuaries. Robert L. Emmett, et al. pp. 74-91. 8. Turbidity and suspended sediments at the Alcatraz, California, dumpsite. Douglas A. Segar pp. 92-101. 9. Entrainment of anadromous fish by Hopper Dredge at the mouth of the Columbia River. Kim W. Larson and Christine E. Mohl pp. 102-112. 10. Fish entrainment by dredges in Grays Harbor, Washington. Katherine A. McGraw and David A. Armstrong. 11. Use of dredged material to enhance fish habitat in Lower Granite Reservoir, Idaho-​Washington. David H. Bennett, et al. pp. 132-143."
