11,,"Low levels of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the aquatic environment may interfere with the efflux transporters of aquatic organisms. These transporters act to efflux putative toxicants out of the cell and organism. This article reviews the properties of these transporters as regards substrate specificity and substrate affinity, protective role, and the modulation of activity by pharmaceutical products. The authors suggest directions for future research."
