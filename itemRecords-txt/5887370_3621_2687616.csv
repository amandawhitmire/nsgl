12,Abstract:,The time-dependent cross-shore sediment transport model CBREAK is compared with the irregular wave experiment on dune profile evolution due to overwash. CBREAK with the bottom friction factor calibrated to reproduce the measured wave overtopping rate is used to predict the irregular wave breaking and overtopping of a dune as well as the sediment suspension and net onshore sediment transport on the overwashed dune. The computed results are qualitatively realistic but the model in its present form cannot predict fairly uniform erosion on the seaward face of the dune.
