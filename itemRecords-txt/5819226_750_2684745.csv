12,Abstract:,"Humans intensely use southern California rocky shores for recreational activities. People also collect intertidal organisms for consumption, fish bait, home aquariums, and other purposes. Many of these shores have been designated as California Marine Life Refuges (CMLRs) or State Ecological Reserves (SERs), where the removal of most intertidal organisms, except for scientific purposes, has been unlawful for 30 years. In a year-long study of eight Orange County shores, unlawful collecting of organisms was often observed. The CMLR or SER designation did not deter collecting. Without effective enforcement, adequate signage, and educational programs to increase public awareness, CMLRs and SERs are not protecting rocky intertidal populations on heavily visited southern California shores."
