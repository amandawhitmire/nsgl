12,Abstract:,"To reduce the incidence of recreational waterborne illness, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are measured to assess water quality and inform beach management. Recently, predictive FIB models have been used to aid managers in making beach posting and closure decisions. However, those predictive models must be trained using rich historical data sets consisting of FIB and environmental data that span years, and many beaches lack such data sets. Here, we investigate whether water quality data collected during discrete short duration, high-frequency beach sampling events (e.g., samples collected at sub-hourly intervals for 24−48 h) are sufficient to train predictive models that can be used for beach management. We use data collected during six high-​frequency sampling events at three California marine beaches and train a total of 126 models using common data-driven techniques. Tide, solar irradiation, water temperature, significant wave height, and offshore wind speed were found to be the most important environmental variables in the models. We validate the predictive performance of models using withheld data. Random forests are consistently the top performing model type. Overall, we find that data-​driven models trained using high-frequency FIB and environmental data perform well at predicting water quality and can be used to inform public health decisions at beaches."
