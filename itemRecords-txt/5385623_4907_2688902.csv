9,Abstract:,"The potential risk of ""Clostridium botulinum"" growth in fresh fish stored under modified atmospheres remains unclear. Few studies have identified qualitatively certain conditions leading to toxigenesis. The purpose of this work was to develop a prediction model for ""C. botulinum"" growth and toxigenesis in red snapper inoculated with spores of 13 nonproteolytic strains and stored under 3 MA at 4 deg C to 30 deg C for up to 21 days. At the 10 (to the zero power) spore/sample level the earliest time to detect toxin production at 4, 8, 12, 17, and 30 deg C under all modified atmospheres was 21, 12, 9, 6 and 2 days, respectively. At the 10 (to the first power) spores/sample level the earliest times for the same temperatures were 21, 9, 6, 3-6 and 1-2 days, respectively. The probability of toxigenesis was affected significantly by temperature, storage time, atmosphere x temperature, and temperature x time but not by atmosphere. Studies involving other fish substrates are in progress."
