12,Abstract:,"Withering syndrome (WS) has been associated with catastrophic declines in black abalone population in California. In an effort to identify the etiological agent of WS and to characterize the progression of this disease, the authors initiated a transmission study in which abalone from Ano Nuevo Island, a location free of WS, shared aquaria with animals from Vandenberg Air Force Base, a location where WS is epizootic. The mean incubation period of WS was 245 days with a mean time to death after development of clinical signs of 42 days. Cumulative mortality was significantly different between the negative control (unexposed) Ano Nuevo Island abalone (25 percent mortality) and both the exposed Ano Nuevo Island abalone (85 percent) and the positive control Vandenberg abalone (100 percent). In addition, significant differences in prevalences of a recently described Rickettsiales-​like prokaryote (RLP), '""Candidatus"" Xenohaliotis californiensis,​' were observed between negative control animals (no RLPs) and those with WS (both the experimentally exposed and the Vandenberg abalone were infected with RLPs). All abalone infected with the RLP had signs of WS, including decreased condition indices, foot muscle atrophy, and digestive gland degeneration. No correlation between intensity of RLP infection and degree of WS was observed, suggesting a complex relationship between the RLP and clinical disease in black abalone."
