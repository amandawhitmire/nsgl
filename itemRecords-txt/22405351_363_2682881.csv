9,Abstract:,"In 2004, the Russian River Coho Salmon Captive Broodstock Program (Broodstock Program) began releasing juvenile coho salmon into tributaries of the Russian River with the goal of reestablishing ​ populations that were on the brink of extirpation from the watershed. California Sea Grant at University of California (UC) worked with local, state, and federal biologists to design and implement a coho salmon monitoring program to track the survival and abundance of hatchery-​released fish. Since the first Broodstock Program releases, UC has been closely monitoring smolt abundance, adult returns, survival, and spatial distribution of coho populations in four Broodstock Program release streams: Willow, Dutch Bill, Green Valley, and Mill creeks. Data collected from this effort are provided to the Broodstock Program for use in adaptively managing future releases.The intention of our monitoring and research is to provide science-based information to all stakeholders involved in salmon and steelhead recovery. Our work would not be possible without the support of our partners, including several public resource agencies and non-profit organizations, along with hundreds of private landowners who have granted us access to the streams that flow through their properties. In this seasonal monitoring update, we provide results from our spring downstream migrant trapping effort, as well as operation of PIT tag detection systems, located on Willow, Dutch Bill, Green Valley, and Mill creeks. Additional information and previous reports can be found on our website at http://ca-​sgep.ucsd.edu/r​ussianrivercoho​."
