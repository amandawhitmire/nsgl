11,Abstract:,"This is the spanish language version of 'Natural Marine Toxin', a pamphlet abstracted in ""SGA"" 8(1). It describes PSP toxins and domoic acid, powerful nerve poisons that have no taste or odor, or any visible appearance in seafoods. Cleaning and cooking the seafood in many cases will neither remove nor destroy the toxins. California's toxin monitoring programs and harvesting quarantines are described."
