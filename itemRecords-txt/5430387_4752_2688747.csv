9,Abstract:,"Interest in protoplast production from phaeophytes such as ""Sargassum"" stems from economical considerations of propagation of ""Sargassum"" for biomass methane production, as well as interest in physiological phenomena, such as regeneration of their complex cell walls. This study provides a reliable method for the production of protoplasts from ""S. muticum"" as well as from other species of ""Sargassum""."
