13,Abstract:,"Scientists used acoustic telemetry techniques to determine home range size and site fidelity, activity patterns, and habitat preference of adult kelp bass within a marine life refuge at Santa Catalina Island, California. Home range sizes and habitat preferences of fish tracked were used to assess whether the reserve was of adequate size and habitat composition to protect the adult reproductive stock."
