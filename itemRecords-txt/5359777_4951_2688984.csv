12,,"By 1983 U.S. fishery exports had declined to just over $1 billion, while imports had risen to over $5 billion. Production levels at many processing plants are falling to non-profitable levels, accelerating these trends. The large Pacific whiting (hake), ""Merluccius productus,"" is plentiful off the U.S. west coast and, if developed as a fishery and a product, could offset otherwise lost trade. Objectives of work described here are to report on whiting market information, develop whiting products, investigate markets, and aid producers by developing information on handling, storage, processing and marketing."
