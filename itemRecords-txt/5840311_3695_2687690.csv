13,Abstract:,"Invasive species can threaten native biota genetically as well as ecologically. In plants, hybridization with invaders can readily threaten native species with extinction. This study was motivated by the desire to understand the dynamics of hybridization between ""Spartina alterniflora"" and ""S. foliosa"" and natural selection of hybrids in this mixture of alien and native cordgrass in San Francisco Bay. The authors describe the diversity of cpDNA in the hybrids and assess evidence for the direction of gene flow among populations of the two parental species and hybrids."
