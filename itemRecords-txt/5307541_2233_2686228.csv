9,Abstract:,"This report describes in some detail the physical processes that occur at the shore due to wave action and applies these concepts to a number of specific sites within the State. Coastal planners, local governmental agencies and others who have responsibilitieâ€‹s and interests in the shoreline may find similarities between these examples and their own problem areas. Through an exchange of knowledge on coastal processes, past mistakes are less likely to be repeated and methods of preserving and enhancing California's varied shoreline can be developed. This report summarizes some of the more fundamental information necessary to understand nearshore processes, outlines some principles of coastal zone planning that are compatible with these natural processes, and suggests recommendations for correcting specific coastal problems along the California coast."
