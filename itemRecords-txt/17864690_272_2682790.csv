12,Abstract:,"Understanding intraspecific variability of life history characteristics​ is necessary to determine local fisheries management strategies. Gopher rockfish, Sebastes carnatus, comprise 50% of the estimated shallow nearshore recreational rockfish catch in California, yet insufficient local data exist regarding life history traits of this species. We defined growth parameters and size and age at reproductive maturity for gopher rockfish in south-​central California. The growth parameter values of fish from this study are similar to previously published research from California; however, results from this study also indicate that these fish reach reproductive maturity at a larger size and an older age when compared to gopher rockfish sampled throughout central California between 1977–82. Furthermore, results from this study show that the size and longevity of gopher rockfish has increased after the establishment of two south-central California marine protected areas."
