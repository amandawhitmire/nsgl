13,Abstract:,"As Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning (CMSP) processes take hold worldwide, it is important to design stakeholder engagement processes that result in a stable outcome. An outcome is considered stable when all stakeholders agree they “can live with” the outcome. This paper uses the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Initiative’s (Initiative) stakeholder process to design a network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the South Coast region of California as a case study for consideration by other CMSP policy makers. We evaluate shortcomings in the stakeholder process and make recommendations to improve future multi-​stakeholder marine policy processes, particularly those occurring in highly complex, urban ocean environments. In our view, the South Coast process was a good process with a good outcome - but it was not a great process with a great outcome. In our analysis, we would find the outcome to be “great” if three conditions had been met: if unanimous or nearly-​unanimous agreement had been reached on one MPA network proposal; if this proposal had been fully consistent with the objective criteria set forth in the Science Advisory Team (SAT) guidelines; and if the process had been broadly regarded as fair by participants and regional stakeholders. The level of stakeholder satisfaction with a process is a key measure of its effectiveness and the outcome’s ongoing support and stability.Our analysis is based on a robust set of four diverse and complementary sources, including a 40-question retrospective survey conducted jointly by the USC Sea Grant Program and CONCUR."
