8,Abstract:,"Fisheries are an important source of income for many coastal communities. Starting in 1999, the National Marine Fisheries Service declared several West Coast rockfish species to be overfished under standards of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA). In response, the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) implemented stringent regulations to prevent further overfishing and rebuild rockfish stocks, with severe economic consequences for many communities. In 2001, the entire West Coast groundfish fishery was declared a Federal Disaster. Managing this fishery is a complex task. The fishery's management plan regulates commercial and recreational fleets, includes several types of gear, and covers more than ninety species in three states. Bottom trawling is among the most important sectors of the fishery, and is managed closely through a limited entry program. Historically, the PFMC used bimonthly limits on landings to regulate trawlers. The economic objective of these limits was to produce a uniform flow of groundfish over the year to meet total allowable catch for each stock. However, bycatch is a problem for trawlers, and as limits on rockfish landings decreased, regulatory discard by these vessels became critical. To avoid closing the fishery, the PFMC implemented a Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA) that closed large parts of the continental shelf to bottom trawling and other types of fishing. The RCA was established to eliminate, or drastically reduce, levels of fishing effort in areas with the highest levels of rockfish bycatch. The RCA is expected to remain intact during the rebuilding period for rockfish stocks, which could last several decades. During this period, boundaries of the RCA may be adjusted, depending on stock status and other factors. In some areas, permanent closures to all types of fishing, known as marine reserves, are being proposed. An important question for fishery managers in these cases is how the spatial distribution of fishing effort would respond to the proposed changes. To address this question, this paper develops a microeconomic model of groundfish trawlers that is both dynamic and spatial, which is based on a rational expectations competitive equilibrium. Advantages of a rational expectations model for the work in this paper include an explicit representation of information sets held by individuals at each point in time. In addition, this model has an operational, and thus testable, mechanism for translating information sets held by individuals into predictions about the future that can affect aggregate outcomes. While perhaps not strictly necessary in every economic study, these features of the model are important for understanding economic behavior in settings, such as fisheries, that are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty."
