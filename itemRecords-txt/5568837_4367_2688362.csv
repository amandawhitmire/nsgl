13,Abstract:,"The occurrence of Pacific oyster nocardiosis (PON) was found to correspond with peak periods of summer mortality as described for Pacific oysters, ""Crassostrea gigas"", reared in certain bays in Washington State and British Columbia. Diseased oysters contained an infiltration of hemocytes surrounding tufts of gram-positive bacteria of the genus ""Nocardia"". Injection of the bacterium isolated from diseased oysters into healthy oysters resulted in infections with the same characteristic histopathologicâ€‹al changes as observed in individuals with PON. The seasonal coincidence and involvement of older oysters containing bacterial foci suggests that PON is a causal factor in summer mortality in certain areas."
