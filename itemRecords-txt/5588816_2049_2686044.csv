13,Abstract:,"Using data that were collected regularly during four years, the objectives of this study were (1) to assess seasonal and spatial changes in species composition, abundance, and habitat associations of fish assemblages in Elkhorn Slough; and (2) to evaluate the interaction between fish assemblages in the slough and those in adjacent nearshore ocean habitat, especially in terms of 'slough dependence or opportunism.' This study provides baseline information prerequisite to long-term monitoring of fish assemblages in Elkhorn Slough (which has been designated a National Estuarine Research Reserve), their response to potential environmental changes (both naturally and human-induced), and their contribution to the nearshore fishery resources of Monterey Bay."
