9,Abstract:,"The sea urchins ""Strongylocentr​otus purpuratus"" and ""S. franciscanus"" are common in intertidal and shallow rocky habitats along the west coast of North America. One hypothesis for the population dynamics of these sea urchins is that intense predation by sea otters on the urchins as they outgrow or move out of protected crevices balances substantial annual recruitment. Alternatively, low levels of recruitment, punctuated by episodic high levels once every few years or less often, may introduce animals to the system. Episodic mortality from disease or storms also could strongly influence the populations. Here, long-term data on the density, size structure and microhabitat distribution of the sea urchins are used to distinguish between these modes of population dynamics; the impacts of the major potential sources of mortality for the populations (sea otters, sea stars, disease) are evaluated."
