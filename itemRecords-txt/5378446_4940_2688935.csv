11,Abstract:,"We report here mainly optical microscope data on the frozen structures of fish tissues, which have been frozen either slowly or rapidly and then placed in frozen storage at one of three temperatures. In addition we report data on the changing biochemical status of these fish, obtained by measuring such parameters as myofibrillar protein solubility, protein ATPase activity, water holding capacity, tissue homogenate pH, and viscosity."
