11,Abstract:,"New Zealand's quota management system (QMS), with its emphasis on individual transferable quotas (ITQs), removal of subsidies, and promotion of international export, is a long-standing program viewed as an example of the market- based approach to fisheries management. This book chapter examines the changes in fishers' perceptions of the QMS. For example, has ITQ management led to a perceived increase or decrease in violations of fisheries law? Has the structure of the fishing industry changed? Is ITQ management perceived as improving or hurting the fishing industry? Do these perceptions vary depending on the amount of quota a participant owns?"
