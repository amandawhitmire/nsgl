14,Abstract:,"During smoltification, coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") develop seawater adaptability. Hypophysectomy allows the analysis of endocrine control of ion regulation. In this study, the effects of hypophysectomy on survival, NA+, K+-ATPase activity, plasma osmolality, plasma sodium concentration and plasma levels of several hormones in seawater (SW) and in freshwater (FW) were examined in coho salmon at various times up to 7 days after transfer. Special attention was paid to the time course of response of hypophysectomiz​ed fish to FW because previous data showed that these animals survive in a hypotonic environment with little effect on plasma sodium levels and plasma osmolality."
