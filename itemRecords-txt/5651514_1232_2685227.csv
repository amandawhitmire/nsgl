11,Abstract:,"Marine fish enhancement efforts and research in the Pacific Northwest have been limited. Serious efforts to enhance marine fish stocks with hatchery technologies are under way in several regions of the U.S.; however, the greatest concentrations of experience and expertise with marine culture are found overseas, in Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and Mediterranean countries. This proceedings covers a three-day international conference of researchers, aquaculturists and resource managers with experience in the culture and enhancement of marine species similar to those found in the Pacific Northwest. This publication includes technical abstracts as well as summaries of work group discussions concerning potential challenges and problems regarding marine culture and enhancement and possible directions for research and management."
