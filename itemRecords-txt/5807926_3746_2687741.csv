27,Abstract:,"The authors of this paper discuss the need for improved management approaches, such as no-take marine reserves, in reducing the rate at which humans deplete exploited marine populations and degrade marine ecosystems. Networks of no- take marine reserves have the potential to protect coastal ecosystem structure and functioning, benefit exploited populations and fisheries, improve scientific understanding of marine ecosystems, and provide enriched opportunities for non-extractive human activities."
