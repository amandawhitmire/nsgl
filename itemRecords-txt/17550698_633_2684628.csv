18,Abstract:,"Within California, there are several programs for studying and monitoring harmful algal blooms (HABs); however, these programs have been largely uncoordinated with respect to each other. To address this issue, the California Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring and Alert Program (CalHABMAP) was established in 2008, the outcome of a community-led meeting and organizational effort. CalHABMAP created an integrated, statewide, harmful algal bloom monitoring and alert network by coordinating organizations and researchers currently collecting HAB data and developing a centralized portal for the dissemination of this information. The main goal of HABMAP is to implement a statewide HAB network and forecasting system for California, and potentially the US West Coast. CalHABMAP has succeeded in highlighting the need for a coordinated network and serves as partner for regional and national efforts led by the NOAA National Ocean Service, the Integrated Ocean Observing System, and the NASA Applied Sciences Program."
