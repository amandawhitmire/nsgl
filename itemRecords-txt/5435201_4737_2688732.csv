9,Abstract:,"The ambiguity regarding the origin and number of lobster egg coats is due to the fact that most previous studies have been done using light microscopy, which lacks sufficient resolution to analyze these coats accurately. By examining lobster oocytes at the ultrastructural level under various experimental conditions, the number and origin of coats surrounding the unfertilized and fertilized lobster oocyte have been clarified and are reported here."
