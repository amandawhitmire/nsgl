12,Abstract:,"This study was undertaken to resolve the relationship between developmental stage and the response of the endocrine system of coho salmon to short-term exposure to seawater. Coho salmon at different developmental stages were subjected to a 24 h seawater challenge, after which circulating levels of thyroxine, growth hormone, cortisol and several physiological indicators of development were measured. The authors report that developmental stage influences the magnitude of the response of these components of the endocrine system to increased salinity."
