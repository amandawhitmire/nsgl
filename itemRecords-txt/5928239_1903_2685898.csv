12,Abstract:,"MSY (maximum sustainable yield) as a management tool simply won't go away, regardless of evidence that 'managing for MSY' has not been effective. This paper reports an investigation of Ricker's definition of MSY, focusing on the words 'average catch,"" ""continuously taken,"" and ""existing environmental conditions,"" The investigation involved development of a model for the squid fishery in California. Constructing the model in a step-wise fashion permitted illustration of particular points. Additionally, results from the Third Mote Symposium that also shed light on this issue are summarized."
