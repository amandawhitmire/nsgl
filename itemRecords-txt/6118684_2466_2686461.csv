12,Abstract:,"Two new species of Zoramia (formerly a subgenus of Apogon) are described. Zoramia flebila, described from Fiji, has blue spots on the sides, blue teardrop-shaped marks under the eyes, and two narrow yellow lines on the midside. It also has a small spot surrounded by diffuse melanophores on the caudal peduncle, and lacks an opercular spot and dark vertical lines above the anal-fin rays. It has scattered melanophores on the breast, pelvic fins, and the entire second dorsal fin, and a line of dark pigment along the anal-fin base. There are 27-30 gill rakers, usually 28 or 29. Zoramia fragilis, previously thought to range from the Indian Ocean into the Pacific, was shown to consist of two species; Z. fragilis restricted to Mozambique, Madagascar, and the Seychelles, and those in the Pacific Ocean a separate species here described as Z. viridiventer. These two species are separated by the number of gill rakers and dorsal and anal-fin spine length. Fraser (1972) divided the apogonid fish genus Apogon Lacep�de into ten subgenera, mainly on osteological characters. The subgenera Pristiapogon and Zoramia Jordan were revised by Fraser and Lachner (1985), who recognized four species within Zoramia Jordan: A. leptacanthus Bleeker, the type species, wide-ranging from the east coast of Africa to the Samoa Islands; A. fragilis Smith with a disjunct population, one from Mozambique (type locality), Madagascar, and the Seychelles, and the other from Indonesia and the Philippines to the Marshall Islands and Samoa Islands; A. gilberti (Jordan and Seale) from the Philippines, Sabah, and Indonesia, east to Palau and Yap; and A. perlitus, described as a new species from Palau, Papua New Guinea, Molucca Islands, and the Philippines. Rodman-Bergman (2004) reviewed the generic and subgeneric classification of the Apogonidae. Using external morphology, skeletal characters and a detailed study of the cephalic lateralis system, she concluded that Apogon is an unnatural taxon: ""Every cladogram generated in these analyses showed that the subgenera of these two taxa (Apogon and Pterapogon) were more closely related to other genera, than they were to one another."" Based on her findings we are treating the subgenus Zoramia of Fraser (1972) as a genus. While conducting a survey of the fishes of Fiji, we collected individuals of a species of Zoramia that we did not recognize. The specimens were similar in color to Z. gilberti, but lacked the spot on the opercular flap and have distinctive blue teardrop-like marks on the cheek and blue spots on the side of the body above the pectoral fin. In checking comparative material of other species of Zoramia, we discovered that the eastern population identified as Zoramia fragilis is a distinct species. The purpose of this paper is to describe these two new species of cardinalfishes. We present first the diagnosis of Zoramia based primarily on Fraser and Lachner (1985), followed by a revised key to the species of the genus and the descriptions of the two new species."
