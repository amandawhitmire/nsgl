10,Abstract:,"This study provides the first detailed description of the events at hatching for an anamniotic vertebrate egg. California Grunion are ideally suited for this study, because these fish eggs incubate fully terrestrially and delay hatching until presented with an environmental trigger. The authors suggest that the process of hatching in Grunion involves an enzymatic weakening of the chorion followed by the embryo's active efforts to escape. Using a dissecting microscope, microscope camera, and digital video camera, they observed embryonic movements within the chorion prior to and during hatch. After exposure to a hatching trigger (i.e., mechanical agitation in seawater), embryos significantly increase the amount and types of movements within the egg. The chorion distorts in a location superior to the caudal region, and fluid escapes from the egg. Embryonic activity usually culminates in a vigorous tail lash that splits the chorion open. Generally within two minutes the Grunion larva emerges."
