12,Abstract:,"Population declines in wild and cultured abalones (Haliotis spp.) due to a bacterial disease called witheringsyndro​me (WS) have been documented along the northeastern Pacific Ocean. However, observed differences inspecies susceptibility to the disease are not well understood. Here, we examined the susceptibility of threetemperate abalone species, the cool water (4–14 °C) pinto or northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), theintermediate water (8–18 °C) red abalone (H. rufescens), and the warm water (12–23 °C) pink abalone (H. corrugata),to experimental WS infection at temperatures facilitating disease proliferation. Mortality data pairedwith histological and molecular detection of the WS pathogen confirmed that these abalone species exhibitdifferen​t levels of susceptibility to infection and resistance to WS development ranging from high susceptibilitya​nd low resistance in pinto abalone to moderate/low susceptibility and resistance in red and pink abalones. Thetemperature associated with WS induced mortalities also varied among species: pinto abalone died at the lowestexperimen​tal temperature (17.32 ± 0.09 °C), while red abalone died at an intermediate temperature(17.​96 ± 0.16 °C), and pink abalone required the highest temperature (18.84 ± 0.16 °C). When data from thecurrent and previous studies were examined, susceptibility to WS was inversely related to phylogenetic distancefrom white abalone (H. sorenseni), which had the highest susceptibility and lowest resistance of all abalonespecies tested prior to the current study. These results provide further evidence that an abalone’s thermal optimaand phylogenetic relationship can determine its susceptibility to WS; species with cool water evolutionaryhis​tories are most susceptible to WS and the most susceptible species appear to be closely related. Differencesamon​g the thermal ranges of abalone species have broad implications for WS disease dynamics and highlight theimportance of understanding the mechanisms governing the abalone-WS relationship in order to properlymanage declining abalone populations."
