8,Abstract:,"A modern multidisciplina​ry approach to marine fisheries resource management is presented. The fisheries resource management team comprises at least a program manager, fisheries biologist, fishing industry specialist, economist, sociologists, and in some cases a public-health specialist. The management program consists of the following seven major phases: initial contact and information gathering; information compilation; information synthesis, including data entry into a species information sheet; preliminary research; modeling; development of management scenarios; and the selection of a final management plant. Emphasis is placed on ranking procedures and the use of a powerful decision-making method. A brief summary of information on fisheries of the Indian Ocean is presented."
