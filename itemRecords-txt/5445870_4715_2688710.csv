10,Abstract:,"It has long been known that the loss of membrane integrity is a critical damaging event incurred by cells during freeze/thaw. In this study, compounds that are known to maintain bilayer integrity and protein function during freeze/thaw (i.e., trehalose, sucrose, proline, glycerol, and DMSO) were used in an effort to cryopreserve shrimp sperm. Using the in-vitro acrosome reaction as a viability assay, the authors were able to assess the effect of different cooling rates and cryoprotectants on sperm survival after storage in liquid nitrogen (-196 deg C)."
