10,Abstract:,"At first glance, azamerone may look like another chlorinated dihydroquinone, but closer inspection reveals that this molecule contains an unprecedented phthalazinone core. This unique compound was recently isolated from the marine sedimentderived Streptomyces sp. CNQ-766, and some interesting questions relating to its biosynthesis were raised. Unlike pyridazomycin, which is one of the few natural products containing a pyridazine ring, the nitrogen atoms in azamerone are not derived from the cyclization of two amino acids. The rationale behind this hypothesis is supported with the isolation of several compounds containing a diazo functional group such as the SF2415 and A80915 series of chlorinated dihydroquinones​, which are also produced by this bacterium. Given the structural novelty of azamerone and its relation to the chlorinated dihydroquinones​, we set forth to explore the formation of the phthalazinone core through a variety of feeding experiments with 13C and 15N-labeled molecules. These experiments confirmed that the azamerone phthalazinone core is derived from a napthoquinone precursor such as in the chlorinated dihydroquinones and progresses through a diazo intermediate. Results from the various feeding experiments will be discussed in detail."
