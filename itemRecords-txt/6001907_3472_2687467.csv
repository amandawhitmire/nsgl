10,Abstract:,"Marine invertebrates lack an acquired, memory-type immunity based on T-lymphocyte subsets and clonally derived immunoglobulinsâ€‹. This differs from the vertebrate immune system, which is characterized by somatic gene rearrangement, clonal selection, and expansion and a discriminative ability that includes lymphocytes, among other factors, which impart specificity and memory. Marine invertebrates rely solely on innate immune mechanisms that include both humoral and cellular responses. Humoral immunity in marine invertebrates is characterized by antimicrobial agents present in the blood cells and plasma, along with reactions such as hemolymph coagulation or melanization. Cellular immunity in marine invertebrates is based on cell defense reactions, including encapsulation, nodule formation, and phagocytosis. The cellular component of marine invertebrate immunity is mediated by hemocytes, motile cells that phagocytize microbes and secrete soluble antimicrobial and cytotoxic substances into the hemolymph. This differs from insects, especially ""Drosophila melanogaster, which rely largely on the challenge- induced synthesis of antimicrobial peptides by the fat body and use exclusion, via a tough exoskeleton, as their major antimicrobial defense. The circulating hemolymph in marine invertebrates contains biologically active substances such as complement, lectins, clotting factors, and antimicrobial pep- tides. All of these factors contribute to a self-defense system in marine invertebrates against invading microorgan- isms, which can number up to 10^6 bacteria/ml and 10^9 virus/ml of seawater. The survival of marine invertebrates in this environment suggests that their innate immune system is effective and robust. Antimicrobial peptides are a major component of the innate immune defense system in marine invertebrates. They are defined as molecules less than 10 kDa in mass which show antimicrobial properties and provide an immediate and rapid response to invading microorganisms. There is evidence that antimicrobial peptides are widespread in invertebrates, especially in tissues such as the gut and respiratory organs in marine invertebrates, where exposure to pathogenic microorganisms is likely. The recent appearance of a growing number of bacteria resistant to conventional antibiotics has become a serious medical problem. To overcome this resistance, the development of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action is a pressing issue. Endogenous antimicrobial peptides are exciting candidates as new antibacterial agents due to their broad antimicrobial spectra, highly selective toxicities, and the difficulty for bacteria to develop resistance to these peptides. The ocean covers 71% of the surface of the earth and contains approximately half of the total global biodiversity, with estimates ranging between 3 and 500 X 10^6 different species. Marine macrofauna alone comprise 0.5 to 10 X 10^6 species. Therefore, the marine environment, especially marine invertebrates that rely solely on innate immune mechanisms for host defense, is a spectacular resource for the development of new antimicrobial compounds. This minireview will encompass what is known about gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides from marine invertebrates, covering the phyla Arthropoda, Chordata, and Mollusca."
