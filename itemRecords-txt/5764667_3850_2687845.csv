10,Abstract:,"Ammonia is the primary nitrogenous end product of metabolism in most telost fish species. Ammonia, particularly unionized ammonia, may be toxic to fish. Ammonia production rates of white sturgeon (""Acipenser transmontanus"") were measured at three commercial farms in the Sacramento, California area. Protein ration was the only variable considered which was significant in predicting the mean daily ammonia production rates."
