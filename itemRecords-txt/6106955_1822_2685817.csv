8,Abstract:,"This report describes recent work that relies heavily on PacFIN data for socio-economic analysis of commercial fisheries in Monterey Bay, California. We demonstrate how PacFIN data are used to frame a research question, identify a sample and population, and evaluate results. We apply this research methodology, in a limited way, to the recent West Coast groundfish trawl buyback program. Results show this program had modest effects on total ex-vessel revenues of the trawlers that landed at Monterey Bay ports in 2003 and 2004, with a total loss of about $230,000, or 19% from 2003 levels, but the distribution of revenues among vessels changed substantially. In particular, 4 of the 5 groundfish trawlers with landings at Monterey Bay ports in 2003, and successful bids in the buyback auction, were among the most active trawlers at these ports in 2003, with average ex-vessel revenues nearly double those of other trawlers in that year. These 5 vessels were permanently retired at the end of 2003, which appears to have created an opportunity for other trawlers. The group of 8 trawlers that landed at Monterey Bay ports in 2003 and 2004 saw their average ex-vessel revenues nearly double in 2004 from 2003 levels, while the group of 9 that landed at these ports in 2004, but not 2003, had substantially lower average ex-vessel revenues. These results raise questions about the range of factors that affect trawlers' coast-wide fishing patterns, and how they adapt to and are affected by those changes, and whether similar effects occurred at other ports. These questions are beyond the scope of this report, but could be addressed using PacFIN data, coupled with targeted field research to tap into the experience and knowledge of people that participated in the buyback program, and those that remained in the fishery."
