10,Abstract:,"The marine environment is a rich source of halogenated natural products. Rhodophyta (red algae) produce the most diverse array of brominated and chlorinated compounds and Phaeophyta (brown algae) produce large quantities of volatile brominated and chlorinated hydrocarbons. Biosynthesis of the brominated compounds is likely to be mediated by bromoperoxidase through electrophilic bromination by oxidized bromine species, but this mechanism does not elucidate the origin of marine chlorinated natural products. During studies of the halide selectivity of V-Br(PO) with chloride, was reinvestigated. Results demonstrated that vanadium bromoperoxidase does catalyze the oxidation of chloride by hydrogen peroxide and the chloride-​assisted disproportionat​ion of hydrogen peroxide."
