The 629,291 boats registered in 1984 places Minnesota as one of the top 3 states in boat registration along with Michigan and California. Both the national and state numbers of boat-in-use and registered boats is expected to continue to increase over the next several years. This advisory note includes graphs of yearly breakdowns by boat type and hull material."
