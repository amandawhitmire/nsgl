10,Abstract:,"Organisms of the genus Busycon (the whelks) lay eggs in the shallow waters of the intertidal zone. These eggs must endure harsh forces from wave impacts, abrasion from sand and debris, and attacks from predators. As such, the organism has evolved to produce a unique self-healing casing to protect the eggs. Whelk egg capsule biopolymer (WECB) is an acellular, highly elastic, proteinaceous material that is secreted by the animal to surround the developing embryos while in this harsh environment."
