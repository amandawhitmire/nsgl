9,Abstract:,"Effective management of aquatic invasive species (AIS) risk from recreational boating requires cooperation among the jurisdictions charged with managing those waterbodies. Although preventing the introduction of invasive zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) to uninfested bodies of water is a high priority for many resource managers, actualizing the protocols, standards, and other tools necessary for coordination can be complicated and challenging, especially when the waterbodies in question are managed by a variety of jurisdictional types."
