15,Abstract:,"Significant summer mortalities of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) are common in Matsushima Bay, Japan, and have also occurred in California and Washington. During the early 1960's, these mortalities reached 35 to 50%, prompting an investigation coordinated by the National Marine Fisheries Service in California, Oregon, and Washington (Glude 1975; Katkansky et al. 1972; Scholz et al. 1968, 1971, 1973). The epidemiology of the mortality in the U.S. was similar in character to that described for Matsushima Bay (Imai et al. 1968; Kanno et al. 1965; Koganezawa 1975). High temperatures (18 deg C to 21 deg C) and elevated nutrient levels were associated with these mortalities. Beginning in 1972, the University of Washington College of Fisheries began a study of possible pathogenic organisms and their mode of infection by observing oysters in laboratory- simulated summertime conditions of elevated temperature and nutrient enrichment (Lipovsky and Chew 1972). Mortality was found to be associated with ^iirio-type bacteria. Later studies implicated Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio anguillarum as facultative pathogens (Grischkowsky and Liston 1974) . Since treatment of this disease by use of antibiotics is economically impractical, it was concluded that a logical approach to reducing mortality would be to determine if stocks of oysters could be genetically selected for improved survival during summertime stresses. This study was initiated with the following two objectives: 1) To determine whether resistance to the stress of elevated temperature is a genetically modifiable trait; accomplishment of this would be indicated by significantly greater survival of experimental crosses over imported Japanese stocks at elevated temperatures; 2) To assess the genetic variability within and among experimental crosses using electrophoretic analysis. This would shed light on the nature of inheritance in oysters and might help identify a marker associated with improved survival."
