9,Abstract:,"Since 2004, the Russian River Coho Salmon Captive Broodstock Program has released juvenile coho salmon into tributaries of the Russian River, with the goal of re-establishing populations that were on the brink of extirpation from the watershed. California Sea Grant’s Russian River Salmon and Steelhead Monitoring Program (CASG) at University of California has been tracking the progress of this effort by monitoring coho at all life stages within their historic range. Over the last decade, our program has expanded to include more broad-scale salmon and steelhead monitoring, as well as specialized studies, with the intention of providing science-based information to all stakeholders involved in the recovery of these critical native species. This work would not be possible without the support of our partners, including public resource agencies, non-profit organizations, and hundreds of private landowners who have graciously allowed us to access the streams that flow through their properties. Our program has been hard at work this past year, monitoring juvenile salmon and steelhead on dozens of creeks in the summer, documenting adult returns to the basin in the winter, and operating downstream migrant smolt traps on three streams in the spring."
