14,,"Dressed salmon were held at 0 deg. C in refrigerated freshwater, diluted seawater, and seawater for 7 days, and then in ice for 9 days. Another group was held in ice for the entire 16-day period. The effects of chilling media on selected physical, chemical, microbial, and sensory changes were compared with each system showing particular advantages and disadvantages. Undiluted saltwater is not recommended, however, for storage longer than 3 days, and no fish should be held longer than 4 days if acceptable fish are to reach the point of consumption in a typical distribution chain."
