11,Abstract:,"Structural properites and quality of many foods depend on changes in the state and distribution of food components. However, information on distribution of food components and their role in providing structure has been difficult to investigate in foods. Noninvasive, dynamic measurement of foods was undertaken in this study with nuclear magnetic resonance imaging to simultaneously investigate lipid and water separately. Different relaxation values exhibited by each component allowed resolution of oil and water through relaxation weighted images. This approach is applicable to study of food structure, dynamics, and component interactions."
