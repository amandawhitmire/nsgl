10,Abstract:,"In the companion paper the authors report on the development of predictive models to estimate the probability (P) of growth of one nonproteolytic type B, E, and F spores in salmon tissue homogenate stored at low and abused temperatures under modified atmospheres. The objective of the present study was to test the predictive model approach in fresh salmon fillets stored under similar conditions as in the tissue homogenate experiments and relate the P of ""Clostridium botulinum"" toxigenesis to fish spoilage time."
