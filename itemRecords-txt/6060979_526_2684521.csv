9,Abstract:,"The third volume in the AFS'sea Grant series of symposia intended to develop new approaches to practical fisheries management, this proceedings examines the highly discussed, studied, and debated topic of marine protected areas. Such protected areas are being looked upon as means to accomplish a variety of objectives including, but not restricted to, protection of fish stocks, control of fishing effort, protection of critical fish habitat, creation of spawning and recruitment refugia, and enhancement of species biodiversity. In this volume, AFS and Sea Grant once again bring together stakeholders on an issue of vital importance for the future of fisheries, addressing questions such as How well do they work as management tools? What is the status of scientific knowledge? How do we plan for future such areas?"
