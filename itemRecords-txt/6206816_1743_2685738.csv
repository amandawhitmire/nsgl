11,Abstract:,"In the California Current System (CCS) off northern California, a 35-year time series of seabird breeding success is available from Southeast Farallon Island (SEFI). One of the featured species is the Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), a zooplanktivore which consumes primarily euphausiid crustaceans. In 2005, we observed an unprecedented breeding failure of this species, with zero productivity in our study sites. Auklet breeding phenology was delayed by approx. 2 weeks from the long term mean in 2005, but this delay is not extreme when compared to phenology during strong El Niï¿½o events. Within 2 weeks of egg laying in early May, nearly all breeding auklets abandoned their nests. A small second pulse of egg laying was observed in late June, again followed by rapid colony abandonment. We observed a 100% egg abandonment rate for first breeding attempts. This result is extremely unique in our time series, as many years of low auklet productivity did not coincide with mass abandonment during the egg stage. In the CCS, oceanic warming and unique atmospheric circulation led to a reduction in wind driven upwelling in May during the auklets' egg laying period. This unusual breeding failure appears related to the timing of a climate disruption which caused a mismatch in prey resource availability for auklets during a period of energetic need. SEFI's piscivorous seabird species showed varying degrees of reduced productivity in 2005, but not the unprecedented breeding failure observed in the auklets."
