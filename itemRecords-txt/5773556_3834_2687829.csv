10,Abstract:,"Although many studies have reported specific niches and predictable patterns in geographical distribution for luminous bacterial species, the factors underlying their ecological dynamics (e.g., their movement between niches and their formation of stable subspecies or biovars) have, until recently, been poorly understood. In this review, the authors discuss what is currently known about the extent to which the population of planktonic ""V. fischeri"" can influence, or be influenced by, its existence in symbiotic niches."
