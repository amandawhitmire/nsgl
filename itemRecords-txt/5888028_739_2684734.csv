14,Abstract:,"In the last decade, catches of many central California fishery resources have greatly declined, due both to real decreases in fish populations and to increased regulations enacted to prevent depletion of fish stocks. This book summarizes, for a general audience, the technical concepts and information that fishery scientists use to estimate the population sizes of harvested species. The authors also provide a brief description of the types of fisheries operating in the region encompassed by the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and a summary of fishery management operations from 1981 to 2000."
