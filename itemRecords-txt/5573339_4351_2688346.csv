11,Abstract:,"The statistical efficiency of conventional dichotomous choice contingent valuation surveys can be improved by asking each respondent a second dichotomous choice question which depends on the response to the first question--if the first response is 'yes,' the second bid is some amount greater than the first bid; while, if the first response is 'no,' the second bid is some amount smaller. This 'double-â€‹bounded' approach is shown to be asymptotically more efficient than the conventional, 'single- bounded' approach. Using data from a survey of Californians regarding their willingness to pay for wetlands in the San Joaquin Valley, it is shown that, in a finite sample, the gain in efficiency can be very substantial."
