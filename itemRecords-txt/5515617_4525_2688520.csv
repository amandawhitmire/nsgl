14,Abstract:,"This paper describes a methodology for assessment of the safety of existing steel jacket offshore platforms. The methodology is based on a four-level evaluation process. The first two levels consist of screening of the platforms into one of three categories: `fit for service', `unfit for service', and `marginal', based on qualitative evaluation and simplified quantitative analyses. The higher levels of assessment require detailed computer analyses. Capacity of the platform and potential consequences associated with the loss of serviceability of the platform are key parameters in this methodology. The capacity characteristics are expressed through a Reserve Strength Ratio (Ultimate Capacity/Minimuâ€‹m Reference Force). The consequences are expressed through evaluations of life, property, resources, productivity, and environmental implications associated with the proposed platform operations."
