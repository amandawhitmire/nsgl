8,Abstract:,"Coastal communities face the highest base sea level elevations in human history as the uncontrolled experiment of anthropogenic-​driven climate change continues. Coastal engineering is expected to greatly expand as protection of infrastructure, property, and habitats becomes increasingly necessary. One of the most basic approaches in the protection toolbox is beach nourishment – the practice of placing large volumes of sand on existing beaches to shore up dunes and create a wider buffer from the ocean. The underlying assumption to beach nourishment projects is that they are temporary and will be repeated as the sand washes away over time. The clash between the natural coastal processes of littoral drift and the human efforts to build beaches leads to the framing question of this dissertation – where should sand be or not be placed to maximize the efficacy of a climate change adaptation strategy? The most exemplary coastal engineering projects dovetail with natural features to positively exploit fluid dynamic processes that are self-​perpetuating and universal. For example, using a rocky headland as a protective anchor against erosion is prudent to optimize the longevity of a sand placement – yet most research has been conducted on beaches that are somewhat removed from the effects of headlands. Further, not all headlands are equal, though, and some may not provide any benefits to a nourishment project. This dissertation focuses on the knowledge gap about how sediment moves around headlands. Historically, studies on the hydrodynamics of headlands have emphasized tide-dominated systems through observations and numerical modeling. This yielded an opportunity to explore circulation and sediment transport around headlands located on wave-dominated coasts. Three studies were undertaken to conduct a deeper investigation on the geomorphic, oceanographic, and sedimentologic influences on sediment flux. The first used a GIS-based classification of headlands to identify morphological features common among 78 California headlands that may or may not perform as littoral cell boundaries. The second executed a field observation study at a large headland in southern California with the goal of understanding sediment pathways and patterns under different forcing conditions. The last study was a numerical modeling effort using Delft-3D and SWAN to identify how variable oceanographic and sedimentologic conditions affect sediment transport around four idealized headlands that were designed based on the first study. Through these three studies, headland size and shape coupled with incident wave angle emerged as the dominant factors influencing sediment pathways and sediment grain size determined the volume of sediment flux. The findings in each study were interpreted in the context of littoral cell boundaries, in particular to assess the “openness” of a headland-​defined boundary. Assigning gradations of boundaries instead of the more commonly used “boundary” or “no boundary” monikers became apparent from the results that revealed sediment pathways varied by sediment grain size. The overarching conclusion from this dissertation is that a new set of parameters should be utilized to define littoral cell boundaries at headlands that take into account size, shape, and sediment. The headlands most likely to be candidates for absolute boundaries are large, pointed ones for most common beach-sized sand while large, broad-faced ones are barriers for coarser sand but not finer sand; smaller headlands are less likely to be absolute boundaries in general but can be barriers for coarser sand under certain conditions. The discoveries presented herein expand knowledge of headland dynamics as it relates to particle transport and delineation of dynamic littoral cell boundaries, both of which lead to the prospect of improved coastal management decisions in an era of profound coastal change."
