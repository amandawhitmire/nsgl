9,Abstract:,"In this paper, the optimal regulation of a fishery subject to harvest uncertainty is considered. The unregulated free access fishery and socially optimal fishery are studied in turn. In the free access fishery, individual firms may pursue myopic harvesting strategies if the returns to conservation are not appropriable. The unregulated firm may not only harvest an excessive amount of fish but may also devote an excessive amount of resources to search effort. The regulator of a fishery with yield-effort randomness, therefore, faces the difficult problem of controlling both the search and harvesting activities of the firm. He must try to control harvests which depend upon random potential yields while the degree of uncertaintly regarding the yield is partly controlled by the regulated firm. The traditional policy instruments of vessel quotas and landings taxes are evaluated in this framework and an alternative approach, combining these two instruments, is proposed."
