10,Abstract:,"GOES data in the visible range have been used for quantitative environmental applications such as radiation studies, surface albedo mapping, cloud variability studies, studies of photosyntheticaâ€‹lly available radiation, and rainfall studies. But accurate cloud detection in satellite data over land is a difficult task complicated by spatially and temporally varying land surface reflectivities and emissivities. As reported here, the GOES split-and-merge clustering (GSMC) algorithm for cloud detection in GOES scenes over land provides a computationally efficient, scene specific way to circumvent these difficulties"
