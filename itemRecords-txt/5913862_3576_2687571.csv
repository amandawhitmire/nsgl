16,Abstract:,"Here scientists have characterized the structure, genetics and functions of the proteins that form an occluded axial filament within each silica spicule of the marine sponge, ""Tethya aurantia."" Based on their discoveries of the mechanisms at work, they designed novel block copolypeptides that catalyze and spatially direct the condensation of silicon alkoxides to form organized silica structures ranging from transparent spheres to lath-like structures at ambient pressure, low temperature, and neutral pH."
