9,Abstract:,"In this paper we extend our previous observations on infrared spectroscopy of carbohydrate-â€‹phospholipid interactions with a phospholipid to similar studies on an intact biological membrane, sarcoplasmic reticulum. We show that hydration state of the membrane affects infrared spectra of its constituents in ways that appear similar to the effects of trehalose, and interpret these findings to be consistent with the suggestion that trehalose replaces water around the dry membrane, thus stabilizing its structure."
