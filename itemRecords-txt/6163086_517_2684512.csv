16,Abstract:,"This book was born out of a need to explain to our youngest home aquarium owners the importance of not releasing pets and plants from their fish tanks. As many of the home aquariums in the United States are ""owned"" by children 12 years old or younger, we consider it imperative to provide scientifically accurate, age-appropriate information that promotes environmental stewardship in the best way possible-by creating story books that are fun for families to read together! This colorful illustrated book was created for pre-school through second grade children. This book has been produced with support from the University of Southern California Sea Grant, NOAA National Sea Grant College Program, University of Central Florida, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Tampa Bay Estuary Program."
