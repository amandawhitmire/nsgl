7,Abstract:,"This study attempts to generalize the spatial competition model of duopoly with entry barriers. It assumes heterogeneous cost functions implicitly given, an arbitrary population distribution, and endogenous demand derived from the analysis of consumer behavior. In addition to these general assumptions, it also considers spatial price competition between firms with fixed location by assuming Cournot-Nash behavior; considers welfare implication along with profit maximizing behavior; and compares the efficiency of autonomous operation by each firm versus joint operation by a single authority. Results offered consistent implications for a spatial duopoly strategy."
