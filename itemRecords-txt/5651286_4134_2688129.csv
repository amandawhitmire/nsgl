9,Abstract:,"In the end, there are no clear solutions to the dilemmas faced by scientists seeking to influence marine policy and operating at the interface between scientific research and political decision- making. At a minimum, scientists need to consider and communicate more carefully and understandably the policy implications of their work, and politicians need to recognize the need for a better understanding of the scientific basis of their policies. Thus, while the goal of making marine policymaking more scientific deserves support, there are limits to how scientific marine policymaking can become because the roles of scientists and policymakers are different. Both scientists and marine policymakers should bear those differences in mind as they proceed with the task of governing the nation's and the world's marine resources."
