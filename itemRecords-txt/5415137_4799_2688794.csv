11,Abstract:,"An important way in which cryoprotectants stabilize cells during freezing involves interactions between the cryoprotectant and membranes. Consequently, it is important that we understand the mechanism by which the cryoprotectants interact with phospholipid bilayers during freezing, and the present work was conducted with that goal in mind. Using fusion between vesicles during freezing to assess membrane stability, the authors probed the various modes of interaction between cryoprotectants and phospholipid bilayers using three approaches described here."
