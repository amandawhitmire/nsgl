10,Abstract:,"Historically, the marine bacterioplankto​n community has been regarded as a homogeneous 'black box'. In order to better understand and model nutrient uptake in the ocean, this black box must be further characterized by both taxonomy and function. Here, a novel method for studying the composition and function of specific microbial groups in-situ is proposed. Using a triple-labeling technique that incorporates a group-specific fluorescent oligonucleotide probe a determination of the percentages of different subgroups in a community, and the distribution of nutrient uptake within each subgroup is possible on a single microscope slide. Experimental results on natural marine samples off the coast of California indicate that members of the ""alpha""-​Proteobacteria and Cytophaga-​Flavobacteria groups are a large and highly active proportion of the local picoplankton community. This new technique, named substrate-​tracking autoradiographi​c fluorescent in situ hybridization (STARFISH), should prove useful in the 'dissection' of microbial communities by type and function."
