8,Abstract:,"When fish swim together, it’s called a school. When kids learn together, it’s called a school. So, what do we call it when kids and fish are in a school together? University of Southern California Sea Grant calls it the future. Aquaculture and aquaponics curriculum is not typical for U.S. schools, but with the support of USC Sea Grant and partners, there are now nine schools in Los Angeles that are raising fish in their classrooms as part of the Food for Thought Aquaponics and the Seabass in the Classroom program"
