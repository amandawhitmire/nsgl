10,Abstract:,"A three-​dimensional imaging sonar was developed to track the movements of zooplankton in their native environment. The tracking problem requires a high frequency sonar with a fast frame update rate and reasonably high resolutions in three dimensions. It also requires a small array to minimize the proximity effects of the transducer package on the zooplankton behavior, to allow mounting of the transducer array on ROVs, and to reduce the cost of the sonar. Digitized targets are processed by computer and the results displayed using a graphics imaging package to present a 3-D image depicting the backscatter strength of the target volume along with the location of any objects within that volume."
