10,,"Recent investigation has shown that several marine bivalves can remove organic compounds from seawater at rates that clearly supplement particulate food. This is known because of two technical advances. First, bacteria-free suspensions of marine bivalve larvae are available, and interactions between larvae and microbial elements can be controlled or eliminated. The other innovation, which is the focus of this article, is the application of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analysis of small organic compounds in seawater. Applications of HPLC are discussed."
