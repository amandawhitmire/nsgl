11,,"Fresh rockfish (Bocaccio, ""Sebastus paucispinis"") fillets were blast frozen and later chemically fixed, at either ambient temperature or isothermally, at their respective storage temperatures (-5 deg. C or -20 deg. C). Isothermally freeze-fixed specimens showed better the degree of crushing and distortion of the muscle fiber, deposition of ice crystals in the cell membrane, and the multi-​dimensionality of connective tissue; they also better preserved fine detail. Thus, it appears to be the method of choice for studying the effects of freezing and frozen storage."
