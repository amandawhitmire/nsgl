12,Abstract:,"Fish can generate physiological defenses (e.g. antioxidant enzymes) against damaging reactive oxygen species, however, there are little data tying this to environmental conditions. This study investigated physiological defenses generated by estuarine fishes in response to high dissolved oxygen (DO) and various DO cycles at four sites in California and North Carolina. Researchers caged common benthic fishes (longjaw mudsucker, staghorn sculpin, and pinfish) in outdoor pens, and measured various water quality parameters. After 2 weeks in the cages, fish gills and livers were analyzed for antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase) and the metabolite glutathione. There was a trend towards higher enzyme activities under high DO levels."
