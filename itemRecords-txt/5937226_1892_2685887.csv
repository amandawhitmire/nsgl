13,Abstract:,"Here scientists tested whether estuarine fishes have site- specific differences in concentrations of trace elements in their otoliths that can be used as fingerprints to identify them to their estuary of origin. To evaluate the robustness of this approach, they tested whether elemental fingerprints were consistent among individuals of five different species that were collected from three estuaries in southern California. They also tested whether elemental fingerprints were consistent between spring and autumn for three species at one site. Results show that while otolith elemental fingerprinting can be a useful tool for inferring estuarine residency, such fingerprints may be temporally variable and species specific."
