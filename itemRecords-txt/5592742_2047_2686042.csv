13,Abstract:,"Municipal wastewater from heavily populated urban areas along the southern California coast is discharged into the marine environment through coastal outfalls built on the sea floor. This method of disposal is chosen because of the relatively steep bottom slope near the shore, and because the continental shelf is narrow. These factors allow relatively deep discharge of effluent near the shore and provide more rapid flushing of the coastal environment by offshore waters. Effluent is injected into the ocean as a rising buoyant plume, which is rapidly diluted with ambient waters due to entrainment and mixing processes. The goal of this discharge is to reduce the environmental impact of the wastewater by achieving high levels of initial dilution. An extensive field study was conducted to examine the dispersion of the effluent plume from one of the largest municipal outfall systems on the west coast of the United States (Los Angeles County). This system has been the primary, single-point source for most contaminants of environmental concern in the Southern California Bight. This study shows that the dispersion and mixing levels of the plume depend upon the local current speed and ambient density stratification."
