9,Abstract:,"The myxosporean (PKX) that causes proliferative kidney disease in salmonid fishes is found primarily in the kidney interstitium of clinically affected fish, where it invokes a severe inflammatory response. Incomplete spores are observed in the lumen of kidney tubules in recovering fish. PKX-infected rainbow trout, ""Salmo gairdneri"", were immunosuppresseâ€‹d with cortisol implants to determine if a reduction in renal interstitial inflammation would enhance the development of the parasite. Suppression of the inflammatory response clearly enhanced the parasite's ability to reach to sporogonic stage, but did not induce complete development of the spore. Possibly the kidney tubules of rainbow trout do not provide the proper physiological environment for complete sporulation of PKX and a nonsalmonid fish may be the primary host."
