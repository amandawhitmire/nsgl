9,Abstract:,"Investigations of paternity among marine crustaceans are rare, but the few studies of brachyuran crabs that have been done to date suggest that most broods derive from single males. Here the author uses two hypervariable microsatellite loci to genotype a dozen brooded embryos from each of 10 gravid females of the porcelain crab ""Petrolisthes cinctipes"". Based on the number of non- maternal alleles detected among the offspring, at least 1 to 3 males must have fathered each of these broods, and most females were multiply mated. Using a Bayesian approach, the frequency of multiple mating is estimated to be roughly 92.5 percent in the Bodega Bay population, with a 95 percent confidence interval of 71 to 100 percent of females producing broods of multiple paternities."
