7,Abstract:,"During the next 5-10 years, recreational boaters may be required to reduce the amount of copper that leaches into the water from the hulls of their boats. The Regional Quality Control Board in San Diego is conducting a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) analysis for copper in the Shelter Island Yacht Basin in northern San Diego Bay. They have found that the amount of dissolved copper in the yacht basin's water is well over the federal and state standard of 3.1 parts per billion (micrograms per liter). In fact, there is so much dissolved copper in the water that it kills or causes abnormal development in the larvae of mussels. In order to educate boaters and to track the performance and costs of using nontoxic antifouling coatings, the University of California Sea Grant Extension Program and the San Diego Unified Port District will be conducting demonstrations of nontoxic antifouling coatings during the next two years. They will coordinate their assessments of performance and costs of using nontoxic coatings so a broader range of data can be collected."
