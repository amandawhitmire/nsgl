12,Abstract:,"The natural diet of most fish contains little carbohydrate and hence their ability to utilize dietary glucose may be limited. Nevertheless, because carbohydrates are generally one of the cheapest energy sources and have been extensively used in commercial feeds for domestic animals, there is a great interest in its inclusion in fish feeds as a cost-effective measure. The ability of fish to utilize dietary glucose varies between species. The protein level of the diet may influence the ability of fish to utilize glucose; dietary glucose may also impair their liver function. This study was designed to determine the response of varying dietary glucose levels on performance of juvenile white sturgeon."
