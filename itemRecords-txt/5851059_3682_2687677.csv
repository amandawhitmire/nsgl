11,Abstract:,"Vitellogenesis involves the production of yolk proteins that act as nutrient sources for developing embryos. Vitellin (Vn), often a lipoglycoproteiâ€‹n, is the common form of yolk stored in eggs. Here researchers studied Vn synthesis to investigate reproductive regulation in the ridgeback shrimp, ""Sicyonia ingentis."" They developed and characterized an anti-Vn antibody, and developed an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to monitor fluctuations in hemolymph levels of yolk proteins. The ELISA was also used to determine the effects of steroid hormone injections in adult nonreproductive female shrimp."
