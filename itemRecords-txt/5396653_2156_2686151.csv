12,Abstract:,"Adult steelhead trout (""Salmo gairdneri"") returning to a hatchery near the coast of northern California were found to harbor a herpesvirus (SHV). Specific rabbit antiserum made to SHV reacts strongly with ""herpesvirus salmonis"" virus (HPV). This was in marked contrast to the three other known herpesviruses from salmonid fish in Japan. Studies suggest that the viruses from Japan and the U.S. are geographically distinct and their distribution is seemingly not a result of recent importations of eggs or fish; thus the reasons for the unexpected recurrence of HPV (SHV) in a hatchery in California remain unknown."
