9,Abstract:,"Adult Japanese abalone (ezoawabi), ""Haliotis discus hannai"", were reared under constant conditions to induce gonad maturation (conditioning) with effective accumulative temperature (EAT). Gonad development was normal and showed a progression from 'early active' to 'ripeness' by the end of the experiment. The gonads had increasing numbers of gametes and the gametes were of more advanced developmental stages as the EAT increased during the experiment."
