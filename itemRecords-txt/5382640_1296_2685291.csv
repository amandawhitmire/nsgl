11,Abstract:,"Recent hydrological disturbances, including flooding, dry-season streamflow, and drought, greatly altered coastal wetland habitats in southern California. A six-year study of salt-marsh vegetation patterns during these rare conditions documented substantial temporal variability in plant growth and distribution. Important to cordgrass dynamics were the amount and timing of streamflows, which reduced soil salinity and alleviated stresses on plant growth. Poorest growing conditions occurred in 1984 when both river and tidal flows were lacking; soils had low moisture and extreme salinities. Plant stress was documented in 1984 as high mortality and reduced height. Cordgrass height was greatest in 1980 following winter flooding; densities were greatest in 1983 with summer freshwater influxes. A carbon allocation model is proposed to explain the varied responses."
