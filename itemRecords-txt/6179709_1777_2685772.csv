10,Abstract:,"Abstract: Estimating biophysical parameters of fish populations in situ such as size, orientation, shape, and taxa is a fundamental goal in oceanography. Towards this end, acoustics is a natural choice due to its rapid, non-invasive capabilities. Here, multi-view methods are explored for classification, size and orientation estimation, and 2D image reconstruction for individual fish. Size- and shape-based classification using multi-view data is shown to be accurate (~10% error) using kernel methods and discriminant analysis. For species-based classification in the absence of significant differences in size or shape, multi-view methods offer significant (~40%) reduction in error, but absolute error rates remain high (~20%) due to the lack of discriminant information in acoustic scatter. Length and orientation estimation are investigated using a parameter-based approach with a simple ellipsoidal scattering model. Good accuracy is obtained when the views span the full 360o. When the span is limited to less than 60o, incorporating a prior constraint on possible body shapes can lead to reduced uncertainty in the estimated parameters. Finally, using views that span the full 360o, sparse Bayesian learning coupled with a conventional Radon transform yields accurate two-â€‹dimensional, projected images of the fish."
