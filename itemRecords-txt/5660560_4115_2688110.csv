10,Abstract:,"Planktonic larvae of many benthic species require specific signal molecules from the environment to induce substratum-​specific settlement and metamorphosis. How do the larvae recognize the appropriate environment in which to settle, and how does this recognition activate the genetic program controlling metamorphosis to the adult form? These questions are addressed here in studies with larvae of three different phyla: molluscs, annelids, and corals. In larvae from species representing three phyla, the molecular signals, receptors, signal transducers and genes controlling substratum-​specific recruitment from the plankton are similar to (or cross-react with) those controlling behavior and development in other animals, including humans. Several applications of these findings to biotechnology are noted."
