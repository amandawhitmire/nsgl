12,Abstract:,"The structure previously proposed for suvanine, a novel tricyclic sesterterpene from the sponge ""Ircinia"" sp., has been revised, and includes a dimethylguanidi​nium salt of an enol sulfate and an amended ring-junction stereochemistry​. Reexamination of the sponge suggests that it is in the genus ""Coscinoderma""."
