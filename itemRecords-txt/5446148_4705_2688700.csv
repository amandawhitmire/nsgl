7,Abstract:,"This paper reviews existing information on at-sea behavior and free-ranging metabolism of diving mammals and birds, and discusses the methods available to assess at-sea diving food consumption, energy expenditure, and behavior. Using the limited data available for northern fur seals, approaches for the analysis of concurrently collected data on at-sea metabolism and diving behavior are presented. These include estimation of prey capture success per dive, rate of energy acquisition per dive, time/energy budget analysis, and diving metabolic rate derived from regression analysis."
