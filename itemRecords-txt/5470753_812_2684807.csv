8,Abstract:,"Abalones are both highly prized shellfish and an important component of the ongoing debate over management of California kelp forest resources. The kelp forests, generally organized around the giant kelp ""Macrocystis pyrifera"", from a highly productive ecosystem that supports commercial harvest of the kelp itself, plus abalones, sea urchins, spiny lobsters, rock crabs, and various finfishes. This area is undergoing transition with the recovery of the sea otter, a voracious predator with a high metabolic rate. Within their established range, otter foraging clearly precludes commercial fisheries for abalones and sea urchins. This review discusses: history and management of the abalone fishery; abalone ecology; stocks, landings, growth and mortality; fisheries regulations and socioeconomic considerations and the prospects for stock enhancement."
