9,Abstract:,"The current levels of use of various ocean and coastal resources in California are described briefly. Given the constraints of the paucity of data on this question, the author examines how the use of specific ocean and coastal resources is likely to develop to the year 2000; a brief review of the conflicts between users of California's ocean and coastal zone is developed. The indices suggest the need for a multiple-use ocean management program for California."
