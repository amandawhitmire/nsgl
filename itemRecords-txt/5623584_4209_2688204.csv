11,Abstract:,"Cohesive sediments demonstrate nonlinear behavior, since their properties are functions of the state of strain. It is reasonable to expect that for the same bed material, larger waves will fluidize more of the bottom sediments than smaller waves. This is because larger waves will induce larger strains in the mud, thus expanding the thickness of the surface mud layer where strains are large enough to make the response fluidlike. This implies that the material properties of the bed sediment cannot be set a priori but should be made as functions of the imposed wave height. The purpose of this paper is, first, to examine in some detail this hypothesis, and, second, to quantify the extent of wave-induced fluidization through the development of a nonlinear viscoelastic model for the muddy bed."
