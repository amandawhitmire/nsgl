9,Abstract:,"The aim of this project was to investigate the evolution and genetic diversity of populations of the hydrozoan Janaria mirabilis (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa: Hydractiniidae) and its hermit crab host Manucomplanus varians (Crustacea: Paguridae). Despite being popular ornamental species among marine aquarium enthusiasts, little is known about the general biology and ecology of the stag-horned hermit crab and its hydrozoan symbiont. In this study, samples of J. mirabilis and M. varians were collected from Pacific Baja California, Gulf of California (GoC), and acquired from the marine aquarium trade to be evaluated for species differentiation as well as species host specificity. The mitochondrial 16S ribosomal gene data was collected for both M. varians and J. mirabilis, with mitochondrial COI and nuclear Elongation Factor 1? data collected for M. varians and J. mirabilis, respectively. These genes were used to: a) assess the evolutionary relationships and genetic diversity among sampled populations of J. mirabilis and M. varians; b) evaluate for the presence of cryptic species; c) confirm if host specificity is consistently found between J. mirabilis and M. varians; and d) determine if observed morphological differences between GoC and Pacific populations are consistent with genetic differentiation​."
