14,Abstract:,"Human illness and death from the consumption of toxic shellfish, particularly from mussels, has been a problem for coastal dwellers from ancient times to the present. The awareness of ""mussel poisoning"" (Kal Ko-o) and the preventative measures practiced by California Native American coastal tribes were described by K.F. Meyer, H. Sommer, and P. Schoeholz in an early issue of the Journal of Preventative Medicine (1928). Documenting local indigenous knowledge of the relationship between ocean bioluminescence and toxic shellfish, primarily among the northern California Pomo, they wrote that sentries were stationed to watch for Kal Ko-o, and: ""Luminescence of the waves, which appeared rarely and then only during very hot weather, caused shellfishing to be forbidden for two days; those eating shellfish caught at such times suffered sickness and death"". This critical knowledge had to be learned again by early European settlers as in 1903 the first recorded paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) outbreak in California (and in the US outside Alaska) involved 12 persons who ate mussels from Timber Cove, Sonoma County (Meyer, et. al., 1928). Five of these persons died. Subsequently, 4 cases were reported from Santa Cruz County in 1915, and 12 cases, including 2 deaths, in 1917. An additional case in San Diego County was reported in 1918 (Price & Kizer 1991). All of these illnesses and deaths had a high probability of being caused by the consumption of mussels that contained saxitoxin (and its numerous analogues), a potent neurotoxin produced by the dinoflagellate (Alexandrium catenella). It was not until another tragic event occurred nine years later that state health officials took action. Price and Kizer (1990) wrote: ""It was not until 1927, however, that health officials in California fully recognized the serious potential of PSP. In that year, a major outbreak occurred along the San Francisco coast, extending from Sonoma to Monterey Counties. In total, 102 cases were reported, including 6 deaths (Meyer et. al. 1928). As a result of this outbreak, PSP was made a manditorily reportable condition in California."" Since the 1927 mandate, there have been 542 reported illnesses and 49 deaths attributed to PSP toxins (Price, et. al. 1991). With California's expanding population, increasing recreational shellfish harvesting and commercial production, public health officials are now much more vigilant and proactive in detecting harmful algal blooms (HABs) and in developing preventative measures to protect the public from toxic PSP outbreaks."
