9,Abstract:,"In 2003, California prohibited the discharge from large passenger vessels of sewage sludge, oily bilge, hazardous wastes, and other wastes such dry cleaning chemicals and medical wastes. In September 2004, California enacted three new laws that prohibit cruise ships from discharging gray water and sewage or conducting onboard incineration in state waters, becoming the first state to unconditionally prohibit these activities. This announcement further details these legislative developments."
