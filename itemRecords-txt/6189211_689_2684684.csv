8,Abstract:,"A set of seven microsatellite genetic markers were used to examine the population connectivity of the red urchin, Strongylocentro​tus franciscanus. I compared four locations in California and two locations in British Columbia (data previously published by Miller et al. 2004). I found significant genetic differentiation between the British Columbia and the California populations, however among the California populations there were few indications of differentiation​. I detected some differentiation between recruits and adults within one California population. These results show for the first time that, on a range wide scale, populations of red urchins are genetically divergent. However, on a regional scale, which may be more relevant to fisheries and marine reserve management, there does not seem to be strong genetic differentiation​. These findings do not exclude the possibility that there may be substantial local recruitment within populations."
