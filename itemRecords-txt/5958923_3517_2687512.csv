14,Abstract:,"Atmospheric testing of thermonuclear devices during the 1950s and 1960s created a global radiocarbon (14C) signal that has provided a useful tracer and chronological marker in oceanic systems and organisms. The bomb-generated 14C signal retained in fish otoliths can be used as a time- specific recorder of the 14C present in ambient seawater, making it a useful tool in age validation of fishes. Prior age validation of the yelloweye rockfish ""Sebastes ruberrimus"" makes it an ideal candidate for establishing a reference 14C time series. The goal of this study was to determine the 14C levels in otoliths from yelloweye rockfish to establish such a reference time series for the water and resident biota of coastal southeast Alaska. To do so, scientists plotted radiocarbon values of the first year's growth zone in otoliths against estimated birth year. The initial rise of 14C occurred in 1958 and rose to peak values between 1966 and 1971, with a subsequent declining trend through the end of the record in 1990. In addition, the 14C data confirmed the longevity of the yelloweye rockfish to a minimum of 44 years and strongly support higher age estimates (over 100 years)."
