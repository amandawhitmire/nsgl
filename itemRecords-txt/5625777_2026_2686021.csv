10,Abstract:,"Pickling with vinegar and spices is an ancient and easy method of preserving seafood. Commercial processors pickle only a few seafood species, but you can pickle almost any seafood at home. This pamphlet tells you how. Store pickled seafood in the refrigerator, and use within 4-6 weeks for best flavor."
