8,Abstract:,"Food-borne illness is not limited to seafood, but is a common concern of all food industries. The recent media attention to seafood has led to an increase in public awareness and a number of misconceptions about the safety of eating seafood. The incidence of illness attributed to seafood can be reduced if the public is better informed, understands the risks, and most importantly, learns to prevent seafood-borne illness. When handled properly, fish and shellfish are as safe to eat as any other source of protein. For healthy individuals, the nutritional benefits of seafood far outweigh the safety concerns. Persons with compromised immune systems, such as those with liver disease, can also benefit from eating seafood but should follow a few precautionary measures when preparing seafood (see detection and prevention listings under specific pathogen headings in this publication)."
