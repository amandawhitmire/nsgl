11,Abstract:,"The Caribbean sea whip ""Pseudopterogor​gia elisabethae"" (Octocorallia, Cnidaria) has been found to contain the pseudopterosins​, a newly described class of natural products, which have been characterized as diterpene- pentose-​glycosides. The pseudopterosins possess anti-​inflammatory and analgesic properties that exceed, in our assays, the potencies of existing drugs such as indomethacin. As anti-​inflammatory agents, the pseudopterosins appear to modify the arachidonic acid cascade by an as yet undefined mechanism of pharmacological action."
