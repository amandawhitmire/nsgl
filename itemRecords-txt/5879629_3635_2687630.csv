11,Abstract:,"Researchers present an overview of the isolation and characterizatioâ€‹n of three hormone families important for the growth and development of decapod crustaceans. These hormones include the ecdysteroids (steroid molting hormones), the hyperglycemic hormone neuropeptide family, and the terpenoid methyl farnesoate. Using examples primarily from their own laboratory, the authors describe work on these hormones using various life stages of the lobster (""Homarus americanus"")."
