13,Abstract:,"We investigated the role of sandy beaches in nearshore nutrient cycling by quantifying macrophyte wrack inputs and examining relationships between wrack accumulation and pore water nutrients during the summer dry season. Macrophyte inputs, primarily giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, exceeded 2.3 kg m−1 day−1. Mean wrack biomass varied 100-fold among beaches (range=0.41 to 46.43 kg m−1). Mean concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), primarily NOx −-N, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in intertidal pore water varied significantly among beaches (ranges=1 to 6,553 !M and 7 to 2,006 !M, respectively). Intertidal DIN and DON concentrations were significantly correlated with wrack biomass. Surf zone concentrations of DIN were also strongly correlated with wrack biomass and with intertidal DIN, suggesting export of nutrients from re-mineralized wrack. Our results suggest beach ecosystems can process and re-mineralize substantial organic inputs and accumulate dissolved nutrients, which are subsequently available to nearshore waters and primary producers."
