11,Abstract:,"Free fatty acids accumulate in the membranes of plant cells following several lethal environmental stresses, and their accumulation has been correlated with the appearance of gel phase domains, increased microviscosity, and enhanced leakage of cytoplasmic solutes. Saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids which accumulate as a result of phospholipid de-​esterification have been shown previously to have distinctly different effects on the phase properties of complex lipid mixtures. The objective of the present study was to characterize the interaction of two free fatty acids, palmitate and linoleate, with a well characterized phospholipid, dipalmitoylphos​phatidylcholine​, in the fully hydrated bilayer."
