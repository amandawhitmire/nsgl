10,Abstract:,"The graphite-​reinforcing fibers in many advanced composite materials exhibit a relatively high conductivity compared with other nonmetals. When coupled with a high-​conductivity electrolyte such as seawater, this semimetallic behavior allows electrochemical reaction to occur at the surface of the composite. Many structural metals oxidize and corrode due to passage of an anodic current. Anodic dissolution of the load- bearing graphite fibers could, of course, have catastrophic results. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of stray current corrosion in graphite/epoxy composite materials by using anodic polarization to simulate stray current conditions."
