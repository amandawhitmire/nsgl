11,Abstract:,"The fate map of 2- and 4-cell-stage ""Sicyonia ingentis"" embryos was determined by microinjection of lysyl-​rhodamine-​dextran into single blastomeres. To study the specification of the early blastomeres, they were microsurgically separated and cultured in isolation. The results suggest that the mesendoderm cells are autonomously specified, possibly by cytoplasmic localization at the vegetal pole. The mesendoderm may also function as a signaling region to organize other developmental events."
