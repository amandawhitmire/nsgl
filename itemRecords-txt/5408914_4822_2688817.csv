11,Abstract:,"In preliminary experiments it was found that rabbit muscle PFK (Phosphofructok​inase) is completely and irreversibly inactivated after being frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed. It was also discovered that one preparation of trehalose conferred several-fold greater cryoprotection than did other preparations of trehalose or of other solutes. Subsequent analysis revealed that this trehalose preparation contained a trace contamination of Zn2+. Thus, in this study the influence of divalent cations on the cryoprotection afforded by trehalose and other classes of organic solutes was also characterized."
