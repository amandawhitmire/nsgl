10,Abstract:,"This study used whole-mount immunofluoresceâ€‹nce microscopy to show that pronuclear migration depends on microtubules in ""Sicyonia ingentis"". Unlike most other systems examined, a large female aster formed during pronuclear migration. The behaviour of centrosomes and other structures in sperm and eggs was examined using a monoclonal antibody against mammalian neurofilaments. The neurofilament antibody also labelled a structure in the egg cortex which was associated with the positioning of the mitotic spindle."
