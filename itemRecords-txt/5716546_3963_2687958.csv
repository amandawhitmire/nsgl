8,Abstract:,"Seafood processors use a variety of containers for distributing fresh fish fillets, including polyethylene plastic bags, high density polyethylene plastic containers, tin-free steel containers, and poly bags inside of wax- coated cardboard containers. This study was conducted to compare the cooling rates of fresh fish fillets in several sizes of commercially used containers for fish fillets. Plastic and metal containers emerge as the best choices."
