10,Abstract:,"A methodology is developed in an application to the northern California Dungeness crab fishery to analyze the economic effects of fishery management policies when: (1) the biological dynamics of the stocks are not known; (2) the fishing fleet is multipurpose; and (3) the fishing fleet is heterogeneous. An approach to quantitative economic analysis of commercial fisheries useful for policy modelling, given current limitations, is presented. A simulation model of the behavior of the crab fleet is developed incorporating interseasonal dynamics of the biological population derived from a multiple time series model and intraseasonal dynamics based on a behavioral model of fleet behavior. In the absence of adequate bioeonomic models, a multivariate, linear, time series model of the Box-Jenkins type can provide adequate intertemporal relationships for certain policy evaluations."
