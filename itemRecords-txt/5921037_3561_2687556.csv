13,Abstract:,"The marine bryozoan ""Bugula neritina,"" is the source of the bryostatins, a family of macrocyclic lactones with anticancer activity. Bryostatins have long been suspected to be bacterial products. ""B. neritina"" harbors the uncultivated gamma proteobacterial symbiont '""Candidatus"" Endobugula sertula.' In this work several lines of evidence are presented that show that the symbiont is the most likely source of bryostatins."
