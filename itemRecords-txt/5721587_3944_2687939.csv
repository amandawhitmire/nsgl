10,Abstract:,"The 10""E""-​stereoisomers of hymenialdisine and debromohymenial​disine were isolated from the marine sponge ""Stylotella aurantium"" from Palau. The structures of (10""E"")-​debromohymenial​disine and (10""E"")-​hymenialdisine were elucidated by interpretation of spectral data. The two sets of signals in the NMR spectra of DMSO solutions of hymenialdisine and debromohymenial​disine are due to tautomerism."
