9,Abstract:,"Pituitary adrenocorticotr​opin (ACTH) is a major regulator of corticosteroido​genesis in vertebrates. In mammals, ACTH maintains optimal levels of steroidogenic enzymes and, via the mediation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), mobilizes cholesterol for utilization by the mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme. The role of the pituitary in regulating interrenal activity in coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") was examined using short- (1 week) or long- (10 week) term hypophysectomiz​ed animals. Results indicate that the maintenance of the steroid- biosynthetic pathway is pituitary independent."
