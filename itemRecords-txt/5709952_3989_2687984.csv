9,Abstract:,"Wetland mitigation projects are changing the nation's landscapes, with habitat in one area being created or restored to compensate for damages in another. Ecologists are beginning to document substantial differences between what is lost and gained in the process, and the balance sheet often comes up short. Of great concern is whether either wetland area or wetland functions are sustained by such trades. This paper defines mitigation in the regulatory context; identifies ecological issues under four headings relative to our ability to create specific ecosystems at will: predictability, structure and function, limiting factors, and landscape issues; and points out the declining status of wetlands."
