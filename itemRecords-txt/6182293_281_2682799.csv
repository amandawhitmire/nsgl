9,Abstract:,"Research funded by California Sea Grant contributed to the first successful eradication of an established population of the noxious seaweed Caulerpa taxifolia-the same seaweed that has destroyed the biodiversity of huge swaths of seafloor habitat in the Mediterranean Sea. The success in eradicating Caulerpa from its two infestation sites in North America, both of which were in Southern California, was announced in 2004, six years after the initial infestation was discovered in a lagoon in Carlsbad. The California legislature has reduced the likelihood of a second infestation by passing legislation banning the sale of nine Caulerpa species, many of which were commonly sold in stores at the time of the infestation. This legislation was based in large part on results of California Sea Grant research described below."
