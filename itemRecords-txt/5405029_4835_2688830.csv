8,Abstract:,"This work addresses the planning problem associated with active touch, i.e., determining some `intelligent' schedule of sensor moves based upon a knowledge of modeled objects and the tactile information obtained thus far. Specifically, given that an object is in the environment and is one of a number of modeled objects, the ultimate objective is to determine the identity, location and orientation of the object, using tactile signals only, with the fewest number of measurements. A theory for scheduling sensor moves to obtain tactile information from objects is presented."
