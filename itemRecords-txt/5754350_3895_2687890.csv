9,Abstract:,"The kinematics of prey capture in two bilaterally asymmetrical pleuronectiform flatfish species (""Pleuronichthyâ€‹s verticalis"" and ""Xystreurys liolepis"") and two symmetrical percomorph species (""Lepomis macrochirus"" and ""Cheilinus digrammus""), were compared to test the hypothesis that flatfish have distinct prey-capture kinematics from those quantified for other percomorph fishes. Size-matched individuals of both flatfish species were video-taped feeding using a high-speed video system. Cephalic displacement and timing variables were quantified and compared with data from similarly sized ""L. macrochirus"" and ""C. diagrammus"" previously collected by other researchers using similar experimental methodology. Nested multivariate analyses of variance indicated that there was no significant difference in prey-capture kinematics between flatfish and non-flatfish taxa, but that prey-capture kinematics did differ among the four taxa."
