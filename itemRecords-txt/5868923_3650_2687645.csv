10,Abstract:,"A rapid high-​performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of phosphoarginine (PArg) in invertebrate tissue has been redeveloped and validated. The chromatographic conditions, including buffer concentration, solvent ratio, and temperature were optimized. Separation of PArg in tissue extracts was validated by comparison with a known standard and via enzymatic conversion. Furthermore, calibration data, intra-assay precision, and the detection limit were determined. This revised method is demonstrated using PArg extracted from the adductor muscle of red abalone."
