10,Abstract:,"This study addresses the role of the egg-derived protease in inducing filament formation in ""Sicyonia ingentis"" sperm through characterizatio​n of protease action and localization of the site of protease binding on the sperm. The results suggest that the protease works at a very specific site on the sperm which is exposed following acrosomal exocytosis, and an extended period of exposure to protease is required, in a biphasic process, to initiate filament extension."
