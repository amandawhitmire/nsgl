9,Abstract:,"Spatial and temporal variation in the recruitment of dispersive life stages can strongly affect the distribution, dynamics, structure, and gene flow of local populations. This study investigated the causes of variable larval recruitment to populations of a temperate reef fish, the kelp bass (""Paralabrax clathratus""). Spatial and temporal variation in the density of settlement habitat on a reef, the giant kelp (""Macrocystis pyrifera""), explained much of the variation in recruitment of kelp bass. Although recruitment was positively related to ""Macrocystis"" density, the relationship was asymptotic at high plant densities. Results indicate that density-​dependent effects on plant biomass and architecture (e.g., plant height and structural complexity), common among both macrophytes and terrestrial plants, can grealty influence the relationship between plant density and recruitment of other species. For organisms with dispersive life stages whose local recruitment is influenced by the occurence of living habitat structure, spatial and temporal variability characteristic of such biogenic habitats can be a major source of variation in their recruitment."
