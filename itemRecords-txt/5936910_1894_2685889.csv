9,Abstract:,"This paper reviews evidence for long-term (decadal-scale) change in the physics and biology of the California Current System (CCS) over the last 50-100 years, as well as evidence for stability in planktonic community structure and long-term persistence of populations. Increases in water temperature, thermocline depth, and stratification in the CCS have been accompanied by changes in populations of kelp, diatoms, foraminifera, radiolarians, intertidal invertebrates, zooplankton, fish, and seabirds. However, there is also evidence for stability in assemblages of larval fish, calanoid copepods, and radiolarians. From long-term data sets, the authors conclude that life histories are important determinants of species responses to environmental forcing, even in the plankton; and that the CCS is simultaneously variable and stable."
