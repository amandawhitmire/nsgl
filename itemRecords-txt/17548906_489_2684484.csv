8,Abstract:,"Ormond Beach is both a heavily degraded wetland and a fantastic field trip location. The Research and Education for Students and Teachers about the Ormond Beach Restoration (RESTOR) project demonstrates that valuable outdoor education doesn’t require pristine ecosystems. In the urbanized, predominantly low-income City of Oxnard access to natural areas is difficult. Little green space exists and, unlike a typical coastal southern California city, the majority of the beach is buffered by over a mile of agricultural and industrial land. There are no signs directing visitors to the coast. Just beyond local kids’ reach is one of the most expansive natural coastal areas remaining in southern California. Although degraded, Ormond Beach is an educational and recreational treasure that is largely unknown by Oxnard residents. For the past seven years the RESTOR outdoor education program, led by California Sea Grant, has provided underserved multicultural fourth through ninth grade students and their teachers with the opportunity to both physically and intellectually access this local natural refuge. Beyond academics, RESTOR is a grassroots effort to promote the success of southern California’s largest wetland restoration effort. Ultimately the aim is social ecological resilience—a win-win situation for both residents and coastal ecosystems."
