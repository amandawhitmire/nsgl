13,Abstract:,"We examined krill and krill-predator responses to interannual, seasonal and event scale variability in wind-driven upwelling in the Gulf of the Farallones. We conducted research cruises in 2004 (May-October) and 2005 (February-​October). We characterized the physical oceanography using CTD casts and continuous CT and fluorometery measurements. We concurrently determined the abundance and distribution of krill using hydroacoustics and nets, and of krill-predators (i.e., birds and mammals) using standardized transects. Physical oceanographic conditions as well as the abundance and distribution of krill and krill-predators varied greatly at multiple time scales. At interannual scales, we found that krill and krill-predator abundance was higher in 2004 than 2005. Strong northwest winds resulted in upwelling and elevated fluorescence early in 2004, but these events were delayed in 2005. Anomalous oceanographic conditions resulted in low prey availability for upper trophic level predators in 2005; this was evidenced by massive nest abandonment by Cassin's auklets Ptychoramphus aleuticus, a krill-eating seabird, on the Southeast Farallones Islands and late arrival of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus, a krill-​specialist, to the central California region. At seasonal scales we found that krill abundance was greater in winter and spring whereas krill-predator abundance was greater during spring and summer. High abundance of krill in winter and spring was largely due to the presence of Euphausia pacifica. Spring and summer corresponds to the auklet breeding season and the blue whale migration cycle along California. At the event scale, we found that krill and krill-predator distribution differed between upwelling and non-upwelling conditions. Cassin's auklets foraged in large numbers at the upwelling front during strong upwelling, but were widely dispersed along the shelf break when upwelling was absent."
