11,Abstract:,"This paper outlines and illustrates an engineering evaluation procedure for re-â€‹qualification of high consequence offshore platforms. The procedure is illustrated with application to a Cook Inlet platform that was damaged by a blowout. The analyses and evaluations documented in this paper indicate that the damage was successfully repaired, and that the structure in its repaired condition is fit for purpose."
