9,Abstract:,"Only during the last two decades have scientists undertaken a systematic, worldwide search for commercially valuable chemicals from marine organisms. Only a small proportion of these organisms has been investigated so far, but this research has already resulted in discoveries that benefit the biomedical sciences. Until the development of scuba, it was impossible to explore the undersea world, and even the intertidal zone was largely ignored because it was a dangerous environment. Yet the diversity of marine plants and invertebrates far exceeds that found on land. On a purely statistical basis, we could expect many useful chemicals to be found in marine organisms; however, we must also expect them to be difficult to acquire. This article briefly describes efforts thus far, and some of the rewards encountered."
