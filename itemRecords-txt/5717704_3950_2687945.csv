10,Abstract:,"A necessary component of modeling aquaculture systems is predicting metabolic rates (oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide and ammonia production), as determined by feeding, stocking densities, and other variables. The main goal of this research was to create models for predicting metabolic rates of striped bass and white sturgeon for use in a larger project modeling intensive aquaculture production facility. The larger project is designed to predict water quality in recirculating aquaculture production systems that include a variety of water treatment units. The system is based on the creation of a 'library' of sub-models for different water treatment processes and units. These sub-models can be combined to represent a particular aquaculture system."
