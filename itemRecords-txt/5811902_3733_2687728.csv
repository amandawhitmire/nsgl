9,Abstract:,"In 1998, thirty-eight papers were published in peer reviewed journals describing the antitumor and cytotoxic properties of 35 marine natural products belonging to four structural types (polyketides, terpenes, nitrogen- containing compounds and polysaccharides​). This brief overview provides evidence that there continues to be an active multinational research effort aimed at the discovery of novel antitumor agents from marine organisms."
