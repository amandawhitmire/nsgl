14,Abstract:,"Age determination and validation techniques for deep-water marine fishes include: tag-recapture, often combined with oxytetracycline injection and analysis in growth-zones of bone upon recapture; analysis of growth-zones over time; and radiometric approaches utilizing a known radioactive decay series as an independent chronometer in otoliths from bony fishes. This paper summarizes previous studies (using these three validation approaches) and compares growth-zone and radiometric age estimates for four species of scorpaenids (bank rockfish, ""Sebastes rufus;"" bocaccio rockfish, ""S. paucispinis""; and two thornyheads, longspine thornyhead, ""Sebastolobus altivelis,"" and shortspine thornyhead, ""S. alascanus."" The authors present a preliminary analysis of the relationship between scorpaenid longevities and their maximum depth of occurrence, and discuss the possible physiological mechanisms that might help account for increased longevity with depth."
