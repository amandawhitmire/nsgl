9,Abstract:,"This paper addresses the economic factors associated with commercial production of the white sturgeon (""Acipenser transmontanus"")â€‹. Three major research targets were considered: (1) analysis of the costs of intensive sturgeon culture under certain biological relationships and different sets of management strategies, (2) evaluation of the potential profitability of intensive sturgeon production, and (3) identification of areas for future research which offer significant economic payoff."
