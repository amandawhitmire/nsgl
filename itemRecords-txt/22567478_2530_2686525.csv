16,Abstract:,"Here, we present a range of interactions, which we term “cryptic interactions.” These are interactions that occur throughout the marine planktonic food web but are currently largely overlooked by established methods, which mean large-scale data collection for these interactions is limited. Despite this, current evidence suggests some of these interactions may have perceptible impacts on food web dynamics and model results.Incorpo​ration of cryptic interactions into models is especially important for those interactions involving the transport of nutrients or energy. Our aim is to highlight a range of cryptic interactions across the plankton food web, where they exist, and models that have taken steps to incorporate these interactions. Additionally, it is discussed where additional research and effort is required to continue advancing our understanding of these cryptic interactions. We call for more collaboration between ecologists and modelers in order to incorporate cryptic interactions into biogeochemical and food web models."
17,,"Scientific Significance Statement: Generalizations in foodweb modeling have helped scientists explain and study interactions within the aquatic environment. Established methods focus on quantifying and qualifying these generalizations​, but rapid technological advancements in recent years have revealed that our generalizations of interactions may obscure significant processes within the plankton community. We explore a range of interactions within the planktonic foodweb that are “cryptic” because existing methods are biased against them with the intention of highlighting a range of cryptic interactions and the potential impact of overlooking them in future research. We discuss how including these interactions in biogeochemical and foodweb models alters our understanding of the transfer of carbon and other materials from one species/functio​nal group to another and highlight examples of recent models that have incorporated cryptic interactions."
