12,Abstract:,"The status of circulating growth hormone and prolactin during the parr-smolt transformation and during seawater adaptation of coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") was investigated in relation to changes in plasma levels of thyroxine, triiodothyronin​e, and cortisol, and in hypoosmoregulat​ory ability. In general, both growth hormone and cortisol levels were elevated when hypoosmoregulat​ory ability was high. Conversely, prolactin levels generally showed a negative relationship with hypoosmoregulat​ory ability."
