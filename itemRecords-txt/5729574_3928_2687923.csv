13,Abstract:,"The study presented here examines the early succession of a 2.2 acre man-made marsh located on the Newport River in Morehead City, North Carolina. Infaunal assemblages colonizing newly graded sediments, either planted with ""Spartina alterniflora,"" or left bare, are compared to assemblages in an adjacent natural ""S. alterniflora"" marsh to see whether distinct successional stages can be identified for the macrofauna of crated systems that might be useful in tracking development of artificial marshes. Although macrofaunal densities and species richness of sediments in the lower created marsh came to resemble those of the natural marsh within 6 months, species composition and faunal feeding modes did not. These observations suggest there may be significant functional differences between young artificial marshes and older natural marshes."
