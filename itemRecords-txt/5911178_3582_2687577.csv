15,Abstract:,"Researchers cloned the precursor of a novel peptide from pharyngeal tissues of the tunicate, ""Styela clava."" Its sequence predicted a histidine-rich, amidated 23-residue peptide that the authors named clavaspirin. This report describes the antimicrobial and other properties of clavaspirin."
