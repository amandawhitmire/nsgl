9,Abstract:,"Over 80% of the seafood consumed in the United States is imported. Among this group of imported seafood, more than 40% is aquacultured. Applications of prohibited antibiotics or chemicals in aquaculture raise significant public health concerns. This presentation provides information on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited antimicrobial agents that have been detected in imported aquacultured seafood. The agents include: 1) Chloramphenicol​; 2) Crystal Violet (Gentian Violet), Brilliant Green, Malachite Green and Leuconostoc Green; 3) Fluoroquinolone​s; and 4) Nitrofurans. The FDA has a ""zero tolerance"" policy on these agents which pose direct and indirect health hazards to humans. Between 2001-2007, residues of these agents have been found in aquacultured basa, catfish, dace, eel, shrimp, tilapia, walking clarias fish, and whitespotted clarias. Both sophisticated chromatographic analytical methods and rapid commercial immunoassay kits have been developed and used by regulatory agencies and seafood industries for screening, identifying, and confirming the presence of minute chemical residues in seafood. As long as prohibited antimicrobial agent residues persist in imported aquacultured seafood, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans for processors should include a critical control point at the receiving step when the product first arrives at the plant. Monitoring, a required step in HACCP, for prohibited antimicrobial agent residues (a chemical hazard) can be conducted using rapid screening methods. With seafood consumption and importation continuing to rise, ensuring the quality and safety of the seafood supply is of paramount importance for fair trade and consumer protection."
