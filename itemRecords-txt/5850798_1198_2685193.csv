22,Abstract:,"Elevated levels of enterococci bacteria, an indicator of fecal pollution, are routinely detected in the surf zone at certain beaches in southern California. A multidisciplinaâ€‹ry study was carried out to identify sources of enterococci bacteria landward of the coastline. The authors find that enterococci bacteria are present at high concentrations in urban runoff, bird feces, marsh sediments, and on marine vegetation. Urban runoff appears to have relatively little impact on surf zone water quality, while enterococci bacteria generated in a tidal saltwater marsh located near the beach significantly impact surf zone water quality. The study identifies a potential tradeoff between restoring coastal wetlands and protecting beach water quality."
