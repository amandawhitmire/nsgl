19,Abstract:,"The full primary structure of growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary gland of coho salmon ""Onchorynchus kisutch"" was determined. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of salmon GH with those of four mammalian species revealed several regions that are highly conserved. Some of these regions are also conserved among mammalian prolactins (PRLs). Significance of these conserved regions is considered in relation to structural features of PRLs and GHs that were previously identified to be of potential functional significance. The predicted hydrophobic/hydâ€‹rophylic regions and the secondary structure of salmon GH were also compared with those features of pig GH."
