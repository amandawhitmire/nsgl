8,Abstract:,"Specimens of ""Mytilus edulis"" acquired neurotoxicity upon exposure to particle-free filtrates from cultures of ""Gonyaulax catenella"". Mussels exposed to resuspended cells from the same cultures acquired more toxicity than the group exposed to the filtrate; no toxicity was detected in the controls. Extracts of the cell-exposed and filtrate-​exposed groups were found to contain 950-1200 and 180-220 ng/mL saxitoxin equivalent, respectively, as determined by the fly bioassay. The direct uptake of dissolved toxins may be relevant to observations of elevated toxin levels in bivalves in the apparent absence of toxic dinoflagellates​."
