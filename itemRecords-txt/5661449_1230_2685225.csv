9,Abstract:,"Because of the limiting water depths of California ports, tankers are often too large to enter them, which results in using a large number of smaller tankers to unload the oil from the large tankers and then bring the oil into the ports. This operation is called lightering. The use of a number of smaller tankers increases the possibility of collisions, grounding, operational casualties, fire/explosion, and overflows in the relatively shallow, narrow, congested and environmentally sensitive waterways. A Single Point Mooring System (SPMS) is an alternative to lightering. A SPMS generally consists of a buoy, a mooring system, and a riser. It is usually located in water deep enough for huge crude carriers. This project was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of SPMS for two locations off California. An engineering approach focuses on the feasibility and reliability of SPMS use off California; an analytical approach provides suitable analytical tools for determining the forces and motions of the components of the SPMS. This report is the analytical final report, in which one particular analytical problem, cable dynamics, is studied."
