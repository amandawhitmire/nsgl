11,Abstract:,"The authors' previous study of the energetic value of milk received by pups is extended to simultaneously quantify the female's energy consumption and mass loss, as well as the pup's milk intake and mass increase, to arrive at a measure of the total energy expenditure during a major portion of the lactation interval. The energetic cost to the female of nurturing her pup from parturition to weaning, a major component of what Trivers (1972) termed the period of parental investment, is estimated and the physiological processes underlying this reproductive strategy are examined; ecological implications are discussed."
