9,Abstract:,"Bacteria-free larvae of the sand dollar ""Dendraster excentricus"" and the sea urchin ""Strongylocentr​otus purpuratus"" can rapidly accumulate dissolved free amino acids (FAA) from seawater. Although net uptake of FAA by echinoderm larvae and adults has been established, a clear understanding of the transport pathways available for the entry of FAA in these animals is lacking. In this study, the transport of several structurally distinct classes of amino acids by axenic larvae of ""D. excentricus"" and by adults of the same species is examined. Evidence is presented for the presence of a single broad-scope carrier capable of transporting neutral, basic, and acidic amino acids and a second carrier specific for taurine."
