11,Abstract:,"A biological treatment process employing immobilized microbial populations was field tested on contaminated groundwaters and industry effluent having elevated concentrations of volatile organics, semi-volatile organics and organic pesticides, respectively. Data are presented on the biotransformati​on/biodegradati​on kinetics of specific volatile organics, and organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides. Information is presented on the continuous biotreatment of chlorinated ethanes and ethylenes associated with a contaminated groundwater site adjacent to a petrochemical facility. Process viability of this multiple microbe/multipl​e toxicant treatment approach has been determined based upon comparisons to carbon adsorption technology."
