10,Abstract:,"At the present time, one of the most important objectives of environmental science and policy is `sustainable development'_th​at is, `development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'. One particular area of concern to coastal states is the environmental health of coastal and estuarine waters. Sustained, continuing development of our coastal regions and watersheds requires a long-term commitment to science, education, and outreach activities focused on (1) an ongoing effort to assess the state of the system and to monitor changes that may occur, (2) prevention of damage to the system, and (3), development of remediation and restoration technologies where problems exist. Environmental marine biotechnologies offer promising approaches for achieving these goals and are emerging areas that can provide opportunities for commercializati​on and economic growth. This workshop assessed the current state of knowledge of environmental marine biotechnology in California, cited some examples of environmental problems, and attempted to identify some of the workshop was to promote technology transfer from terrestrial systems, where technology and science may be more mature, to the marine environment."
