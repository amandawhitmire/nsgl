8,Abstract:,"Sustaining and conserving the nation's coastal and marine environments creates an array of challenges that require both technological innovation and active collaboration among scientists, policymakers, resource managers and a variety of coastal constituents. The University of Southern California Sea Grant Program embarked upon this strategic plan in an effort to allow it to chart a course that meets these challenges and anticipates the future. It draws input from broad regional constituents as well as state and federal priorities. We will continue to review and refine our goals and objectives to assess our progress as we follow the course we have set to serve the people of Southern California."
