14,Abstract:,"Hosted by Oregon Sea Grant, this webinar is for students in grades 6-12 who want to explore careers in marine science. Jami Ivory describes her journey to her job as a research assistant in a plankton ecology lab at Oregon State University. Raised in Pennsylvania, she majored in biology at Humboldt State University and minored in scientific diving. She interned at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and at the College of William and Mary, where she built an apparatus to grow algae. She earned a master's degree from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. Jami describes zooplankton -- the tiny animals that make up the base of the ocean's food chain -- how scientists collect them, and why it's important to study them. Taylor Chapple, a professor in the College of Agricultural Sciences at OSU, studies the behavior and movements of sharks and other big sea animals. He describes how he tags them to track where they go and see how they swim and interact with other animals. Raised in Ohio, he did his undergraduate studies at Boston University and earned a doctorate from the University of California, Davis. Lindsay Carroll, who coordinates Oregon Sea Grant's marine education program, serves as a moderator on this webinar, which was recorded on April 29, 2020."
