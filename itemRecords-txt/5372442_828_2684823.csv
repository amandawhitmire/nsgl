10,Abstract:,"This workshop originated in response to a concern expressed about `the validity of the stock concept and its usefulness in fisheries management'. That concern was engendered by a recent proliferation of proposals for utilizing techniques of gel electrophoresis for identifying fish subpopulations. This meeting provided a forum for researchers, fisheries managers, and Sea Grant representatives to discuss this methodology, its application to real management problems, and criteria that might be used to decide among the proposals competing for limited funds for fisheries research. The biological rationale for identifying populations is discussed, followed by a description of the techniques and applications of electrophoresis​. A panel discussion of the usefulness of the stock concept is included."
