12,Abstract:,"Methyl farnesoate (MF) is secreted by the mandibular organs of crustaceans, but its physiological role and biochemical distribution are only partially known. In this study, characterizatioâ€‹n of specific MF binding proteins (MFBP) in homogenates of tissues of the American lobster, ""Homarus americanus"", was achieved by photoaffinity labeling with tritium- labeled farnesyl diazomethyl ketone (3H-FDK). Although many other tissues had proteins which labeled with 3H-FDK, none of these showed competition by MF. This MFBP is thus functionally analogous to the hemolymph JH-binding proteins of insects."
