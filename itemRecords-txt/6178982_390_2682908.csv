13,Abstract:,"Now in its fifth year, the Grunion Greeter Project involves citizen scientists monitoring sandy beaches throughout California for the elusive grunion, Leuresthes tenuis. Hundreds of volunteers attend workshops each year to learn how to observe this beach spawning fish during the peak season. We coordinate the project with our web site, www.Grunion.Org​, in several ways. First, the site provides basic information about grunion and our citizen scientists, with links to news articles, photographs, and other media. Second, we recruit volunteers and show dates of training workshops, community partnerships, and detailed flyers. Third, after training, volunteers sign up for observations at specific times on designated beaches by using a password-​protected pull-down menu. For each date, county and beach site, numbers of volunteers are displayed live, permitting individuals to determine where they are needed up to the time of monitoring. Fourth, the site contains an interactive questionnaire that Grunion Greeters complete after each observation, prompting input on the numbers of fish seen, any predators, weather and wave descriptions, and other comments, stored in an electronic database. Fifth, we post bi-weekly web updates throughout the grunion season with photographs and quotes from the Grunion Greeters, beach workers, and others, providing rapid feedback and a common experience between the different areas of the state. Finally, questions, comments, and results are rapidly exchanged via e-mail. This use of high-tech web-based communication allows centralized rapid, consistent data acquisition from many observers over a large geographic area.
