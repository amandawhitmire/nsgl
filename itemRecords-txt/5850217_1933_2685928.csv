11,Abstract:,"Alteration of sedimentary environments through structure formation and burrowing can have dramatic effects on coastal habitats. This study examines modification of channel bank and marsh edge habitat by the burrowing Australasian isopod ""Sphaeroma quoyanum"" in created and natural salt marshes of San Diego Bay and San Francisco Bay. Abundance and distribution patterns of this crustacean, its relationships with habitat characteristicsâ€‹, and its effects on sediment properties and bank erosion were examined seasonally, and in several marsh microhabitats."
