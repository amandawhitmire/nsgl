9,Abstract:,"Recent Advances and Marine Technology, 2004 is the seventh refereed publication of a series based upon papers presented at the Eleventh Pacific Congress on Marine Science and Technology (PACON 2004) held in Honolulu, Hawaii, May 31-June 4, 2004. A unique process was adopted to bring about this refereed publication: session chairs selected papers based on presentations at PACON 2004 and recommended them for possible inclusion in this publication. Each manuscript was reviewed by the session chairman and external reviewers. Out of 90 PACON 2004 presentations, 81 papers were recommended by session chairmen, 36 manuscripts were submitted, and finally, 30 papers were accepted for this publication. Since papers dealt in areas of ocean sciences, technology, management and policy, we have tried to group related papers to facilitate the reader's use of this publication. I hope that readers will find this volume of 30 papers useful."
