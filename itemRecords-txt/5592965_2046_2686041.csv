8,Abstract:,"In this work, a whole core squeezing technique was developed and used to collect interstitial water samples at millimeter depth resolution near the sediment-water interface. Interstitial water samples were analyzed for trace metals, nutrients and dissolved organic carbon. Dissolved oxygen concentrations and pH were determined concurrently with electrodes placed in-line with sample effluent. This technique was used to investigate trace metal cycling in sediments of two distinct marine environments: the oxygen minimum zone of the California continental margin and perturbed coastal sediments near a large southern California wastewater outfall. Trace metal flux calculations determined from pore water gradients provide data for new theories on trace metal cycling and early diagenesis in the near interface region of these environments."
