9,Abstract:,"The relative effectiveness of two natural cryoprotectants​, proline and trehalose, in preserving membrane structure and function during freezing was studied. Isolated vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) from lobster muscle were employed to study changes in structure and function during rapid freeze-thaw conditions. Both proline and trehalose were shown to effectively preserve the structure (assessed with freeze fracture) and function (assessed by the ability of the membranes to transport calcium) in the frozen vesicles. These compounds' effectiveness in inhibiting freezing-​induced fusion between phospholipid vesicles was investigated; both were more effective in preventing membrane mixing between small unilamellar vesicles than the standard protectants, glycerol and dimethylsulfoxi​de."
