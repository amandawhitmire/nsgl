10,Abstract:,"Potential applications of satellite data (specifically those derived from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner) to fishing and other coastal activities were considered at a national workshop sponsored by the California Sea Grant College Program in November 1983. Those in attendance represented NASA and NOAA as well as the fishing, resource management, and scientific communities. The eleven reports here discuss the status of various Sea Grant-funded research projects on applications of remote sensing and the problems of distributing data to potential users. Hardware development is also considered as is the need for an operational ocean color instrument to succeed the Coastal Zone Color Scanner."
