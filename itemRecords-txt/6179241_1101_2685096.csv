11,Abstract:,"Frontal systems are well known as concentration sites for phytoplankton biomass. However, detailed understanding of the interactions between nearshore physical processes and phytoplankton community structure is still missing in Monterey Bay, especially with regards to populations of toxic species. We surveyed the spatial distribution of dominant phytoplankton groups and toxic species across a semipersistent nearshore frontal zone system in northern Monterey Bay, California, where ""red tides"" are commonly observed using satellite imagery. In this presentation, we report the changes in the dominant phytoplankton from one side of the front to the other, which includes the observation of a toxic Pseudonitzschia australis bloom not more than a few kilometers away from a Ceratium divaricatum ""red tide"". We also describe the physical properties of the frontal system, the biomass differences, and the conspicuous taxonomic changes that occur across the frontal system. In addition, we also compared biomass and taxonomic changes in the presence and absence of the frontal system. We conclude that the observed variability of the dominant phytoplankton groups is a response to the presence of such feature. This particular frontal system appears to act as a physical barrier, separating two different physical environments with distinct competitive conditions which favor the growth of different phytoplankton species. Such fine-scale hydrographic feature may reflect population variability in toxic species that has not yet received much attention and we discuss significant implications of such feature in this presentation."
