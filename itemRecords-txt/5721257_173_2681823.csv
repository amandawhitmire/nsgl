11,Abstract:,"This biennial report presents the results of research activities undertaken by the California Sea Grant College System during fiscal years 1992-1994. It is meant to be a technical record of our accomplishments for use by individuals in academia, government, and industry. This publication contains only reports of completed projects as opposed to descriptions of work in progress. It thus forms an important historical record of program achievement and an important document in terms of program accountability."
