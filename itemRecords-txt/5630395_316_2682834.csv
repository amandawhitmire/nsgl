12,Abstract:,"The genetic structure of California populations of coho salmon was studied. Wild and hatchery stocks of fish were sampled and their allozymes analyzed using standard laboratory techniques. The main objective was to assess the use of allozymes of California coho salmon for stock identification purposes. The genetic structure of coho salmon in California, as well as current stocking practices, indicate that genetic stock identification of California coho salmon from individual streams or localized areas may be difficult with isozyme technology. Differences among coho salmon populations from the Pacific Northwest and California may allow genetic identification of stocks from broad geographic areas."
