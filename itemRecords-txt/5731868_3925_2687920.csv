10,Abstract:,"The red alga ""Polyneura latissima"" is widely distributed along the Pacific coast of North America from Alaska to Mexico in the lower intertidal and subtidal zones. Initial analysis of a ""P. latissima"" crude extract from northern California indicated that this red alga contained eicosanoids different from those previously isolated from marine plants. The promising fractions produced by initial chromatography were treated with diazomethane and then further purified by additional column chromatography and high-​performance liquid chromatography to provide the pure methyl ester derivatives described here."
