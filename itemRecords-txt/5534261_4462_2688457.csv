12,Abstract:,"Most animal eggs are enveloped by one or more extracellular matrices (ECMs). In response to fertilization or egg activation, ECM transformations important to the successful development of the embryo take place. ECMs have been recognized in a number of penaeoid shrimp species; however, their origin and structure have remained poorly understood. In the eggs of ""Sicyonia ingentis,"" four distinct ECMs (the vitelline envelope, surface coat, jelly layer and hatching envelope) are spatially organized and transformed during activation. The purpose of this report is to review our knowledge concerning these ECMs."
