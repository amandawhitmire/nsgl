10,Abstract:,"Teleost endocrinology is a flourishing field of research. This paper provides a brief survey of fish endocrinology applicable to rainbow trout biology, and physiological responses to environmental and developmental demands, particularly factors associated with osmoregulation and calcium regulation. A brief introduction to the 'newer' hormones, which have as yet received only limited study in teleosts, is also presented."
