9,Abstract:,"The functions of the blind appendages attached to the proximal intestine of many fish, the pyloric ceca, have been disputed. Hence the authors have recorded morphological parameters and nutrient uptake rates in the ceca and intestine of four fish species (rainbow trout, cod, largemouth bass, and striped bass) with various degrees of cecal development (the ceca contribute 70, 69 42, and 16% of the total postgastric surface area, respectively). Results indicate that ceca are an adaptation for increasing intestinal surface area without increasing the length or thickness of the intestine itself. Fish ceca are entirely different from the distally located ceca of birds and mammals, which have fermentation functions."
