9,Abstract:,"The ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles form the busiest port complex in the United States. Their important position in international trade is the result of nearly a century of expansion buoyed by the skyrocketing demand in this country for imported goods. Today, expansion of the ports does not have to be at the expense of the marine environment, as it has sometimes been in the past. Even as the amount of cargo has tripled in the last 30 years, the harbor's marine environment has improved substantially and the birds, fish, and other marine life demonstrate that improvement."
