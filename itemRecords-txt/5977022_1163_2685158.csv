10,Abstract:,"This book review begins with a fascinating example from the 'strange world of water resource allocation,' as described by law professor Robert Glennon in his book 'Water Follies: Groundwater Pumping and the Fate of America's Fresh Waters.' By recounting conflicts from Maine to California, Glennon makes the case the American water law as it currently exists is inadequate to address the competing demands of cities, industry, agriculture, and environmental protection. This review, written by Josh Clemons of Mississippi- Alabama Sea Grant Legal Program, explains further."
