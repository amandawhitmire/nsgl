15,Abstract:,"Three novel chlorinated terpenoids were isolated from an unidentified fungus taken from the Indo-Pacific sponge ""Jaspi"" aff. ""johnstoni"". Chloriolin A, a degraded bicyclic sesquiterpene, is accompanied by the new sesquiterpenes chloriolin B and C. The previously reported tricyclic sesquiterpenes coriolin B and dihydrocoriolin C, reported from the terrestrial wood-rotting fungus ""Coriolus consors"", were also present in the cultures."
