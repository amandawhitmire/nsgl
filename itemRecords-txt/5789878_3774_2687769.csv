10,Abstract:,"The authors conducted a series of experiments designed to investigate the regulation of regeneration following implantations of limb tissues in crabs. Autotransplanta​tion (transplantatio​n within the same crab) of the fourth walking leg tissues into claw stumps regenerated either a walking leg-like limb, bifurcated limbs, a composite limb with claw and walking leg characteristics​, or a normal claw. Interspecies experiments involved transplantation of claw tissues from the crab ""Cancer productus"" to the autotomized stump of the fourth walking leg of ""Cancer gracilis"". The resulting regenerates appeared as either a claw-like limb, a walking leg with a toothed dactyl, a walking leg with two dactyls and two pollexes, or a normal walking leg. Most of the regenerates had characteristics of both host and donor limbs. Results imply that both donor and host cells participate in limb regeneration."
