10,Abstract:,"Some exotic species can alter the functioning of communities through interspecific interactions such as competition and predation and through alterations of the physical environment. One such species is the mytilid mussel, ""Musculista senhousia,"" now present along the Pacific coast of North America, where it lives on the surface of soft sediments in bays and estuaries. When the mussel occurs in high densities a mat is formed on the sediment surface. Here the authors evaluate the relative importance of architectural versus biological effects of ""Musculista"" and its mats in creating patterns of macrofauna. They created experimental plots containing combinations of living mussels, mussel mimics, and artificial mats, and then examined subsequent patterns of faunal colonization."
