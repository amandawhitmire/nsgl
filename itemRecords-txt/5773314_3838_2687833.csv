10,Abstract:,"To achieve functional bioluminescence​, the developing light organ of newly hatched juveniles of the Hawaiian squid ""Euptymna scolopes"" must become colonized by luminous, symbiosis-​competent ""Vibrio fischeri"" present in the ambient seawater. This benign infection occurs rapidly in animals placed in seawater from the host's natural habitat. Therefore, it was surprising that colony hybridization studies with a ""V. fischeri""-​specific ""lux""A gene probe indicated the presence of only about 2 CFU of ""V. fisheri"" per ml of this infective seawater. To examine this paradox the authors estimated the total concentration of ""V. fisheri"" cells present in seawater from the host's habitat in two additional ways. From these measurements, the authors conclude that in their natural seawater environment, the majority of ""V. fischeri"" cells become nonculturable while remaining viable and symbiotically infective. Experimental studies indicated that ""V. fischeri"" cells suspended in natural Hawaiian seawater enter such a state within a few days."
