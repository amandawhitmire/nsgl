11,Abstract:,"A majority of the amino acids isolated from marine sponges seemingly arise from tyrosine or tryptophan biosynthesis. Much of the other sponge amino acid chemistry falls into three categories: simple derivatives, mixed ketide-amino acids, and complex macrocyclic peptides. Here this list is expanded with the description of the first examples of medium ring cyclic polypeptides, the fenestins, from a Fiji collection of ""Leucophloeus fenestrata""."
