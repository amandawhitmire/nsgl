14,Abstract:,"This publication examines the status of fisheries in the Monterey Bay region of central California. Even within this single area, the task is complex. Close to 200 species of fishes and invertebrates are harvested in commercial and recreational fisheries in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. And the status of each fishery is influenced by numerous social, economic, environmental, and biological variables. The publication summarizes for a general audience the information and technical concepts that fisheries scientists use to estimate the population sizes of harvested species. It provides a comprehensive description of important species, describes environmental factors affecting fish populations, and examines the issues challenging fisheries resource management today."
