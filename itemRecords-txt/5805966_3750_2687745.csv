12,Abstract:,"Crustacean hyperglycemic hormones (CHHs) are neuropeptides involved in the regulation of hemolymph glucose. The primary source of CHHs has been identified as the neurosecretory neurons of the eyestalk X-organ and the sinus gland. In this paper, the authors report that the cells in the second roots of the thoracic ganglia of the American lobster, ""Homarus americanus"", stained positively for CHH-reactive material. They also identify a pair of cells in the subesophageal ganglion that contain large amounts of CHH-reactive material. Depolarization of these cells with elevated potassium mediated a calcium-â€‹dependent release of CHH-like material from the ganglion as quantified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."
