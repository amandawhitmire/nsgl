11,Abstract:,"Both the biological function and the commercial applications of kappa carrageenan are based on its ability to form gels, which in turn depends on the regular repeating of disaccharide units along the carbohydrate chain. In order to identify the distribution of gelling kappa carrageenan sequences in the cell walls of ""Eucheuma alvarezii"" var. ""tambalang"", fluorescent hybridization probes were prepared. Short kappa carrageenan fragments were prepared, labeled with fluorescein and used for localization on embedded tissue sections. The kappa carrageenan probe labeled cell walls under ionic conditions appropriate for gelation. The distribution of kappa carrageenan gelling sequences was determined for cell walls in the cortex and medulla of the algal thalli."
