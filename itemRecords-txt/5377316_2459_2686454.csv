10,Abstract:,"A technique that would allow the in-situ evaluation of both corrosion and biofouling in heat exchangers, Electrode Impedance Spectroscopy, is described. Electrodes made of the material under investigation are placed in flowing seawater. A sinusoidal voltage at a fixed frequency is applied to the electrodes and the current response is measured. From this information, the electrical impedance of the metal/fouling film/seawater system can be determined. If the measurement is made over a wide frequency range, the complete frequency response, in the form of a Bode plot, can generally be obtained. From these results, an electrical equivalent circuit consisting of resistors and capacitors can be used to model the system."
