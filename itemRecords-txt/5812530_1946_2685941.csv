11,Abstract:,"The authors of this study report that in the sea urchin ""Strongylocentr​otus purpuratus"" the genomic DNA region that contains the SM50 gene also includes a second gene that appears to encode another skeletogenic matrix protein. The gene, termed SM37, encodes a protein that possesses signature features of the SM50 subclass of skeletal matrix proteins. The SM37 gene is located 12kb away from SM50 in the genome, and it also possesses the C, A, and D cis- regulatory elements. In both temporal and spatial terms the embryonic regulation of SM37 is indistinguishab​le from that of SM50."
