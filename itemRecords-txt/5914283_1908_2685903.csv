9,Abstract:,"Ocean fronts occur where water masses with different physical properties meet. The physical, biological, chemical and optical properties can change dramatically across them. As a result, they are often easily seen aboard a ship. This news article explains the usefulness of the GOES-10 satellite, which is geostationary (as opposed to polar-â€‹orbiting), in observing the ocean fronts off the California coast."
