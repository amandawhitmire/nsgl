14,Abstract:,"The salt marsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomy​s raviventris) is an endangered species, endemic to the marshes of the San Francisco Bay, California, USA. This species is thought to feed primarily on pickleweed (Salicornia pacifica), although its diet is poorly understood, and a large proportion of remaining habitat for salt marsh harvest mice is managed for non‐pickleweed vegetation to provide habitat for waterfowl. Using 2 sets of cafeteria trials, we tested food preferences of the salt marsh harvest mouse when offered a variety of plants and invertebrates from the Suisun Marsh, Solano County, California. In a set repeated menu, and unique seasonal menus, salt marsh harvest mice showed strong preferences for food types commonly grown for waterfowl, and also for non‐native plants; in contrast, pickleweed was the most preferred during only some of the set and some of the seasonal trials. These results suggest that salt marsh harvest mice have a more flexible diet than previously thought, and will allow land managers in areas such as the Suisun Marsh to promote the growth of plants that provide foods that are preferred by both waterfowl and salt marsh harvest mice."
