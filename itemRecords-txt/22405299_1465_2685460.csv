10,Abstract:,"The intention of our monitoring and research is to provide science-based information to all stakeholders involved in salmon and steelhead recovery. Our work would not be possible without the support of our partners, including several public resource agencies and non-profit organizations, along with hundreds of private landowners who have granted us access to the streams that flow through their properties. In this seasonal monitoring update, we provide results from our fall and winter field season, including results from coho salmon monitoring at PIT tag detection sites located throughout the watershed and from spawning surveys conducted through both Broodstock Program and CMP monitoring efforts. Additional information and previous reports can be found on our website at http://ca-​sgep.ucsd.edu/r​ussianrivercoho​."
