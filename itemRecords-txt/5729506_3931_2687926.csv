10,Abstract:,"In 1986, New Zealand implemented an individual transferable quota system (ITQ) to promote conservation of stocks and to improve the economic efficiency of the fishing industry. This paper describes the basics of the New Zealand's ITQ system and presents data on industry and management agency perceptions, communication strategies, and actions during the early stages of the scheme. The assessment is based on in depth interviews with industry and agency participants. The importance of effective communication strategies is emphasized. Recent changes in New Zealand ITQ system are described."
