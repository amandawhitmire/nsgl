10,Abstract:,"The gut contents of 169 individual ""Acartia tonsa"" from Los Angeles Harbor were measured during a 24-hr period using gut pigment and microscopic analyses; the intent was to describe Diel changes in the in-situ gut-pigment levels of individual ""A. tonsa"" in waters off southern California. The authors sought to ascertain the extent to which feeding is a synchronous activity in this species and to determine whether or not synchrony is indicative of the level of feeding activity."
