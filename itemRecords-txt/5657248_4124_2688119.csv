10,Abstract:,"The maximum cross-​correlation method has been used to compute both oceanic and cloud velocity vectors from sequences of satellite data. Unfortunately, the two-dimensional cross- correlation functions used in the computation often contain saddlepoints, which can give rise to large magnitude and direction uncertainties in the derived velocity estimates. This paper develops a numerical iterative procedure that combines image analysis methods and dynamical constraints to minimize these difficulties. The resultant velocities are both physically realistic and numerically stable. Thus, it is also possible to compute stream functions and simulated Lagrangian drifters. The advective-​diffusive equation is solved for a few oceanic applications using the derived velocities."
