8,Abstract:,"The antiinflammator​y properties of manoalide and luffariellolide​, which are respectively irreversible and reversible inhibitors of the enzyme phospholipase A2, have caused these and related compounds to become desirable synthetic targets. The common feature of these antiinflammator​y agents is the terminal 3-​alkyl-​4-​hydroxybutenoli​de moiety, which has been found only occasionally in other marine natural products. In contrast, their presumed biosynthetic precursors, the 3-alkylfurans, are commonly found as major metabolites of marine sponges. The authors therefore sought a general method for the regiospecific oxidation of 3-alkylfurans, such as ambliol A, to obtain the corresponding 3-​alkyl-​4-​hydroxybutenoli​des for screening as antiinflammator​y agents."
