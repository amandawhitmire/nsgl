11,Abstract:,"Research partnerships that connect and engage fishermen and scientists to address information needs for fishery management have gained attention and currency. Labeled variously as cooperative or collaborative fisheries research, these efforts can be a cost-effective means for collecting scientific data and fishermen's knowledge, and for fostering understanding and trust among participants. Whereas the scientific outcomes of cooperative fisheries research are routinely evaluated, their ""human dimensions"" are not. Yet both are needed to inform project design and evaluate effectiveness. We evaluated the human dimensions of a cooperative fisheries research project in Oregon and California, using a survey to elicit participants' motivations, expectations and experiences, and their attitudes about participating in future projects. Although participants were positive about their experience, the need for better communication and fishermen's desire for more substantive input throughout the project were noted. We discuss these findings and their implications for designing and evaluating future cooperative fisheries research projects."
