11,Abstract:,"The morphology of the inlets to the Tijuana and San Dieguito Rivers and the Los Penasquitos Lagoon are dynamically and predictably modified by tidal, wave-related, and stream stormflow processes. This study showed that the cross-sectional area of small inlet channels responds to variations in tidal range, and that ebb tidal flows during spring tides effectively remove littoral sediment that accumulates within the inlet. Stream stormflows scour littoral sediment from inlets and restore inlet stability. Bed sediment size is an important variable in determining the ability of tidal flows to scour littoral-​derived sediment from the inlet. Cobble-size bed sediment tends to armour the bed causing inlet instability. The extreme complexity of process-​response relationships requires that field measurements be combined with numerical models to study important high-​magnitude/low recurrence-​frequency processes."
