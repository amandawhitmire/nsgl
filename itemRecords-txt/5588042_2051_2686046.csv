11,Abstract:,"Coastal ecosystems on the Pacific Coast are characterized by great diversity and uniqueness, particularly when compared to better-known coastal ecosystems on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Sustainable ecological systems that lack a current market value, such as wetlands, have received the least research attention. This workshop resulted in a listing of critical research needs for Pacific coastal ecosystems, particularly in estuaries. The research needs were ranked by workshop participants in order of highest priority within each of four categories: hydrology, habitat function, habitat requirements of organisms, and population dynamics."
