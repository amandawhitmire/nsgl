11,Abstract:,"A variant of layered control designed for ease of task configuration has been developed. Intended to be used as the middle level of a three-level architecture such as state- configured layered control, the approach embodies a number of features designed to facilitate configuration of the vehicle software to achieve specific tasks. Examples include moving the vehicle to a defined location or executing a survey grid. While not intended to provide the entire mission planning level for a vehicle, it can provide that function. Implemented on the ""Odyssey II"" autonomous underwater vehicle, it has been used as the mission planner for under-ice vehicle operations in Lake Winnipesaukee and in the Arctic."
