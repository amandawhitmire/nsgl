12,Abstract:,"The general biocide pentachlorophen​ol (PCP) is introduced into coastal waters from treated wood pilings, jetties, antifouling paints, and drilling muds. It has been widely detected in aquatic animal tissues and high concentrations in water have been associated with major fish dieoffs. In this study, the sublethal biochemical effects of PCP were investigated in live, intact red abalones, using a flow-through exposure system, by in-vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy. Recovery responses corresponded to the time for PCP clearance from foot muscle. The effects of PCP were similar to those of hypoxia, fatigue, hypersalinity, and arginine kinase inhibitors, and so sublethal PCP concentrations may also inhibit electron transport and arginine kinase as well as uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in intact molluscs."
