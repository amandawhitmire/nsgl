11,Abstract:,"Since 1979, the development of hatchery and grow-out technology for white sturgeon has resulted in the establishment of commercial sturgeon farms in California. Markets and processing methods for these fish are being developed, and an estimated production of 140,000 kg (2.7 to 5.4 kg round weight) is expected in 1988-89. The objectives of this study were to determine the processing yield for different sizes of cultured white sturgeon, and to determine the proximate composition of the edible portion of cultured white sturgeon."
