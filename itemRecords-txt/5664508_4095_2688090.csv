10,Abstract:,"In the decade immediately following World War II, American fisheries scientists and oceanographers inaugurated a cluster of large-scale deepwater research projects in the Pacific Ocean that would quickly make an extraordinary mark in the history of modern ocean science. The postwar Pacific projects, 'CalCOFI,' a cooperative investigation of the decline in California sardine harvests, the Pacific Ocean Fisheries Investigation (POFI), and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission research program, embodied the ecosystem approach to environmental studies that since the 1880s had been an oft-expressed ideal in the scholarly literature and theory of 'ecology' as a districtive field of science - but an ideal, or model, only rarely carried fully into practice in deepwater fisheries research. This study explores two facets of the history of these postwar projects of particular interest to students of maritime history: the relationship between the rich heritage of ecosystem study - the legacy of ecological research, developed in Northern European and British science beginning in the late nineteenth century - and the direction that the American ocean scientists gave to their Pacific Ocean projects after WWII; and some remarkable parallels between the pattern of historical forces that converged in the late 1940s to produce the new U.S. Pacific research programs, and the pattern that in an earlier era had produced the advances in organization of marine science in Scotland and England."
