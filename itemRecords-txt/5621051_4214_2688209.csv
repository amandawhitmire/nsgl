9,Abstract:,Reliability methods have become one of the cornerstones of development of criteria for the design of offshore platforms. This paper addresses how such methods can be used to develop rational and reasonable criteria for the requalification of offshore platforms. Results from two requalification case histories are used to demonstrate applications of reliability methods and verify the requalification criteria.
