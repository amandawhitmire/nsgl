14,Abstract:,"The papers in this proceedings were presented at the California and the World Ocean '02 (CWO '02) conference in Santa Barbara, California, October 27-30, 2002. They offer suggestions on the progress made to date in integrating and making more effective the protection, enhancement, and management of California?s extraordinary ocean and coastal resources. Topics covered include energy and transportation, education, water quality, ecosystem management, coastal economics, research and technology, environmental indicators, shoreline processes, governance, and fisheries management tools. The conference was organized by the Coastal Zone Foundation, California Resources Agency, and California Environmental Protection Agency. It brought together leading experts on ocean and coastal resource management issues from around the world to help California revisit and revise its statewide strategy, California's Ocean Resources: An Agenda for the Future."
