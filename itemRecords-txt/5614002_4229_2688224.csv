10,Abstract:,"The primary goal of this investigation was to examine the effects of seawater on Mode I fatigue crack growth rates in unidirectional graphite/epoxy; a secondary goal was to examine the effect of long-term static and fatigue loading in seawater on Mode I fracture resistance. Because of its simplicity and low cost in long-term multiple-sample experiments, the compliant load-frame (CLF) technique was selected for this investigation. However, crack bridging and other non-linear effects can invalidate many of the assumptions inherent in the CLF technique. Thus a tertiary goal of the study was to determine the effectiveness of the CLF test method in monitoring environmentally-​assisted crack growth in a unidirectional composite laminate."
