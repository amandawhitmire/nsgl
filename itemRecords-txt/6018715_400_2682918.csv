13,Abstract:,"The goal of this book is to open the world of blue-water diving to a larger scientific community, without compromising the safety of the procedure. It is not meant to impose restrictions on the methodology, but to provide guidelines for conducting blue-water dives, to assist in the construction of a blue-water rig, and to present lessons learned from past experiences. This is a revision of ""Blue Water Diving Guidelines"" published in 1986 by California Sea Grant."
