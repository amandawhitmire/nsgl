12,Abstract:,"This summary report on the California Sea Grant College Program during 1979- 80 focuses on a small sample of research projects that demonstrate Sea Grant's contribution to the development of marine resources for their maximum social and economic use. Sea Grant's contribution to this development is particularly critical at a time in our nation's history when terrestrial resources are declining; when dependence upon foreign imports for many of the essential materials in industry and commerce is on the rise; and when the accelerated interest of the 1960s in the oceans as a new frontier has brought us closer than ever before to meaningful use of largely untapped marine resources. Tapp​ing the sea's resources means making the maximum responsible use of its living and physical resources. It also means developing our technological resources and applying them to the challenges of marine resource development. And, it means developing human resources: today's students and tomorrow's marine scientists and engineers who will seek solutions to the problems of the future."
