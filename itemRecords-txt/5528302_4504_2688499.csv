10,Abstract:,"All living organisms, including fish, can have parasites; they are a natural occurrence, not contamination, and are as common in fish as insects are in fruits and vegetables. Parasites only become a concern when consumers eat raw or lightly preserved fish such as sashimi, sushi, ceviche, and gravlax. When preparing these products, use commercially frozen fish or freeze the fish to an internal temperature of -4 deg. F for at least 7 days to kill any parasites that may be present (home freezers may not be cold enough). The health risk from parasites is far less than the risk from illness-causing bacteria. Some commonly asked questions about fish parasites are addressed in this advisory report."
