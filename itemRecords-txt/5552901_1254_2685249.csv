9,Abstract:,"The growing realization that successful fishery management must be based on scientific understanding of the resource as it interacts with the physical and biological variables in its environment led to a new holistic approach, with the coordinated marine fisheries and oceanographic studies known as CalCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) playing an important role in this transformation. An historical perspective on CalCOFI in its early years describes the state of ocean research when the project first began, the original formulation of the program, and the development in range and mode of scientific inquiry in its early years."
