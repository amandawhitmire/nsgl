10,Abstract:,"The research project presented here seeks to clarify the relationships between cultural diversity and attitudes toward marine animals in order to provide more systematic information to marine and coastal educators and environmental managers. Five groups defined by racial and ethnic difference and gender homogeneity, form low income inner-city communities of color in Los Angeles were organized. Participants provided narratives and anecdotes about the cultural and social meanings of marine and other animals, and of the human activities related to them. This working paper details the design of the focus group analysis."
