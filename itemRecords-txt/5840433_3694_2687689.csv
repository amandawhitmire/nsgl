12,Abstract:,"The ability to introduce and express foreign genes can greatly facilitate in vitro studies of the molecular biology of an organism. In this study, researchers tested whether pantropic vectors could provide a new tool for the introduction and expression of foreign genes in shrimp cells. Successful transduction and expression of different reporter genes was demonstrated in primary cultured cells derived from the Oka organ and from the ovaries of mature blue shrimp ""Penaeus stylirostris."" Of the heterologous promoters tested, the ""Moloney murine"" leukemia virus and ""Rous sarcoma"" virus promoters mediated the highest levels of reporter gene expression."
