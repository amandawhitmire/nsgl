10,Abstract:,"The morphology and pigmentation of ""Dysidea herbacea"", a common Indo-Pacific sponge, vary considerably; some specimens are heavily laden with symbionts that include cyanobacteria and/or rod-shaped bacteria, while others appear to be devoid of prokaryotic microorganisms altogether. A collection of this sponge containing cyanobacterial symbionts, from Papua New Guinea, yielded a new ketide amino acid, herbamide A, along with the previously reported polychlorinated tetrapeptide, dysidenin."
