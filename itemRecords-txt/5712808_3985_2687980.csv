13,Abstract:,"In the present paper the authors present a preliminary characterizatio​n of the bio-chemical composition of the herring egg chorion, of which SMIF (sperm motility initiation factor) is demonstrated to be a minor, but important component. Using an antibody that was generated to SMIF, they demonstrate that by preventing SMIF-sperm interaction, herring sperm motility and fertilization are inhibited. Lastly they demonstrate the localization of SMIF to the chorion using this antibody and document the localized binding of SMIF to sperm."
