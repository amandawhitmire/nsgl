10,Abstract:,"Oyster culture along the west coast of North America is unique among major oyster-growing industries in that it is based primarily upon an exotic species (""Crassostrea gigas"") that does not reproduce naturally in much of this region. Pacific oysters continued to be imported from Japan, as spat on cultch, through the 1970s. Hatcheries propagate closed populations that are reproductively isolated from, and potentially much smaller than, natural populations. Isolation from wild populations provides the potential for domestication and genetic improvement, but it also opens possibilities for genetic deterioration. Results of an electrophoretic study of genetic diversity within, and genetic divergence among, two commercially cultivated stocks of the Pacific oyster and the natural population from which they were derived three generations earlier are reported. Little difference in overall levels of genetic diversity among the wild and cultivated populations was found. There has, however, been considerable genetic drift in the hatchery stocks, owing to small effective population sizes."
