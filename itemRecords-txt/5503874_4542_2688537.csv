11,Abstract:,"Two novel pentacyclic aromatic alkaloids, plakinidine A and B, were isolated from a ""Plakortis"" sponge from Vanuatu. Their structures, which include a pyrrolo[2,3,4-​""kl""]acridine, were determined; the fused aromatic ring system is a structural variation not previously found in aromatic alkaloids of either marine or terrestrial origin. Plakinidine A and B exhibited in-vitro activity against the parasite ""Nippostrongylu​s brasiliensis"", and plakinidine A showed weak activity against reverse transcriptase."
