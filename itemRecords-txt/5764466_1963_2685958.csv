9,Abstract:,"The physical environment within a California kelp bed is modified from that of the region by the large drag of the massed plants. The change is greatest for longshore motions, where velocities diminish with distance upcoast of the leading edge of the bed in a manner consistant with the damping expected for coastally-​trapped waves. Coast-shore velocity fluctuations are more important for the movement of material between offshore waters and the kelp bed interior. Results suggest that penetration of water for distances of 400m into kelp is common. The importance of water motions for ecological processes implies that the size of a kelp bed and position within it are important for the kelp ecosystem."
