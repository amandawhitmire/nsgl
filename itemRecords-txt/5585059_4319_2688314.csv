10,Abstract:,"During storage of Yellowtail rockfish at 0C for 1 week, the solubility of muscle collagen increased concomitantly with a decrease in force required to shear the tissue; the increase in collagen solubility does not appear to be associated with extensive hydrolysis of collagen chains. The cause(s) of change in collagen solubility in food myosystems is not well understood and may involve factors like extent of glycosylation, noncovalent interactions, dehydration, packing of molecules, and location, number, and chemical structure of cross-linkages. Enzymes which hydrolyze the polysaccharide chain of proteoglycans might have an effect on the solubility of collagen. For example, beta- glucuronidase increases. Therefore, this study was undertaken to isolate and characterize the proteoglycan fraction and selected enzymes which might degrade proteoglycans in rockfish muscle."
