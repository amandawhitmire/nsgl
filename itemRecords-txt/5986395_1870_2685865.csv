16,Abstract:,"Ricksettsia-​like, seabass, 16S rRNA"
17,,"An intracellular bacterium originally isolated from hatchery-reared juvenile white seabass ""Atractoscion nobilis"" in southern California, USA, was identified by sequences of the small and large subunit ribosomal (16S and 23S) DNA and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) as ""Piscirickettsi​a salmonis."" Considering all rDNA sequences compared, the white seabass isolate (WSB-98) had a 96.3 to 98.7% homology with four previously described strains of ""P. salmonis"" isolated from salmon in Chile, Norway, and British Columbia, Canada. Experimental infections induced by intraperitoneal injections of juvenile white seabass with WSB-98 resulted in disease and mortality similar to that observed in ""P. salmonis"" infections in salmon. After 60 d, the cumulative mortality among ""P. salmonis""- injected white seabass was 82 and 40%, respectively, following a high (1.99 x l0^4 TCID50) or low (3.98 x 10^2 TCID50 dose-challenge with WSB-98. The bacterium was recovered by isolation in cell culture or was observed in stains from tissues of injected white seabass but not from control fish. There were no external signs of infection. Internally, the most common gross lesion was a mottled appearance of the liver, sometimes with distinct nodules. Microscopic lesions were evident in both the capsule and parenchyma of the liver and were characterized by multifocal necrosis, often with infiltration of mononuclear leukocytes. Macrophages filled with bacteria were present at tissue sites exhibiting focal necrosis. Foreign body-type granulomas were prevalent in livers of experimentally infected white seabass, but not in control fish. Similar granulomatous lesions were observed in the spleen, kidney, intestine and gills, but these organs were considered secondary sites of infection, with significantly fewer and less severe histologic lesions compared to the liver. The results from this study clearly indicate that infections with ""P. salmonis"" are not restricted to salmonid fishes and that the bacterium can cause a disease similar to piscirickettsio​sis in nonsalmonid hosts."
