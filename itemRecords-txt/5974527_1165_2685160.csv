17,Abstract:,"""Toxoplasma gondii"" is associated with morbidity and mortality in a variety of marine animals, including fatal meningoencephal​itis in the southern sea otter ""Enhydra lutris nereis"". The source(s) of ""T. gondii"" infection and routes of transmission in the marine environment are unknown. The authors of this work hypothesize that filter- feeding bivalve shellfish serve as paratenic hosts by assimilation and concentration of infective ""T. gondii"" oocysts and their subsequent predation by southern sea otters is a source of infection for these animals. They developed a TaqMan PCR assay for detection of ""T. gondii"" ssrRNA and evaluated its usefulness in experimentally exposed mussels (""Mytilus galloprovincial​is"") under laboratory conditions. The method is rapid and sensitive, and potentially provides a new strategy for the detection of ""T. gondii"" in wild-caught bivalves in southern sea otter habitat."
