12,Abstract:,"The marine natural product, manoalide (MLD), was investigated to determine if this drug inhibited purified human synovial fluid phospholipase A2 (HSF-PLA2). Strong evidence exists that PLA2 activation exacerbates arthritis, thereby suggesting that inactivation of this enzyme may mitigate the progression of this and many other inflammatory diseases. MLD irreversibly inactivates extracellular bee and cobra venom PLA2 in a time- and pH-dependent manner, possibly by modifying specific lysine residues on the PLA2 molecule. These studies indicate that MLD can inactivate secreted phospholipase A2 isolated from patients with inflammatory joint disease."
