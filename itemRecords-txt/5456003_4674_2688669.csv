8,Abstract:,"Crustose red algae are widely and extensively distributed in the marine environment. Larval recruitment of many marine invertebrates associated with these algae seems to depend on the presence of algal surface molecules responsible for induction of the processes of settlement, adhesion and metamorphosis. Biochemical characterizatio​n of these inducer molecules reveals that they are algal metabolites associated with secondary light-​harvesting components, which are transported to algal surfaces and made available to larvae by the unique sloughing mechanism of these algae. The represent a new class of low molecular weight compounds with neurotransmitte​r-​mimetic properties."
