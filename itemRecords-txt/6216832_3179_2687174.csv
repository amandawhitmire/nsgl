15,Abstract:,"Macrophytic marine algae, commonly known as seaweeds, are a rich source of unique natural products, many of which possess significant medicinal potential. Of particular interest are bioactive compounds produced through the regio- and stereo-​selective oxidation of fatty acids or the halogenation of terpenoids. Cell and tissue suspension culture systems established from macroalgae have the potential to biosynthesize these compounds in a controlled environment at a scale required for continued drug development or commercial production. We have developed several unique photolithotroph​ic suspension culture systems representing all three major classes of marine macroalgae, including a gametophyte cell culture from the brown alga Laminaria saccharina, a filamentous semi-​differentiated tissue culture from the green alga Acrosiphonia coalita, a callus-derived clumped cell suspension culture from the red alga Agardhiella subulata, and a freely suspended microplantlet culture from Agardhiella subulata. The controlled cultivation of these culture systems was accomplished in externally illuminated stirred-tank, bubble-column, and biocoil reactor systems. Cell densities near 2 g of dry cell weight per liter were achieved with mean specific growth rates near 0.2 day-1 for some cultures. The L. saccharina suspension culture system biosynthesized three bioactive hydroxy fatty acids deriving from ω-6 lipoxygenase oxidation: 15-​hydroxy-​5,8,ll,13-​eicosatetraenoi​c acid (15-HETE), 13-​hydroxy-​6,9,ll,15-​octadecatetraen​oic acid (13-HOTDA), and 13-​hydroxy-​9,11-​octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) in yields ranging from 100 to 1000 �g per g of dry cell weight."
