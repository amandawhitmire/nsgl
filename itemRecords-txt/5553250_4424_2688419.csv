12,Abstract:,"The ability of kappa and iota carrageenans to form gels is dependent upon the regular repeat of disaccharide units along the carbohydrate chain. Short, chemically- and enzymatically-​purified fragments of kappa and iota carrageenan were conjugated to fluorescein and used as specific hybridization probes for localization of kappa and iota carrageenan gelling sequences within the cells walls and intercellular matrices of ""Kappaphycus alvarezii"". The probes label cell walls and intercellular matrices under ionic conditions appropriate for gelation of kappa and iota carrageenans. The results indicate that FITC-conjugated carrageenan oligosaccharide​s are useful tools that provide information on gelling subunit distribution."
