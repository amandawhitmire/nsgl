12,Abstract:,"Four viruses were isolated and examined for their serological and biochemical properties, three from chum salmon (""Oncorhynchus keta"") and one from the goldfish (""Carassius auratus""). All were found to be closely related to infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, reference strain VR-299. Immunoprecipitaâ€‹tion of virion polypeptides labeled with 35S-methionine was found to be a rapid and specific method to characterize the virus strains, particularly when supplemented with serological properties and genome segment analysis."
