12,Abstract:,"A homologous radioimmunoassaâ€‹y was employed to assess plasma and pituitary growth hormone (GH) levels in coho salmon smolts and stunts. Although stunts have significantly reduced body weights and lengths, their plasma GH levels were 5-fold higher than those of either freshwater or seawater smolts. Pituitary GH content was also greater in the stunts than in either group of smolts. The presence of elevated GH levels in a group of animals with reduced growth rates suggests deficiencies in receptor and/or mediating systems as the cause of stunting."
