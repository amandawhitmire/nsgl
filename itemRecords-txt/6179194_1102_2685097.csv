11,Abstract:,"Aerosol deposition has been shown to enhance phytoplankton productivity in nutrient-â€‹deplete open ocean environments, by providing phosphorus and iron to stimulate production in general and nitrogen fixation in particular. This project was designed to determine the importance of atmospheric aerosol deposition's ability to support phytoplankton in Monterey Bay, a productive upwelling region, and in waters surrounding coastal California. To conduct this experiment, MODIS satellite images of the Bay were taken from the years 2002- 2008 and were then grouped into eight day time intervals. The three factors tested in the experiment were correlations between sea surface temperature, the amount of aerosol (as determined by optical thickness), and the amount of chlorophyll. Aerosols correlated positively with chlorophyll concentrations offshore of Monterey Bay in the summer, but not within the Bay itself. No significant correlations were found for any locations in the winter months. The trends found in the experiment will be shown and the importance of atmospheric aerosol in supporting phytoplankton production in Monterey Bay will be highlighted."
