12,Abstract:,"Correct measurement of changes in biomass and metabolic rates over time are two essential elements for the accurate construction of energy budgets for invertebrate larvae. Both components of larval energetics are altered by changes in the organic chemistry of the seawater. While the rates of transport of specific organic compounds from seawater have been extensively documented, the metabolic responses of larvae to dissolved organic matter in seawater has received comparatively little attention. The purpose of this study was to ascertain if modifications of the organic chemistry of seawater affect the respiration and growth of soft-bodied invertebrate larvae. Results show that they do; if such modifications are not controlled, energy budgets constructed from laboratory experiments on larvae in altered seawater may bear little resemblance to the energetics of larvae in the field."
