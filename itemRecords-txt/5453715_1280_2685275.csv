8,Abstract:,"Implementation of the California Coastal Act of 1976 has required the California Coastal Commission to coordinate development of coastal programs with 69 local government jurisdictions along the state's 1,100 mile coast. This paper reports on research to examine the experience of the Commission and local governments in implementing the terms of the Coastal Act. It explores the notion of local `home rule' and its influence on local governments in seeking out and pursuing resource values of greater than local significance in the development of coastal plans. The research suggests the extent to which resource values have been successfully integrated into the local coastal planning process in southern California, as well as offering a methodological paradigm for evaluating such complex multi-party implementation mechanisms."
