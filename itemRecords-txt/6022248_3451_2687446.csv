8,Abstract:,"On-shore seafood processing plants in the U.S. are facing public pressure to reduce the organic matter in the processing water discharged into local watercourses. These emissions increase oxygen demand raising concerns for present and future conditions of these ecosystems. A chitosan-​alginate treatment has been proposed recently as a new technology alternative to lower the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of water discharged from seafood processing plants. In this work, the economic implications of treating surimi wash water (SWW) with a chitosan-​alginate complex, used at the optimum mixing ratio of MR = 0.2 and complex concentration of 0.1 kg/ton of SWW, were evaluated for several treatment implementation options. These options included disposing recovered SWW solids, using them for producing surimi for human consumption, or selling them as a feed ingredient for poultry ration formulation in California and the Pacific Northwest. The results of this economic analysis, expressed as net present value, vary depending on the surimi plant characteristics​, i.e., SWW volume to be treated and the length of the operating season."
