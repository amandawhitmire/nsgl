10,Abstract:,"The Maine Coastal Current (MCC) is initiated in the eastern Gulf of Maine, travels westward along the northern and western Gulf margins, and exits along the eastern tip of Cape Cod toward the Great South Channel. In previous work seasonal influences on this coastal current during late winter and spring were described. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the local structure of the coastal current for the late winter season, March-April. The circulation is simulated with a state-​of-​the-​art prognostic finite element model incorporating heat and salt transport and turbulence closure in tidal time."
