9,Abstract:,"Southern California's tidal salt marshes cover less than 15% of their historic area, yet regulatory agencies still permit 'unavoidable' losses, given compensatory mitigation. Attempts to reestablish a population of salt marsh bird's beak (""Cordylanthus maritimus"" ssp. ""maritimus"") and to create cordgrass (""Spartina foliosa"") habitat for the light-footed clapperrail (""Rallus longirostris levipes"") in San Diego Bay demonstrate that each has very particular habitat requirements, and that we don't yet know how to reestablish these species. Creating endangered species habitats and restoring biodiversity are far more difficult than acknowledged in mitigation plans. Even if populations can be locally enhanced, there is no assurance of long-term maintenance of biodiversity."
