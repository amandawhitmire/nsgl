11,Abstract:,"In an attempt to develop a comprehensive list of fishes for California's Scripps Coastal Reserve (SCR), nearshore marine species were qualitatively sampled over a period of one year. Overall, 59 species representing 31 families were recorded. The fish assemblage of the SCR was dominated by species typical of soft bottom communities in southern California as well as several pelagic, rocky reef, and intertidal species. Many species were represented by juvenile or young-​of-​the-​year age classes, while speckled sanddab (""Citharichthys stigmaeus"") adults were present in reproductively active stages throughout the study. These data support the idea that incorporating habitat diversity as a variable in reserve design may serve to increase the function of proposed reserves."
