16,Abstract:,"This report presents background, methodology, and findings from the third application of the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science’s (NCCOS) Integrated Vulnerability Assessment Framework. Building upon previous work done in the Chesapeake Bay, the Framework was applied in Los Angeles (L.A.) County, California. The overarching goals of the project were to: 1) provide partners with the ability to more easily understand the complexities of overall vulnerability and risk within their region, thereby leading to informed management action; and 2) expand upon previous iterations of the Framework in a new geography with variability in demographics, ecology, and climate concerns."
