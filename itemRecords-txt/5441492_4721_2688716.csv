8,Abstract:,"Structural design relies heavily on past experience, a commodity which is necessarily limited for ocean structures, as exemplified by various recent failures. The need for a more rationally-​based design procedure for ocean structures is now well recognized. It is the stochastic prediction of the response of an ocean structure to environmental loads which provides the significant information necessary for its rational design; this area has yet to be fully investigated. The aim of this report is to review the currently available methods for predicting the response of nonlinear dynamic systems to stochastic excitations, together with their relative advantages and limitations, and particular reference to ocean engineering applications."
