12,Abstract:,"Initial steps in the evolution of viviparity involved a shift from external to internal fertilization and the retention of fertilized eggs in the female reproductive system. Even in its most primitive form, however, viviparity is characterized by a variety of new maternal-​embryonic interactions involving respiratory, osmoregulatory, endocrinologica​l, immunological, and trophic relationships. With a shift to maternal dependency, larger and more mature offspring could be produced. Thus, the trophic relationship emerges as a dominant theme in the evolution of viviparity. Nevertheless, the importance of the hormonal control of viviparity, the immunological status of the fetus as a graft, and the physiological mechanisms involved in embryonic maintenance cannot be discounted. Unfortunately, these areas have not been well studied in fishes. Consequently, based both on its importance and on the relative availability of information, the maternal-​embryonic trophic relationship is the focus of this review."
