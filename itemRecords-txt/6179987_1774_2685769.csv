9,Abstract:,"A short-term Enterprise Energy Management (EEM) pilot project beginning fall 2007 through spring 2008 at a California seafood company is designed to explore and demonstrate Best Practices in energy and environmental management technologies to sustain seafood industry competitiveness​. The project objectives are to: Assist in the achievement of sustained seafood industry competitiveness in regional, national and global markets by improving both the acquisition and management of energy and environmental information for effective short and long-term decision making (e.g. operations and financial management, capital investment and regulatory compliance); Provide energy and environmental benchmarking data integrity to use in legislative and regulatory decision making having a direct and/or indirect impact on seafood industry competitiveness (e.g. C02 emissions impacts that may negatively impact seafood national and international competitiveness​); Enable seafood companies and utilities to effectively collaborate, identify and measure energy efficiency and environmental operating efficiency and cost savings opportunities in seafood operations. The EEM pilot method consists of advanced, award-winning energy management technologies to effectively measure usage, costs and C02 emissions at a zip code level on 15 minute intervals. The EEM pilot is focused on electricity with eventual expandability to holistically manage all water, air, gas, electricity, steam (WAGES) resources. Preliminary results will be discussed at the Conference."
