8,Abstract:,"The Rowdy Creek Fish Hatchery (Smith River, California) is the only private, non-profit anadromous fish hatchery in California. The hatchery is located on Rowdy Creek, a tributary of the Smith River system, and is operated for the purpose of enhancing the salmon and steelhead resources of the Smith River. The first statistical analysis of Rowdy Creek spawned salmon was conducted in 1980. Since that time consistent returns of adult fall chinook salmon have entered the hatchery facility each year. The number of adult chinooks spawned at Rowdy Creek Hatchery in 1981-83 was statistically analyzed for the purpose of providing information to better operate the hatchery program."
