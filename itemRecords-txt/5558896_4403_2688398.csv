12,Abstract:,"One of the most critical periods in the life history of an organism is that time span between the ovulation of a relatively quiescent egg and the first few cleavages of the fertilized egg. Results taken from published works and from current investigations are used in this paper to compare the morphology and physiology of early stages of egg activation and developmental phenomena in four penaeid species (""Penaeus aztecus"", ""P. setiferus"", ""Sicyonia ingentis"", and ""Trachypenaeus similis"")."
