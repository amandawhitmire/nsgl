9,Abstract:,"Scientists believe that beach closures due to high indicator bacteria counts are linked to groundwater flowing a few feet beneath the sand. Groundwater discharging to the coast may be as important a source of coastal pollution as the more often implicated urban runoff. Southern California's coastal water quality woes are, in part, tied to groundwater flowing a few feet beneath the sand. According to California Sea Grant scientists, submarine groundwater discharges may be as important a source of bacterial contamination as the more often implicated urban runoff."
