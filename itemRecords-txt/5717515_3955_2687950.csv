10,Abstract:,"Reinvestigation of the ascidian ""Didemnum"" sp. from Palau revealed that the previously reported metabolites, didemnaketals A and B, are artifacts formed as a result of prolonged storage of the ascidian in methanol. Fresh extracts gave a single terpenoid, didemnaketal C, which on methanolysis yielded didemnaketal B."
