9,Abstract:,"On August 19, 2009, the US Geological Service issued its report on, ""Mercury in Fish, Bed Sediment, and Water from Streams Across the United States, 1998-2005."" (http://pubs.us​gs.gov/sir/2009​/5109/pdf/sir20​095109.pdf ). The media was very quick to pick up on this information. But there is no new news to share about mercury in fish. Mercury is a naturally occurring metallic substance. Minute quantities of mercury are in air, water, soil, and all living matter. The study confirms what has been known for years - that mercury is ubiquitous. Mercury was detected in all fish sampled from 291 streams across the U.S. Concentrations in about a quarter of the fish sampled exceeded the methylmercury fish tissue criterion (0.3 parts per million, wet weight) for the protection of humans who consume average amounts of fish, established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Differences exist between heavy metal contaminants of inland (sport fish and subsistence consumption) and commercially harvested fish (includes vertebrate fish, crustaceans and mollusks). State advisories have been in place for years to educate consumers on fish consumption safety of locally caught fish. State fish consumption advisories are available on the EPA web site at: http://www.epa.​gov/waterscienc​e/fish/states.h​tm The USGS study reports that mercury was detected in all fish in the study and that concentrations at 27 percent of sampled sites exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency human-health criterion of 0.3 micrograms per gram wet weight. The study design targeted specific sites (including a basin with known mercury contamination from historical gold mining) and fish species and sizes, so results do not represent a true nationwide percentage of exceedances. The most commonly collected fish were largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides;), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), brown trout (Salmo trutta), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), spotted bass (Micropterus punctulatus), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii), and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Mercury comparisons across species should be viewed with caution as different species accumulate mercury at different rates, and concentrations generally increase with increasing age or length of the fish. To the untrained eye, the headline may imply that mercury in seafood is a problem. This is an ""apples and oranges"" situation between commercial and sport-caught fish. The information presented in the study relates to fish that are typically recreationally caught. Commercially caught and sold fish (includes finfish, shellfish and mollusks) is safe and beneficial to consume."
