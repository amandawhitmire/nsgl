10,Abstract:,"The effect of fish density in a rearing tank is important in fish farming from both technical and economic viewpoints. Many authors studying group metabolism of fishes have found significant differences between the individual routine metabolism of single and grouped fish, but the causes are not clearly understood. The response of the white sturgeon to crowding is unknown. The objective here was to better understand the effect of stocking density on the metabolism of captive white sturgeon by determining its oxygen requirements and activity levels under various conditions of feeding/handlinâ€‹g and dissolved oxygen. To conduct these experiments, a respirometry method adapted to large size fish was developed which simulates farming conditions."
