10,Abstract:,"A total of 48 satellite images of the California Current system were analyzed to produce seasonal averages and variances, gradients, and power spectra of chlorophyll plus phaeopigments. Roughly a third to a half of the variance in pigment biomass can be explained by consistent, large-scale gradients. In general, biomass is higher in the north and in nearshore areas. Nearshore areas also have proportionally more small-scale variability than the areas offshore. Results suggest that biological processes dominate the smaller scales, while mesoscale eddies and geostrophic currents dominate the larger scales."
