11,Abstract:,"Although hybridization between species of fish is a common phenomenon, natural hybridization between chinook salmon ""Oncorhynchus tshawytscha"" and coho salmon ""O. kisutch"" is extremely rare. The presence of hybrid fish in the wild has implications for fisheries biology. The mixing of gene pools among natural populations or the introduction of hybrids into the wild can affect the size and genetic structure of parental populations through competition, introgression, and reduced mating efficiency. During an extensive description of the genetic structure of chinook and coho salmon populations in California, the authors found genetic evidence of hybridization between these two species in wild and hatchery populations. The identification of chinook and coho salmon hybrids by use of allozymes detected by horizontal starch gel electrophoresis is reported here."
