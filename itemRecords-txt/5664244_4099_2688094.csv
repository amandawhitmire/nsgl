16,Abstract:,"The ascidian ""Lissoclinum japonicum"" from Palau contained the antimicrobial and antifungal metabolites varacin and the corresponding trithiane, both of which were isolated as the trifluoroacetat​e salts. An inseparable 2:3 mixture of 5- (methylthio)var​acin and the corresponding trithiane was isolated from a different ""Lissoclinum"" species from Pohnpei, and 3,4- desmethylvaraci​n, isolated as the trifluoroacetat​e salt, was obtained from a species of ""Eudistoma"" from Pohnpei. The pentathiepins and trithianes selectively inhibit protein kinase C."
