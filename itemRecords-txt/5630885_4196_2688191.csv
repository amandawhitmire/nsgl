11,Abstract:,"Available data on the performance of marine systems during the last two decades indicates that approximately 65% of catastrophic marine related accidents are the result of compounded human and organizational errors (HOE) during operations. This paper examines methodologies used to mitigate the impacts of HOE during operations of offshore structures. A case study of the ""Piper Alpha"" disaster is used to illustrate examination of the effects of HOE in simultaneous offshore maintenance and production operations of high pressure gas systems. Influence diagrams are developed to illustrate the interactions of the multiple accident events, decisions, and actions and to evaluate their contributing HOE factors. The models are used to examine HOE management alternatives to reduce the likelihood of failure events."
