10,Abstract:,"A new ""Eunicea"" species collected in the Tobago Cays, eastern Caribbean Sea, is chemically distinct from all other members of this genus. It yielded eunicenones A and B, compounds of a mixed biosynthetic origin. The new compounds are diterpenoid cyclohexenones of a new skeletal class related in part to the linear diterpenoid-​substituted quinones and hydroquinones isolated from various plants and animals."
