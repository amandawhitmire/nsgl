9,Abstract:,"The impact of storm conditions on offshore operations can be potentially hazardous for work crews. Adverse weather has resulted in compounding a number of catastrophic accidents which could have been avoided if effective evacuation procedures were in place. Weather conditions can deteriorate rapidly, and timely decisions are critical to reduce the potential consequences of a platform failure. This is particularly crucial in areas with high storm intensity and low predictability (i.e. North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, South China Sea, etc.). Developing frameworks for modeling operational and evacuation systems for various weather conditions can assist in creating decision criteria for evacuations. This paper addresses the development of such a framework and evaluation of various decisions using probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) modeling techniques."
