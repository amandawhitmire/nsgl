9,Abstract:,"The food-catching proboscis apparatus is both a unique and a visibly outstanding feature of the Nemertea. The feeding biology of these worms shows them to be elegantly adapted in behavior, physiology and morphology to the particular foods they eat, and they are consequently integral and potentially important members of natural communities. In this paper these adaptive strategies are discussed in four parts: foods, patterns of feeding behavior, the role of dissolved organic material in nemertean nutrition, and feeding ecology. Areas of research needed before the importance of nemerteans can be appreciated are suggested."
