10,Abstract:,"Maintenance and improvement of the salmon fishery have been for many years a matter of great concern on both sides of the North Pacific. With this concern has come the need to understand the biology of salmonid species, especially of the genus ""Oncorhynchus"". This essay, intended as a tribute to the value of Japanese-North American scientific interdependence and to the accomplishments of Japanese salmon biologists, deals with the physiology and especially the endocrinology of salmon as they relate to their development, growth and environmental adaptability."
