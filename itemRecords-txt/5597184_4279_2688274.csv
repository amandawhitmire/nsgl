11,Abstract:,"Work was initiated on the crude extract of a small collection of ""Notodoris gardineri"", a common Indo-Pacific nudibranch, which registered potent in-vitro activity at 50 microgram/mL against the parasite ""Nippostrongylu​s brasiliensis"". The anthelminthic extract yielded dorimidazole A, accompanied by the known compound isonaamine A. Overall structures were established with the aid of spectral data. New insights on the biogenesis of sponge-derived amino imidazoles are provided by the structure of the former."
