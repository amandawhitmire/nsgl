11,Abstract:,"Sandy beach ecosystems are perched at the dynamic boundary of land and sea with important functional links to both. Beach ecosystems are strongly influenced by marine and terrestrial processes and make up a part of a large system comprised of surf zone, beach, and backshore. The sand in this linked system is constantly moved by the forces of winds, waves, currents, and tides. Although restricted to a narrow strip running along the coast, sandy beaches are iconic assets highly valued by society for recreation, aesthetics, and cultural identity. Beaches sit high on the list of desirable places to visit, support vibrant coastal towns and cities, and annually contribute billions of dollars to the California economy. However, compared with their high socioeconomic values, the unique biodiversity and ecological functions and resources supported by sandy beach ecosystems are often underappreciateâ€‹d (Schlacher et al. 2007, 2014). Intrinsic ecological roles and functions of sandy beach ecosystems in California include rich invertebrate communities that serve as prey for birds and fish, buffering and adsorption of wave energy by stored sand, filtration of large volumes of seawater, extensive detrital and wrack processing and nutrient recycling, and provision of critical habitat and resources for declining and endangered wilderlife, such as shorebirds and pinnipeds."
