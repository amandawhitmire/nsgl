11,Abstract:,"A series of experiments tested shell recognition ability of the hermit crab ""Pagurus samuelis"". When presented with a choice between its original shell and another matched gastropod shell not previously inhabited by a hermit crab, ""P. samuelis"" chose its original shell. However, when a crab was presented with a choice between its boiled original shell and a boiled shell without prior hermit crab inhabitants, or the boiled shell of another crab, it lost its preference for its original shell. These experiments indicate that preference for the original shell by the crab is dependent on chemical, but not visual cues."
