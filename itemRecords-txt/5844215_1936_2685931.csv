11,Abstract:,"In this study researchers used an existing model in an initial examination of the effects of marine harvest refugia, i.e. protected areas where fishing is prohibited, on the bocaccio rockfish (""Sebastes paucispinis"") population off central and northern California. They incorporated size-specific life history information into the model, including growth, survival, and fecundity, and examined the long-term fisheries consequences of refugia. The key assumptions of the model were that larvae dispersed widely from their areas of origin and adults remained in the areas where they settled. The authors discuss predictions based on this model and the implications in fisheries management."
