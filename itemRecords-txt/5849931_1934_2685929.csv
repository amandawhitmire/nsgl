11,Abstract:,"Sediment-â€‹dwelling fauna are a ubiquitous component of salt marshes yet there is limited understanding of their roles in marsh functioning and of the environmental conditions that control their distributions and abundances. This paper examines the influence of vegetation (presence, type, density, and biomass) and other environmental variables (marsh age, sediment and porewater properties, elevation, flow, oxygen, and biogenic structures) on salt marsh macrofauna and meiofauna. The authors review studies from a variety of locations including new information from systems with adjacent natural and restored sites in southern California."
