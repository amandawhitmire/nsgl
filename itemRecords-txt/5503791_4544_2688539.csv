13,Abstract:,"The thyroid and its hormones, thyroxin (T4) and triiodothyronin​e (T3), have been implicated as important regulators of early development in teleosts. T4 and T3 are present in various developing teleost eggs and larvae. This study provides developmental profiles of both T4 and T3 in the eggs, whole larvae, larval yolk-only and larval body-only of coho and chinook salmon. An attempt has been made to determine at which point in the development of these species the embryo's own thyroid hormone synthesis begins, and the compartmentaliz​ation of the hormones between the yolk and body of the larva has been measured."
