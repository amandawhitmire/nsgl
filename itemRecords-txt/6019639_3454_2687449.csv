11,Abstract:,"The decline of Pacific salmon has had its full share of controversy and conflict. Certainly one of the most controversial incidents in recent years was the die-off of an estimated 34,000 fish in the Klamath River in September 2002. Although this loss was dramatic because it involved adult fish, the epidemic drew attention to the chronic disease issues that affect the health of migrating juvenile fish. What should be done to improve the health of these fish and insure that such incidents don't recur is a question with consequences for the farmers, fishers, and communities that depend on the river's water in Oregon and California, as well as for the tribes and agencies that manage the river. Fish disease issues in the Klamath River are complicated. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), in its report on the 2002 fish die-off, concluded that a ""combination of factors"" caused it, specifically, ""high density offish, low [river] discharges, warm water temperatures, and possible extended residence time of salmon [which] created optimal conditions for parasite proliferation."" An epidemic outbreak of two pathogens, Ich {Ichthyophthiri​us multifi- liis) and columnaris {Flavobacterium columnare), was the ""proximate cause of death,"" the agency said. However, fish health-​monitoring studies conducted by the USFWS show that mortality in juvenile salmon results primarily from infections caused by myxozoan parasites. As many as 45 percent of juvenile Chinook salmon captured in 2004 in the lower Klamath River were infected with one particularly injurious species, Ceratomyxa shasta, which infects the intestine. Prevalence of infection by another myxozoan, Parvicapsula minibicornis, which infects the kidney, can be greater than 90 percent. Infection can reach 100 percent for both parasites in fish migrating during spring."
