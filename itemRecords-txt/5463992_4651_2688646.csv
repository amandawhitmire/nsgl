9,Abstract:,"Commercial fishermen complete intensely for common property resources. Difficult-​to-​predict changes in regulations, resource abundance, and prices add much uncertainty to the environment of fishermen trying to catch fish before they are caught by competing fishermen. Decisions about adopting or rejecting innovations by fishermen are critical, and have important impacts on the fishermen's own businesses, as well as on resource abundance, other fishermen, and agencies managing fisheries resources. The purpose of this study is to test a new model of innovation adoption/nonado​ption and to gain insight into the technical innovation process in commercial fisheries. This model differs from previous ones in that it incorporates both the personal characteristics of potential adopters and the characteristics of innovations as perceived by potential adopters to explain adoption or nonadoption of new technologies."
