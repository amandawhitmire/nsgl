8,Abstract:,The biological assumptions associated with fishery management are discussed within the framework of three problems of increasing complexity. The first is the use of egg or larval surveys to estimate spawning biomass and the associated questions about modelling aggregation. The second is management of krill in the Antarctic and the relationship between catch per unit effort and stock abundance. The importance of behavioral models in fishery management is discussed. The third topic is the management of multiple pelagic species in California coastal waters and the need for the development of community ecology models for the California Current.
