10,Abstract:,"The Presidential proclamation extending the territorial sea from three to twelve nautical miles creates a new zone nine nautical miles wide extending to the territorial sea's baseline. This creates an opportunity for a new era of federal/state and interstate coordination in managing marine fishery resources. The proclamation could have significant domestic legal implications. The territorial sea proclamation itself does not extend the coastal state's seaward boundaries. This paper outlines the state/federal relationship in marine fisheries management before and after enactment of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and analyzes this relationship in view of an extended territorial sea. Alternative approaches to restructuring the state/federal relationship in marine fisheries management are presented."
