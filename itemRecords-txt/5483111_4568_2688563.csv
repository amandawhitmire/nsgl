9,Abstract:,"This paper describes a method of constructing multidimensionaâ€‹l models of the undersea environment with real-time multisensor data. The basis of this approach is to divide the space into small cubical units, each of which has a multisensor feature vector that represents the properties within the region. New sensor data are merged to continuously update the image."
