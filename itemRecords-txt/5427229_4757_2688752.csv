11,Abstract:,People interested in economic stability or economic development in coastal communities are often interested in estimating the impact of changes or proposed changes on the economy. Economic input/output (I/O) models are often used to estimate the impact of resource changes or to calculate the contributions of an industry to local economies. This publication is designed both as an introduction to input/output models and as a guide to the proper use of economic impact terminology. It grew out of concerns about the lack of understanding and improper use of I/O models. This lack of understanding or misuse is especially troublesome in situations where groups with opposing views come up with very different estimates of economic impacts.
