12,Abstract:,A census of marine mammals was conducted off the coast of California in 1979-1980; surface chlorophyll was determined at the same time by onboard fluorometry and by remote sensing. Comparisons of species and chlorophyll distributions indicate that marine mammals are not randomly distributed with respect to chlorophyll. Cetaceans were more abundant in the productive coastal waters than in the offshore oceanic waters of the California Current. This supports the hypothesis that the distributions of some cetacean species may be related to mesoscale features manifest in the chlorophyll patterns as revealed in satellite imagery. Remote sensing may provide complimentary data useful in the interpretation of observed distribution patterns of marine mammals and in the estimation of their abundance.
