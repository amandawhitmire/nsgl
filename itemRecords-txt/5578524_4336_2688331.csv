11,Abstract:,"Air exposure (less than or equal to 1 hr during a normal tidal cycle) represents a hypoxic stress to red abalones; the effects of this were investigated using a flow-through exposure system and in vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy, which allows measurement of the biochemical effects of natural stress factors in live, intact aquatic organisms in the laboratory. In foot muscle, hypoxia produced a decrease in phosphoarginine concentration and intracellular pH, an increase in inorganic monophosphate concentration, and no change in that of ATP; upon resubmergence, all effects generally recovered. The changes induced are consistent with the blockage of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation​."
