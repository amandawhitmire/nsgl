10,Abstract:,"One of the major consequences of the negotiations at the third United Nations Law of the Sea conference was a substantial reduction of the international commons in which the freedom to fish existed and the creation of what was supposed to be a sui generis zone, the 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ), but within which the coastal state would have a virtual monopoly on the right to allocate resources. How this was done is analyzed using a model that shows the progress over time on major issues of the parliamentary-​diplomatic-​style negotiation in which consensus was required for an acceptable outcome. The shifting positions of major states and bargaining groups as they maneuvered toward consensus is examined on the questions of the creation of the 200-mile EEZ, the rights 9of foreign fishermen in the EEZ, the fishing rights of geographically disadvantaged states in the EEZ, and the management of highly migratory species. Analysis shows that the new ocean regime, created through complex tradeoffs and strenuous issue-by-issue bargaining, was critically influenced by fisheries issues."
