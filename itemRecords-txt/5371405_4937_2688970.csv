10,Abstract:,"The enzyme was purified 120-fold; characterizatio​n includes molecular weight, isoelectric point, substrate specificity, enzyme kinetics, chromatographic behavior, and sensitivity to inhibitors. The physical and catalytic properties of the tuna enzyme are compared to those of bovine and blue-white dolphin metmyoglobin reductase."
