14,Abstract:,"The San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta together comprise the largest estuary in the western United States; the estuary covers approximately 1600 square miles and drains over 40% of the state. One of the most important species of economic and ecological value residing in the Delta is the striped bass, ""Morone saxatilis"", introduced in the late 1800s. Since the mid-1970s the striped bass population has experienced an alarming decline, and larval recruitment has been extremely low. In this report, the chemical contaminants present in the livers of moribund and healthy striped bass were examined and compared with those occurring in the livers of adult fish caught in the Pacific Ocean. The types of contaminant encountered suggested that industrial, agricultural, and urban pollutants were present in the livers of moribund fish."
