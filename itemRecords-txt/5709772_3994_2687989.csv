11,Abstract:,"Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism of bacterial small-subunit (SSU) rRNA sequences represents a potential means for characterizing complex bacterial populations such as those found in natural environments. In order to estimate the resolution potential of this approach, the authors examined the SSU rRNA sequences in the Ribosomal Project bank using a computer algorithm which simulates hybridization between DNA sequences. Their analysis indicates that length variation in terminal restriction fragments of PCR products from the SSU rRNA sequences can identify a wide spectrum of bacteria."
