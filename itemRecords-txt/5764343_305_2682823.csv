11,Abstract:,"The red sea urchin (""Strongylocentâ€‹rotus franciscanus"") has drawn considerable attention in the ecological and fisheries literature due to its proposed role as a keystone species and the great monetary value of the fishery. Since 1988, however, catch and catch per unit effort (CPUE) have steadily declined in northern California and there is now a concern that the population has been harvested to near the point of recruitment failure. Following rapid growth of the fishery in northern California there is now concern over its long-term viability. Catch per unit effort has declined, and fishery independent surveys have shown a substantial decrease in densities. Using a maximum likelihood procedure incorporating size distributions and growth increments based on the von Foerster equation, the authors have examined along-shore spatial variation in growth, natural mortality, harvest mortality and recruitment of the red sea urchin."
