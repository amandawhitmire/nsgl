15,Abstract:,"Fisheries management, including the development of fishery management plans (FMPs), requires the bestavailable scientific information. To address this need, we piloted a collaborative at-sea sampling program (CASP)among California commercial lobster fishermen, scientists, and fishery managers to develop scientifically rigorousprotoco​ls and collect, analyze, and interpret essential fisheries information (EFI). Significant differences in catchcharacteri​stics among three regions (South, North Coast, and Northwest Islands) were documented. Legal CPUEwas generally similar among regions, whereas sublegal CPUE was consistently highest in the South, followed by theNorth Coast and Northwest Islands. Evaluation of size structure revealed that legal lobsters were significantlysm​aller, just larger than legal size, in the South than in the other two regions, suggesting a higher exploitation ratethere. Despite this, the South had significantly more prerecruits than the northern regions, a fact not considered inpresent fishery models. We also found a female bias in the legal sex ratios in the north regions and in the sublegalsex ratios in all regions that could affect model parameters for trap vulnerability and reproductive capacity.A discrepancy in the average weight of legal lobster for the Northwest Islands was identified which has implicationsfor the spawning potential ratio, a reference point that elicits management action. The regional variations in catchcharacteri​stics suggest that the California lobster fishery would benefit from using more sophisticated models thatincorporate area-based EFI to better inform the harvest control rules. This finding supports the recommendations​of the lobster FMP scientific review panel and the interests of resource managers, with the CASP data illustratingthe value of the additional EFI and a mechanism for obtaining it. The demonstrated utility of the CASP for bothcross-​checking and providing additional data supports its ongoing use to inform management of the lobster fisheryand as a model for other fisheries."
