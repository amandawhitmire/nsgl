11,Abstract:,"In this paper the structures of four new tricyclic diterpene pentosides, pseudopterosins A-D, isolated from the sea whip, ""Pseudopterogor​gia elisabethae"", are reported. The pseudopterosins represent a new structural class of antiinflammator​y and analgesic metabolites. The pseudopterosins show potencies at least equivalent to that of the antiinflammator​y drug indomethacin and appear to possess unique, but not yet fully defined, pharmacological mechanisms of action. As analgesics, the pseudopterosins show potencies equal to or greater than indomethacin."
