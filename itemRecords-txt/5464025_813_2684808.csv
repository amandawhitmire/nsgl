9,Abstract:,"The bat ray, ""Myliobatis californica"", is the only California member of the family Myliobatidae. It is a common inhabitant of shallow inshore waters and estuaries, and ranges from Oregon to the Gulf of California. The reproductive patterns of the bat ray are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to determine the size and age at reproductive maturity for male and female bat rays and to characterize aspects of their reproductive cycle off central California."
