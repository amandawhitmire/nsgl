10,Abstract:,"The objective of this project was to develop an analytical tool for computing the behavior and conditions of waterfront sheet pile walls during and right after earthquake ground shaking. Key factors for the judgement of seismic performance of waterfront anchor bulkheads are bending moment in the wall and permanent lateral movement induced by earthquake shaking; those are affected mainly by elastic and inelastic soil behavior, excess porewater pressure, wall flexibility, motions of backfill and wall, and hydrodynamic pressure both front and back of the wall. The finite element method, a convenient analytical technique to consider rationally all of those important factors, was adapted to this project."
