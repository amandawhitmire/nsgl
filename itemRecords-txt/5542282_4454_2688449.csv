9,Abstract:,"The relationship between host and symbiont is often difficult to assess and quantify. A novel technique that may help assess the host/symbiont relationship of organisms found in crab egg masses is described; it may have application in determining the relationship of other host/symbiont associations. Crab eggs were killed cryogenically and exposed in combinations with live eggs to a previously unreported symbiont of crab egg masses. Results indicated that the chytrid ""Rhizophydium littoreum"" is primarily a saprobe that attacks dead eggs; yet at high zoospore densities, it attacks and kills live eggs. Furthermore, ""R. littoreum"" is the first chytridiomycete to be reported from a marine crustacean host. It was highly prevalent on the eggs of its host and was found throughout the year."
