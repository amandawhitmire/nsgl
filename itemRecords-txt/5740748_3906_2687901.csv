11,Abstract:,Rainbow trout subjected to an acute stressor twice daily for the first month after hatching subsequently showed a reduced cortisol response to stress at 10.5 and 25 weeks of age compared to control fish which had not been handled. The authors conclude that (1) larval handling can alter subsequent stress responsiveness in trout; (2) the effects of handling may be mediated by stress-induced increases in cortisol and/or thyroid hormone; and (3) it may be possible to use simple environmental treatments during larval development to produce trout with physiological and/or behavioral traits that would make them superior performers for intensive aquaculture or for stocking the natural environment.
