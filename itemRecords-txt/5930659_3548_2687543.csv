13,Abstract:,"Rainfall during winter storms produces extensive, turbid freshwater plumes in the coastal waters of the Southern California Bight. When the plumes result from urban runoff they contain toxic pollutants along with pathogenic bacteria and viruses, often resulting in closure of public beaches. For this study, researchers examined the spatial structure and evolution of stormwater plumes in Santa Monica Bay in 1996. They mainly focused on the spatial distributions of temperature, salinity, and density of the plumes and surrounding waters."
