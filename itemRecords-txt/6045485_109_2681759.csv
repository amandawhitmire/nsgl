11,Abstract:,"This 32-page book analyzes the 23-year spawning escapement study (1980-2002) of the fall chinook salmon run on the West Branch Mill Creek, a tributary of the Smith River in Northern California. This is the longest known time-series study of native salmon in California. The Smith River is the largest un-dammed, free-flowing river in California, draining into the Pacific Ocean. It is considered the healthiest river system in California and has ""Wild and Scenic River"" status, is part of a National Recreation Area, and is managed by the California State Parks/Redwood National Park systems. The purpose of the study was to estimate the relative abundance of spawning fall chinook in a defined study section over a period of more than 20 years as habitat changed. An age composition of the spawning population was also determined."
