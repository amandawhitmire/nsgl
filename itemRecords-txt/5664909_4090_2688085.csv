11,Abstract:,"Recent press reports of foodborne illness have underscored the need for comprehensive and effective systems for ensuring food safety. The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system provides food processors with a systematic approach to identifying and monitoring possible sources of microbiologicalâ€‹, chemical, and physical contamination. Regulators and industry officials view the HACCP program as an effective way to control potential safety hazards. This booklet first introduces the HACCP concept and then describes the preparation of seafood salad as an example of how to apply the seven HACCP steps. The publication also includes flow charts and critical control points for selected deli foods, a list of available training materials, and a bibliography."
