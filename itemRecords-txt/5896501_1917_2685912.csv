15,Abstract:,"Recently, commercial aquaculture farms in northern California have exposed gravid, cultured white sturgeon females to cold water throughout the late phase of vitellogenesis and ovarian follicle maturation resulting in improved ovulation rates and egg quality. This study examines the timing of transfer (late fall or early spring) of gravid females from ambient to cold water to oocyte development, the incidence of ovarian regression, and plasma sex steroid concentrations as indicators of ovarian development."
