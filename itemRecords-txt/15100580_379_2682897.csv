14,Abstract:,"The California halibut, Paralichthys californicus (Ayres), is the target of an avid recreational fishery and a nearly US $2 million commercial fishery. It is one of the State of California’s highest priorities for developing a fishery management plan (California Department of Fish and Game 2001). A 2011 stock assessment conservatively found the southern population (from Point Conception, California to the USA-Mexico border) to be depleted to about 14% of its unfished biomass (Maunder et al. 2011). However, this stock assessment lacked the sexspecific data required to be reliable (MacCall et al.2011). Sex-specific data are necessary because of the vastly different life-history parameters for female and male P. californicus. Most notably, females grow faster, are caught more frequently and mature significantly later than males (Maunder et al. 2011). The most robust study on the subject found mature females as small as 36 cm, 50% of individuals mature at 47 cm and 100% mature at 59 cm. In contrast, the same study found mature males as small as 19 cm, 50% of individuals mature at 23 cm and 100% mature at 32 cm (Love & Brooks 1990). The state’s managing authority, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), plans to gather more data over the next several years to address data gaps and deficiencies identified by the stock assessment peer-review panel before pursuing a fishery management plan."
