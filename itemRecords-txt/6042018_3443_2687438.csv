9,Abstract:,"The popularity of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has grown significantly in recent years.There are approximately 300 marine protected areas in the U.S. MPAs should not be confused with ""marine reserves,"" which are just one type of MPA. ""Marine reserves are areas in which no extractive use of any resource - living, fos- sil, or mineral - nor any habitat destruction is allowed."" The categories of MPAs can range from strictly protected wilderness areas to multiple-use areas. In the middle are ""no-take marine reserves"" - areas of the marine environment where fishing, both commercial and recreational, is prohibited by law, but other recreational activities are permitted. The establishment of MPAs, especially marine reserves, is often controversial. There is strong resistance in many sectors to placing restrictions on a traditionally public resource, the ocean. Commercial fishermen fear the loss of income and a way of life. Recreational users, fishermen, divers, and boaters worry about the loss of access.Despite the fact that oceans cover 71 percent of the Earth's surface, only 1 percent of the oceans are set aside as marine protected areas, and only 1 percent of the marine areas under U.S. jurisdiction have been designated. Even when an area is designated an MPA, fishing prohibitions are unlikely. Although 5 percent of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary CNMS) and approximately 10 percent of the Channel Islands N M S in California are designated no-take marine reserves, it is not a common management technique even within the National Marine Sanctuary System. MPAs are designed to achieve a variety of goals generally falling within six categories: conservation of biodiversity and habitat, fishery management, research and education, enhancement of recreation and tourism, maintenance of marine ecosystems, and protection of cultural heritage. MPAs help maintain essential ecological processes and life support systems, preserve genetic diversity, and ensure the sustainable utilization of species and ecosystems. MPAs are often proposed as components of fisheries management to enhance the long-term sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources or rebuild depleted stocks and to protect particularly delicate areas or previously exploited areas. Evidence is mounting that MPAs are an effective management tool to preserve habitat, improve fish stocks, and protect resources. Anecdotal evidence suggest marine reserves have a ""spillover effect"" on surrounding waters, increasing population densities and fish size outside the reserve. Restrictions on trawling protect seabeds and benthic communities. Increasing diversity and restoring habitat can lead to improved visitor experience. Designation of cultural heritage MPAs, such as the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in Lake Huron and Midway National Wildlife Refuge on Midway Atoll, can prevent the removal and damage of historical artifacts. The world's oceans are currently under attack from all sides. Pollution affects water quality and species health, overfishing causes wide-spread economic hardship and ecological damage, and habitat destruction further reduces populations of marine species. A global network of Marine Protected Areas may be humanity's best management option to stem the tide of destruction. The United States took the first step towards such a network in 2000."
