10,Abstract:,"This booklet is a comprehensive overview of anti-fouling strategies for small boat owners. Every boat owner knows that fouling growth, such as algae, barnacles, mussels and worms, can slow sail boats and increase fuel consumption for power boats. Many anti-fouling paints, however, contain copper that ends up contaminating coastal waters. A number of effective alternatives such as frequent hull cleaning and the use of nontoxic bottom coatings (a variety of which are described here in detail) can help reduce pollution. Included is a list of products with manufacturer comments."
