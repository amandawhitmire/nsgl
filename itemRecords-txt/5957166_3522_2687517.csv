11,Abstract:,"Vanadium bromoperoxidase (V-BrPO) is an enzyme present in marine algae that catalyzes electrophilic halogenation reactions using hydrogen peroxide to oxidize and thereby activate bromide ion. In this study, scientists review the structure of vanadium haloperoxidases and show that V-BrPO can catalyze the bromination and cyclization of terpene substrates that are likely biological precursors to halogenated marine natural products of pharmaceutical interest."
