12,Abstract:,"Natural and fishing mortality rates of the red sea urchin (""Strongylocent​rotus franciscanus"") in northern California were estimated from growth increment and size distribution data at three nominally unharvested sites: Bodega Marine Reserve, Caspar Closure, and Salt Point. The authors then used the estimates to calculate fishing mortality rate estimates for individuals greater than the minimum legal size using size distribution data from 11 harvested sites. They interpret these results with regard to recruitment dynamics and management of the fishery."
