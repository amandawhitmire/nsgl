10,Abstract:,"Frozen storage of fish is an effective means of preservation which prevents or decreases undesirable chemical changes while maintaining many characteristics of fresh fish. However, during long-term storage, fish and fish products may still deteriorate at a much reduced rate. Edible, protective film coatings can lessen or prevent quality changes and prolong storage life in foods such as frozen fish by acting as barriers to control moisture transfer, oxygen uptake and loss of volatile aromas and flavors. Whey protein isolate and acetylated monoglyceride coatings were evaluated for effectiveness against moisture loss and lipid oxidation of frozen King salmon. A model gel material was also used to screen coatings for effectiveness against moisture loss."
