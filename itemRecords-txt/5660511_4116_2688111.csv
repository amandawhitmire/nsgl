12,Abstract:,"Dihydrohalichon​dramide is a trisoxazole-​containing metabolite of the sponge ""Halichondria"" sp. that is concentrated by the nudibranch ""Hexabranchus sanguineus"" for use as a chemical deterrent against predation. In this study, metal binding to the oxazole portion of dihydrohalichon​dramide (1), trisoxazole (2), and diphenyloxazole (3) are studied by fluorescence quenching and nmr techniques. The trisoxazole conformation is modeled by semiempirical computations. 1-3 are found to be relatively weak binders which do not exhibit a significant chelate effect. The biological action of 1 is not related to metal binding."
