9,Abstract:,"An interesting phenomenon of our times has been the negotiation of a number of multilateral natural resource regimes. Not only has the negotiations process been fascinating to both analysts and `stakeholders' alike, but, most importantly, we are now beginning to see the next phase of the process-​-​implementation. This article concerns the role that one stakeholder, Japan, has played in the development and early phases of implementation of three natural resource regimes in the Antarctic region--the Antarctic Treaty System, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and the newly completed Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities. The authors discuss the perspectives, interests, and concerns that Japan brought to the negotiations in order to gain an understanding of the role Japan has played in the formation and implementation of the Antarctic regime. Some of the dilemmas of Japanese foreign policy in general, and resource policy in particular, are examined, and some insight into the nature of negotiated resource regimes is provided."
