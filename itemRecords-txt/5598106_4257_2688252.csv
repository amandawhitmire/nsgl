10,Abstract:,"Analyses of post-mortem accident studies lead to a greater understanding of the effects of human and organizational error (HOE) in accident sequences. This report establishes a methodology for formulating qualitative and quantitative models to identify and correlate the impacts of human factors on marine casualties. In addition, the model developments assist engineers, operators, and regulators in determining HOE management alternatives in developing future operating policy and procedures. The models are used as a framework to construct general models for two classes of marine accidents: tanker groundings and process leaks during simultaneous production and maintenance on platforms. Examples for evaluating recommendations and newly developed operating procedures are evaluated for both models."
