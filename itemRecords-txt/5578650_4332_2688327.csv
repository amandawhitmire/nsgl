10,Abstract:,"Ecdysteroids (Ecds) are polyhydroxylateâ€‹d steroid hormones found in arthropods. In crustaceans, Ecds are known to be important in the regulation of molting and may have other roles in reproduction. This study extends earlier observations on the distribution and metabolism of Ecds in lobsters. Titers of Ecd metabolites in midgut glands (MGs) are reported for lobsters at four molt stages. Evidence for apolar Ecd association with a putative binding protein in the lobster that is similar to one previously described in the crayfish is reported."
