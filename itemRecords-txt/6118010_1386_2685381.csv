11,Abstract:,"Scorpaenopsis eschmeyeri, formerly tentatively identified as S. possi, is described as new from 17 specimens from Fiji, Chesterfield Islands in the Coral Sea, New Caledonia, and the southern Great Barrier Reef. It is separated from S. possi by the lack of the pretympanic spine that is unique to S. possi, by its smaller size (largest specimen, 142 mm SL, compared to 194 mm for S. possi), and by a longer head, snout, upper jaw, and predorsal length, compared to specimens of possi of the same size range. Scorpaena lacrimatus is described from a single specimen, 198 mm SL, taken in 400 m off Tahiti, Society Islands. It is distinct from other species of the genus by the combination of the following characters: deep body (depth 2.5 in SL), 17 pectoral rays, and 61 scales in longitudinal series. Scorpionfishes, aptly named for their venomous fin spines, are not well represented at islands of the South Pacific, compared to the rest of the Pacific. Only 60 species of scorpaenids are known from the South Pacific from Lord Howe Island and New Caledonia to Easter Island (Solomon Islands and Vanuatu not included). By contrast, Poss in Carpenter and Niem (1999) listed 131 scorpaenids (12 with a question mark) for the central and western Pacific (Hawaiian Islands not included). The Indo-Pacific scorpionfish genus Scorpaenopsis was revised by Randall and Eschmeyer (2001); 24 species were recognized, of which eight were described as new. One of these, the wideranging S. possi, included ten specimens from the southwest Pacific from Fiji to the southern Great Barrier Reef that lack the characteristic small spine (called the pretympanic spine) dorsally on the head before the tympanic spine. No typical S. possi were found at any of these localities. These ten specimens were not listed as paratypes of S. possi. Recent collections of shore fishes in Fiji by the authors and associates resulted in 12 additional specimens of the same form. Our study of these specimens, plus seven of the nontype ""possi"" (one CAS lot of three specimens from the Great Barrier Reef has been lost) has enabled us to determine that they represent a new species. The Bishop Museum received a specimen of Scorpaena from Tahiti, caught at the unusual depth of 400 m. Four species of Scorpaena are reported from South Pacific islands of Oceania west to Australia: S. thomsoni Gunther from Juan Fernandez Island, S. orgila Eschmeyer and Allen from Easter Island, S. cookii G�nther from the Kermadec Islands to New South Wales, and S. cardinalis Richardson and S. papillosa (Forster) from New Zealand and southeastern Australia. In addition, S. thomsoni Gunther was described from Juan Fernandez Island in the eastern Pacific. Comparison of the Tahitian specimen with these species, as well as others from the Indo-Pacific region, revealed that it represents an undescribed species. The objective of the present paper is the description of these two new scorpionfishes."
