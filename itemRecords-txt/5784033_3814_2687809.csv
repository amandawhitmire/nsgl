This paper examines diverse attitudes toward animals and how such attitudes are formed and affected by cultural belief systems, environmental constraints, scale of development, and cross-cultural influences, in an effort to resolve cross-cultural conflict issues and create ways to mitigate environmental impacts resulting from culturally based practices."
