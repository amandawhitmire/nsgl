15,Abstract:,"Growth performance in vertebrates is regulated by environmental factors including the quality and quantity offood, which influence growth via endocrine pathways such as the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-​like growthfactor somatotropic axis. In several teleost fishes, circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1)correlate positively with growth rate, and it has been proposed that plasma Igf1 levels may serve as an indicatorof growth variation for fisheries and aquaculture applications. This study tested whether plasma Igf1 concentrationsm​ight serve as an indicator of somatic growth in olive rockfish (Sebastes serranoides), one speciesamong dozens of rockfishes important to commercial and recreational fisheries in the Northern Pacific Ocean.Juvenile olive rockfish were reared under food ration treatments of 1% or 4% wet mass per d for 98 d toexperimentall​y generate variation in growth. Juvenile rockfish in the 4% ration grew 60% more quickly in massand 22% faster in length than fish in the 1% ration. Plasma Igf1 levels were elevated in rockfish under the 4%ration, and individual Igf1 levels correlated positively with growth rate, as well as with individual variation inhepatic igf1 mRNA levels. Transcripts encoding the Igf binding proteins (Igfbps) igfbp1a and igfbp1b were also athigher abundance in the liver of rockfish in the 1% ration treatment, while mRNAs for igfbp5a and igfbp5b wereelevated in the skeletal muscle of 4% ration fish. These findings support the use of plasma Igf1 as a physiologicalin​dex of growth rate variation in rockfish."
