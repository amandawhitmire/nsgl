16,Abstract:,"The Aleutian Islands extend over 2,000 km westward from Unimak Island to Attu Island, covering some of the most biologically diverse marine ecosystems in the world. The Aleutian Islands consists of volcanic oceanic islands delineating the North Pacific Ocean from the Bering Sea. Sub-littoral zones mainly consist of rocky substrates that are covered by encrusting coralline alga and a variety of kelps. Fine-grain sediments occur sporadically. Alaska Monitoring and Assessment Program coastal surveys are based on the Environmental Protection Agency, National Coastal Assessment (NCA) procedures using a probabilistic sampling design featuring monitoring of select environmental indicators. Data are integrated from multiple media, including data on water quality, sediment, biological, physical and chemical parameters to assess ecosystem conditions. Traditional NCA uses a multi-tiered sediment triad approach focused on fine-grain sediments, but cannot characterize the status of this region's rocky benthic ecological resource. As a result dive transect and quadrat methods were developed to collect benthic data for rocky and sedimentary benthic habitats of the nearshore Aleutian Islands in 2006 and 2007. This paper focuses on new sampling methodology implemented by scuba divers on hard substrates around the Aleutian Islands."
