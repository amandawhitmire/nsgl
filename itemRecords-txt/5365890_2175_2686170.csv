8,Abstract:,"Oceanology is multidisciplina​ry, encompassing biology, geology, paleontology, chemistry, physics, meteorology, law, and economics. Despite the recent emphasis on outer space exploration, the exploration of inner space--the World Ocean--has a longer history and holds more immediate promise. This teacher's guide (Unit III, covering research) is designed to stimulate student interest and discusses the history of sea exploration, current issues from the serious (continental drift) to the whimsical (existence of sea monsters), and the tools of an oceanologist. The guide is designed for grades K-6 and is in English and Spanish."
