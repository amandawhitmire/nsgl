14,Abstract:,"Traditional elliptic harbor wave models are based on the assumptions that the region outside the computational grid is of constant depth and that the exterior coastlines are collinear and fully reflecting. These assumptions, which generally are not met in practice, can lead to unreliable simulations even with sophisticated modern wave models. The authors of this paper developed a technique to overcome these limitations based on a one-dimensional representation to better simulate the effects of the exterior bathymetry. The results are then interfaced along the open boundary of a two-dimensional finite-element harbor wave model. The new model is tested against analytical solutions for the case of wave propagation on a sloping beach, a difficult problem for harbor models in use today."
