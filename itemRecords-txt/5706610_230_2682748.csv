12,Abstract:,"Restoration of estuarine wetlands is a high priority in many regions of the Pacific Coast because so little of these habitats still remain. But Pacific Coast problems and needs are not easily satisfied by policies for resource management that may work in the 'textbook estuaries' of the East Coast, or elsewhere. In this update of findings and scientific perspective from a southern California research program, Dr. Joy B. Zedler and contributors, review several efforts toward wetland restoration from British Columbia to the Mexican border, with emphasis on work in San Diego County. On the basis of these experiences, they describe some of the problems that constrain restoration and recommend ways to improve planning and accelerate the development of ecosystems. They then offer suggestions for improving the assessment of restoration sites, including recent applications of high-resolution remote sensing, and conclude with recommendations for managing restoration sites adaptively."
