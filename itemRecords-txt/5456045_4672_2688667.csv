10,Abstract:,"Monoclonal antibodies were produced to kappa carrageenan, a gelling phycocolloid from red algae. Mouse sera were screened for antibody production; antibodies were screened by enzyme immunoassay and selected by immunofluoresceâ€‹nce. The specificities of eight antibodies were studied with inhibition of enzyme immunoassay by kappa, iota and lambda carrageenans. One antibody was quite specific for kappa carrageenan, one antibody reacted least with kappa carrageenan and several antibodies preferred either kappa or iota types of gelling carrageenan to the highly sulfated, non-gelling lambda carrageenan. Applications of these antibodies include analysis of carrageenan composition, cell wall studies and algal and protoplast strain selection for improved gel quality."
