10,Abstract:,"Both the amino acid proline and the disaccharide trehalose effectively preserve frozen or dehydrated biological membranes or liposomes to varying degree, despite their different chemical properties. Here the nature of the interaction between these molecules and phospholipids and the physical basis for their effects on phospholipids are studied with particular focus on the interaction between these compounds with phospholipids in bulk solution."
