10,Abstract:,"Reciprocal diet switches were conducted with first-feeding white sturgeons ""Acipenser transmontanus"" to investigate possible mechanisms of food acceptance and food preferences. Survival and relative growth rates were significantly reduced following a switch from a more natural diet (chopped ""Tubifex"" sp. worms) to a prepared diet (Biodiet), whereas growth was improved, and survival was improved or unaffected, following the reciprocal diet switch. Strong or exclusive preferences for ""Tubifex"" can develop quickly. Data suggest that the animals are more `prepared' physiologically and anatomically to accept and assimilate the more natural diet during the early life stages."
