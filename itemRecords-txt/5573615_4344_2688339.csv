10,Abstract:,"Acoustic system design normally requires a transducer to possess a specific radiation pattern. Yet simplicity of hardware is, as always, an overriding design criterion. One way to minimize hardware is to approximate the required amplitude distribution in the transducer with a small number of constant amplitude segments. The problem then becomes one of optimally choosing the sizes of the segments and their amplitudes. This paper describes the optimum mean square quantizer approach as an optimal way to approximate a continuous amplitude distribution using a small number of constant amplitude segments. The analysis applies to a stave transducer producing a 1-dimensional beam."
