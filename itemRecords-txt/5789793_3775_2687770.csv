10,Abstract:,"The modern movement for 'ocean enclosure' through the extension of coastal jurisdiction beyond the old three-mile line was set in motion sixty years ago by Stefan Riesenfeld and others. The type of entry limitation that was advocated by Riesenfeld, at least as an interim measure to protect fisheries from depletion has become legitimated through the UN Law of the Sea Convention and the nearly universal acceptance of the 200-mile limit by the world's coastal states. In regard to domestic fishery management, whether jurisdiction by coastal states within their own Exclusive Economic Zones, by limiting entry through privatization, use of ITQs, or some other means, will be capable of reversing the tragic decline in the stocks of the world's marine fishery resources, is problematical."
