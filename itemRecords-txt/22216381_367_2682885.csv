8,Abstract:,"Management and restoration of wetlands must occur with both an understanding of the past and a prediction of the future. When you need to contemplate something important, you walk along the beach, or spend a weekend in the mountains, or a week in the desert. You don’t tell your family and friends that you are going for a stroll in the marsh or a weekend in the slough. You don’t clear your mind in the floodplain. Wetlands clearly do not have the obvious majesty or romanticism of many of Southern California’s other natural habitats; however, wetlands are one of the most important habitats in Southern California, affecting everything from water quality to flood control, to the health of fish and the ecosystem as a whole. USC Sea Grant has a long history of funding research on Southern California’s wetlands. Research from the past focused primarily on the historical ecology of wetlands—their composition and distribution before anthropogenic disturbance, as well as how they changed or were lost up to the present day. Current research often focuses on developing restoration plans that are appropriate in the face of a quickly changing climate and a highly urbanized coastline. Let’s revisit some of the highlights of USC Sea Grant’s wetland research over the last decade as well as new research that is shaping the future of wetlands, and perhaps we can convince you to take your next stroll…in the lowlands."
