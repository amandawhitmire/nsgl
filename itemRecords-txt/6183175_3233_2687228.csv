14,Abstract:,"It is estimated that the global load of nitrate and ammonia carried by rivers doubled and that of dissolved phosphate tripled from the 1970s to the 1990s as human population increased by more than 1.6 billion. Not only did nutrient loads increase, but a suite of man-made toxins also infiltrated the environment and will eventually be transported to the coastal zone. It is conceivable that these chemical loadings will affect semi-enclosed marine systems (SEMSs) most strongly. In this chapter, we provide estimates of the loads of nutrients (N and P) and two hazardous man-made chemicals-â€‹polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)-carried by rivers into thirteen SEMSs (Plate 5; Table 8-1) and assess the potential impacts of these loadings on coastal environments."
