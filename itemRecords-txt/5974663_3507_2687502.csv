10,Abstract:,"Two key issues that need to be addressed in the planning of marine reserves are: (1) how the design of reserves will affect sustainability of populations in a system of marine reserves, and (2) how yield will change in affected fisheries. To date, both of these have been addressed in only a qualitative fashion. In the first part of this document, the authors summarize evolving modeling results regarding sustainability and yield. In the second part, they present new simulation results that demonstrate how sustainability and yield interact in an example of marine reserves in a typical size-â€‹structured, fished population distributed over space."
