8,Abstract:,"Freshwater-​acclimated fish gradually exposed to seawater had higher plasma osmolalities than did the bay water-​acclimated fish. Young adult sturgeon are able to tolerate transfer from fresh- to seawater as well as gradual transfer from seawater to fresh water. Plasma electrolytes in transferred fish are regulated, but tend to differ from long term acclimated fish at the same salinities. There is a gradual increase in the upper salinity tolerance (abrupt transfer) of juvenile white sturgeon with weight; the ability of juveniles to regulate plasma osmolality is limited. Young adult fish are able to tolerate higher salinities (35 ppt) than juveniles but probably are also characterized by low activity of the necessary ion exchange mechanisms in the gills which permit rapid adjustment of blood electrolytes with change in external salinity."
