8,Abstract:,"Vastly expanded scientific knowledge of the oceans, including an enhanced understanding of living marine resources, has intersected with market forces generated by rising world demand for protein, with far-reaching innovations in fishing and fish-processing technology, and also with aggressive expansion of distant-water fishing by large- scale vessels around the globe. The combination of these forces has placed enormous pressure on ocean fishery resources. In the field of international relations and law, this pressure on fisheries has given impetus to the movement for `enclosure' of ocean waters which has culminated in the legitimation by the U.N. Law of the Sea Convention of Exclusive Economic Zones of 200 miles' distance offshore. This article is a study of several elements of the development of marine science, ocean policy, and international law. Its framework is provided by the career and contributions of biologist Wilbert McLeod Chapman (1910-1970), a figure whose efforts both reflected and actively shaped many of the principal developments in American ocean science and policy as well as international fisheries law from the end of World War II to 1970."
