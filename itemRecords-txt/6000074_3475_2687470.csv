18,Abstract:,"Spatial surveys of nearshore bathymetry and associated velocity fields are essential for many nearshore investigations. A hydrographic surveying system has been designed and tested to acquire nearshore beach profile data. Traditional vessel-mounted echosounder surveying instrumentation was placed in watertight containers and configured for a personal watercraft (PWC) for measurements of subaqueous nearshore beach profiles. With the existence of the hydrographic surveying system, an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) was configured onto a PWC to measure nearshore currents. The system is able to withstand the harsh environment of the nearshore and acquire both beach profile information and currents across the surf zone. The system was tested in Sand City, CA during the RIPEX field experiment. The depth-averaged mean cross-shore velocities of the PWC were on the same order of magnitude as fixed instruments, but with a significantly large error (approximately 20 cm/s). This paper describes the system and results of measurements obtaining nearshore current measurements in rip channels."
