12,Abstract:,"During spring and summer 1993, the authors monitored settlement of crabs (primarily ""Cancer"" spp.) and sea urchins ""Strongylocentr​otus"" spp. in conjunction with physical variables associated with coastal circulation to investigate how physical conditions influence the spatial distribution of recruitment along the coast. Observations were made along a 100 km stretch of the northern California coast from the Gulf of the Farallones north to Point Arena. Results suggest that crabs were transported northward alongshore in the thermal front which propagated northward during each relaxation event. This alongshore transport mechanism may be responsible for the predictable pattern of settlement variability within the system: with continuous, event-modulated settlement south of Point Reyes and episodic, event-dependent settlement to the north. Similar physical/biolog​ical interactions may occur at other points along this coast and along the midlatitude boundaries of other oceans."
