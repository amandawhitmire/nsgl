11,Abstract:,"Grazing by microzooplankto​n such as rotifers, tintinnids, and heterotrophic dinoflagellates is believed to contribute to the decline of red tide blooms. Historical evidence from the coastal waters of southern California reveals that the heterotrophic dinoflagellate genus ""Protoperidiniu​m"" may be very abundant during red tide blooms. Although most ""Protoperidiniu​m"" species are known to feed on diatoms and bacteria, several species have been observed feeding on dinoflagellates​. This study is the first report on the growth and grazing rates, and prey selection, of ""P"". cf. ""divergens"" and ""P. crassipes"" feeding on cultures of local red tide dinoflagellates​, mainly ""Gonyaulax polyedra"", ""Gymnodinium sanguineum"" and ""Scrippsiella trochoidea""."
