9,Abstract:,"An investigation of sponges within the order Dendroceratida was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the absence of siliceous spicules which is characteristic of this order may be compensated by an increase in the variety and quantity of secondary metabolites produced by the animals. The purple dendroceratid sponge ""Aplysilla polyrhaphis"" was collected in a mangrove lagoon on Isla San Jose in the Gulf of California. This extremely fragile, leafy sponge was not overgrown by other invertebrates or algae in this highly diverse and productive environment. Nine diterpenes of the spongian class were isolated; three inhibit feeding by the rainbow wrasse and some of the diterpenes also exhibit antimicrobial activity."
