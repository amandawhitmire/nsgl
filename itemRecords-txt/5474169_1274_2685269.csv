8,Abstract:,"In the fall of 1980 a salmon spawning escapement study was started on the West Branch Mill Creek, a major fall chinook salmon (""Oncorhynchus tshawytscha"") spawning tributary of the Smith River, Del Norte County, California. This report analyzes the data collected during the past eight salmon spawning seasons. The intent of the study was to monitor the population over a ten-year period. However, the recent development of a large California state correctional facility in Del Norte County has necessitated an extension. Pelican Bay Prison will be discharging sewage effluent into holding ponds in the Smith River flood plain. The effects that the tertiary treated wastewater will have on anadromous fish in the Smith River system are not known; in light of this development, the study will continue for another 10-year period."
