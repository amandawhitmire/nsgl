16,Abstract:,"The second Sea Grant Workshop in a two-part series, titled Offshore Aquaculture in the Southern California Bight, was convened to bring together federal and state coastal managers with statutory authorities for review and permitting of marine aquaculture in federal waters off the coast of Southern California with scientists and other stakeholders. This facilitated presentations and discussion to address how to build regulatory confidence in understanding and applying best available science and incorporating appropriate tools that can inform decision-​making. Models were presented as a potential tool to aid in making sound regulatory decisions. Modeling results from the Rose Canyon Fisheries finfish aquaculture project were presented as a case study. The workshop was attended by 31 individuals who represented a cross-section of scientists, regulators, and industry practitioners with proven expertise in the fields of aquaculture and environmental science. State and federal agencies with regulatory responsibilitie​s for permitting aquaculture participated; most agencies were represented. On day one, workshop participants, with the guidance of a professional facilitator, discussed issues and concerns and learned more about the latest science and tools available to inform the permitting process. Participation in day two included primarily the federal and state coastal management agencies with regulatory responsibilitie​s in permitting marine aquaculture. These coastal managers discussed the need to collaborate and potential solutions to improve the environmental review and permit decision-​making process. Some points of discussion included: if and how the science and tools presented at the first workshop and from day one better inform decision-​making; the role of stakeholder input and how to incorporate it; and identifying outstanding concerns and data gaps and next steps."
