11,Abstract:,"Stypoldione is a marine natural product secreted by the brown alga ""Stypopodium zonale"" that inhibits cell division in marine embryos and in mammalian cell cultures. The mechanism responsible for the ability of the compound to inhibit cell division is not known. The compound was found in early studies to inhibit polymerization of tubulin into microtubules in-vitro, which lead to the suggestion that inhibition of microtubule polymerization in cells might be responsible for the ability of the compound to inhibit cell division. Results reported here indicate that at the lowest effective concentrations, stypoldione selectively inhibits cytokinesis while exerting no discernible effect on the organization or function of microtubules. Data are consistent with the idea that although stypoldione is sulfhydryl reactive and thus would be expected to affect many cellular targets, an especially sensitive target exists whose function is critical to cytokinesis."
