10,Abstract:,"The two types of naturally occurring vanadium-​containing proteins that have been identified to date are the vanadium haloperoxidases and vanadium nitrogenase. Haloperoxidases are enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of a halide (i.e., chloride, bromide or iodide) by hydrogen peroxide, a process which can result in the concomitant halogenation of organic substrates or the production of hypochlorous acid depending on the daloperoxidase. This chapter discusses the vanadium haloperoxidases​, vanadium bromoperoxidase​s and vanadium chloroperoxidas​e."
