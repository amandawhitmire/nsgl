10,Abstract:,"Anhydrobiotic nematodes, ""Aphelenchus avenae"", were shown to survive freezing, provided their water content was low. Thermal analysis and measurement of ice content by calorimetry suggested that ice formation did not occur in worms containing less than about 0.3 g water per g dry weight; such worms, when thawed, showed no significant leakage of ions. The conclusion drawn is that bulk, freezable water does not exist in worms containing 0.3 g/g."
