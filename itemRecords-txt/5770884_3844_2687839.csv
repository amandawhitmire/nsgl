13,Abstract:,"In this study, five new cyclic sesquiterpenes, hirsutanols A (6), B (7), C (8), hirsutanol D (9), and ""ent""- gloeosteretriol (10) and a new diketopiperazinâ€‹e (14) were isolated from salt water culture of two fungi. Sesquiterpenes 6-8 and 10 were obtained from an unidentified fungus separated from an Indo-Pacific sponge ""Haliclona"" sp. while 9 and 14 were produced by the terrestrial fungus ""Coriolus consors"" cultured under both sea water and deionized water media. Hirsutanol A (6) and ""ent""- gloesteretriol (10) were found to be anti-microbial (""Bacillus subtilus"") active. All structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods."
