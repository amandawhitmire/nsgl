10,Abstract:,"Marine invertebrates and algae are a rich source of oxidized, often carbocyclic, fatty acid metabolites which have recently become known as 'oxylipins'. The isolation of hybridalactone from the marine red alga ""Laurencia hybrida"" represented the first example of a cyclopropyl and lactone-​containing oxylipin. Recently, however, cyclopropyl- and lactone-​containing eicosanoids have been isolated from a wide variety of unrelated marine organisms. ""Constantinea simplex"" is a small mushroom- shaped red alga which grows attached to low intertidal and subtidal rocks from California to Alaska. Extracts of ""C. simplex"" were found to contain a mixture of ""omega""6 and ""omega""3 unsaturated constanolactone​s, lactonized cyclopropyl-​containing metabolites that logically derive from arachidonic and eicosapentaenoi​c acids, respectively."
