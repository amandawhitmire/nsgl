10,Abstract:,"This study examines the hypothesis that bactivorous microzooplankto​n may directly influence dissolved carbon flux by stimulating release of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Ciliated protozoans and microzooplankto​n were the focus of this study because they can be cultured and collected relatively easily, they are abundant in nearshore planktonic systems, and their trophic role is not well understood. Bactivorous ciliates and microzooplankto​n are shown to contribute quantitatively and qualitatively to the DOM pool in nearshore planktonic systems. DOM released in the presence of bactivores is a readily available carbon source and may thereby influence bacterioplankto​n metabolism and growth activity."
