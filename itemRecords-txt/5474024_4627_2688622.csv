13,Abstract:,"Sponges of the genus ""Luffariella"" have provided a series of sesterterpenes that are potent anti-​inflammatory agents. Both manoalide and seco-manoalide, isolated from the sponge ""Luffariella variabilis,"" are irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2) while luffariellolide is a partially reversible PLA2 inhibitor that was isolated as a major metabolite of a Palauan species of ""Luffariella"". The same specimen of ""Luffariella"" sp. also contained a minor polycyclic sesterterpene, luffolide, that also inhibits hydrolysis of phosphatidylcho​line by bee venom PLA2. That compound is described here."
