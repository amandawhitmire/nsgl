9,Abstract:,"At the mid point of this three-year project, the Sea Grant Faculty and Staff wish to present a summary of progress in the different activities of the Sea Grant Program conducted at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. The environmental data collection and research projects in Monterey Bay have been underway for more than a year, and function efficiently as the routine work is well developed. Emphasis in the collection of environmental data is to provide the decision makers of Monterey Bay communities with the information needed following the suggestions of the Regional Advisory Committee. Chapter two of this report gives details of work in progress in the plankton studies, the hydrographic work, the benthic survey, the productivity of fishes and sand transport in Monterey Bay. The next chapter explains the progress to date in providing additional education in the marine sciences."
