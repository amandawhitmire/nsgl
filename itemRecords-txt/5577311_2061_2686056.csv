15,Abstract:,"A comprehensive, interdisciplinaâ€‹ry study of the interaction of an outfall plume with the coastal ocean was conducted off the coast of Los Angeles. During these observations, the plume modified the local stratification and the effluent was advected by the ambient flow field. This study demonstrates that chemical, biological, and optical variables associated with an outfall plume may be effectively used to study the dispersion of buoyant plumes in the coastal ocean."
