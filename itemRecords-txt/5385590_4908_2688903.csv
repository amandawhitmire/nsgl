9,Abstract:,"The insect developmental regulator, juvenile hormone III, or its presumed precursor, farnesol, were added to water in which larval lobsters (""Homarus americanus"") were allowed to develop. The most reproducible effect observed was a prolonging of the time to metamorphosis; only JH III was effective. Morphological parameters such as carapace, antennae, and chelae lengths were also measured after metamorphosis. JH III generally decreased carapace length, but increased the lengths of the antennae and chelae; such alterations are occasionally also seen with farnesol treatment."
