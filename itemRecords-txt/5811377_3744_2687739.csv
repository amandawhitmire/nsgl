10,Abstract:,"Cited here is the introduction to a supplement based on a special symposium organized on ""Space, time, and scale: new perspectives in fish ecology and management"" held during the 127th annual meeting of the American Fisheries Society in Monterey, California, August 1997. The purpose is to illustrate the breadth and diversity of ideas and applications being explored for integrating space, time, and scaling issues and to highlight future directions. Topics cover a variety of studies, techniques, and applications from salt water to freshwater, from lotic to lentic habitats, and across various scales that can be used as background for integrating space, time, and scale in fish research and management."
