9,Abstract:,"Larvae of the lobster, ""Homarus americanus"", displayed abbreviation of subsequent molt intervals in response to bilateral eyestalk ablation at the 2nd stage; at the 4th stage the ablated larvae were larger than intact controls. Eyestalk removal sometimes resulted in 4th stage larvae with characteristics intermediate between normal 3rd and 4th stages. Eyestalkless larvae that were reared communally and fed frozen ""Artemia"" formed significant numbers of these intermediates, while eyestalkless larvae reared individually and fed live ""Artemia"" nauplii rarely formed intermediates. Results imply that although eyestalks may be involved in the regulation of both the timing and growth increment of larval molting, they may not mediate the morphological aspects of lobster metamorphosis."
