10,Abstract:,"In an effort to design a transducer having low side lobes in the radiation pattern but requiring only a single amplifier, the technique of spatial shading has been explored. This method uses an array of small elements, each driven uniformly, randomly distributed along the transducer with a density distribution that matches the desired shading. All of the elements are driven with the same phase and amplitude. As the individual elements shrink and their packing density increases, the theoretical radiation pattern approaches that of the ideal shading."
