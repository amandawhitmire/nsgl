9,Abstract:,"Review of California's Sea Grant Program, February 1978: A Report to the Secretary of the Resources Agency is a university report prepared in response to the request of the Resources Agency Sea Grant Panel (RASGAP). It is a review of accomplishments of state supported Sea Grant activities. Inasmuch as state funding was initiated in 1974, the review report concentrates on activities from 1974 to 1978; however, activities and projects prior to 1974 are also discussed for greater continuity and comprehension of the programmatic context of research, education, and advisory services. The review report presents a statement of purpose: a summary and recommendationsâ€‹; an overview of the National Sea Grant Program, the California Sea Grant Program, and the Resources Agency Sea Grant Panel; a statement of current funding and estimate of funds required for the immediate future; and a summary of accomplishments and benefits derived from the program. The comprehensive appendices include appropriate program data and information as well as a description of benefits to the state, arranged by geographical region."
