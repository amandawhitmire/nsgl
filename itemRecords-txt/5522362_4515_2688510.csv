13,Abstract:,"Egg activation in the Penaeoidea initiates a series of cortical changes that coincide with the loss of one extracellular matrix (the vitelline envelope) and the formation of three others (the jelly layer, surface coat, and hatching envelope). The time course of these alterations may differ from one genus, or species, to the next, but the events are consistent for all penaeoids studied to date. The jelly layer in penaeoid eggs appears after the onset of egg activation and is formed from a jelly precursor that is housed in extracellular crypts prior to activation. The hatching envelope is elaborated subsequent to jelly layer formation and is the result of the exocytosis of two populations of cortical vesicles that arise in the cortex of the egg after initiation of activation."
