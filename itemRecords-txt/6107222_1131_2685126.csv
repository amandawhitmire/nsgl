10,Abstract:,"Fish caught from piers are an important part of the recreational fishery and are not routinely monitored for phycotoxins. Species taken in this catch are often different from those obtained in the commercial catch further offshore, and diets of pier-caught fish may differ from those of offshore species, resulting in different toxin exposure. Here we report preliminary results from a study on diatom toxins in the recreational fish catch, using data collected from 4 July 2001 to 15 December 2001 at the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf, a heavily fished coastal pier in California. A variety of frequently caught fish species were taken by hook-and-line from the Santa Cruz Wharf and tested for the diatom toxin domoic acid (DA). Fish viscera and muscle tissue were analyzed separately using High Performance Liquid Chromatography methods. DA was detected in fish viscera but not in fish muscle tissue. DA in fish viscera coincided with the appearance of elevated cell counts of species of the DA-producing diatom, Pseudo-​nitzschia australis, and with DA in the water column. DA was detected almost exclusively in white croaker, Genyonemus lineatus, and to a lesser extent in staghorn sculpin, Leptocottus armatus. Although the DA levels in these two fish species were comparatively low (<3 μg/g tissue), the bloom of toxic species was comparatively modest at the time. Given the much higher toxin levels encountered in the region at other times, it is likely that these two species could achieve much larger toxin loads during the more intensive blooms of toxic Pseudo-​nitzschia that occur most years in Monterey Bay. The relationship between toxin levels in the water column and in fish tissue is discussed, as well as the relationship between food habits and the accumulation of domoic acid in white croaker."
