14,Abstract:,"Adociasulfates 1-6 were isolated from an extract of the Palauan sponge ""Haliclona"" (aka ""Adocia"") sp. that inhibited the transport of stabilized microtubules by the motor protein kinesin. Kinesins comprise a superfamily of eukaryotic motor proteins used to transport a large variety of cargoes along microtubule tracks. They are important targets for inhibition because they are involved in many dynamic microtuble- mediated events, including cell division and the transport of vesicles and organelles."
