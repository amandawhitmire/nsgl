12,Abstract:,"PASGAP is a regional organization funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Sea Grant. Its purpose is to identify regional marine needs and priorities and to fill these needs through publications, talent sharing, and workshops. Members include representatives of marine advisory programs at the following universities and agencies: University of Alaska, University of British Columbia, University of California, University of Southern California, University of Hawaii, Oregon State University, University of Washington, and the National Marine Fisheries Service. This directory lists services available to mariners off the California and Hawaii coasts. Services for the North Pacific Coast are listed in the revised Directory of Services for Mariners (PASGAP 1), also available from PASGAP members. This directory duplicates the North Pacific Coast directory in the northern California listings for Crescent City and Eureka. The California listings are given in a north-to-south order along the coast. The Hawaii listings primarily cover the island of Oahu. Most entries are based on information submitted by the firms listed."
