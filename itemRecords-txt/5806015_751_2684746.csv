10,Abstract:,"Environmental attributes (vegetation and sediment properties) and macrofaunal community structure were examined in sediments of five natural, southern California ""Salicornia"" spp. marshes (Tijuana Estuary, San Diego Bay, Mission Bay, Upper Newport Bay and Anaheim Bay) and in created ""Salicornia"" marshes 16 months to 10 years in age, located within four of the bays. The researchers' objectives were to characterize the infaunal assemblages of mature southern California ""Salicornia"" marshes, delineate faunal succession and recovery rates in ""Salicornia"" systems through evaluation of created ""Salicornia"" marshes, examine abiotic and vegetation controls on the marsh macrofaunal assemblages, and compare macrofaunal community structure and successional sequences in ""Salicornia"" and adjacent ""Spartina"" habitats in southern California."
