9,Abstract:,"Because of its unique physical and biological characteristicsâ€‹, Colorado Lagoon (California) was chosen for an investigation of benthic community metabolism as it receives urban impact and supports an introduced macrofaunal species (the bivalve, ""Mercenaria mercenaria"") which is extremely abundant. The objectives of this study were (1) to measure the mean annual rates of benthic aerobic respiration and primary production, the fluxes of ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate between sediment and water in the light and dark, and to relate these contributions of the benthos to the high rates of primary production in overlying waters; (2) to measure the seasonal contribution of the bivalves to rates of total community aerobic respiration and ammonium flux; and (3) to assess spatial and temporal variability of these rates."
