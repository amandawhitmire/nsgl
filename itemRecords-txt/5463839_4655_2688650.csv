9,Abstract:,"Among the wide variety of secondary metabolites that have been isolated from marine sponges, relatively few sulfate esters have been described. During a search for biologically active sponge metabolites, the authors found five sulfated sesterterpene furans and a sulfated sesterterpene hydroquinone in a California sponge of the family Halichondriidae​. This paper reports the structural elucidation of these halisulfates."
