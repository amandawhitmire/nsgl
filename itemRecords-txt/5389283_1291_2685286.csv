8,Abstract:,"A fishery research project conducted on the Smith River, California, in 1983 involved gathering scale samples from adult chinook salmon caught in the Smith River sport fishery. Recent studies conducted on the Smith River have indicated that significant numbers of Klamath River system fall chinook salmon have strayed into the Smith River the last two years. These fish begin to enter the river in late August and continue through mid-October. Of the 613 fish sampled, 559 were of hatchery origin. A breakdown of sex, age, and specific hatchery (where known) is presented."
