10,Abstract:,"This symposium covered a range of topics concerning the coastal marine environment of the Southern California Bight. The objective of this volume is to contribute to an understanding of the problems associated with monitoring and managing this environment, and to suggest ways to improve existing efforts. Topics addressed include contamination trends, the health of fish populations in a large local marina, problems posed by the invasion of exotic plants in coastal wetlands, methods of enhancing coastal fisheries, ways to improve methods of monitoring marine biota, and problems associated with major oil spill clean-up efforts."
