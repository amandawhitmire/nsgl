21,Abstract:,"Coastal vulnerability assessments are increasing in California as a result of state and local government led climate adaptation efforts. Due in part to the proliferation of fine-scale coastal flood models, standardized approaches have been developed for assessing vulnerability of built assets (e.g., roads, infrastructure) based on likelihood of exposure to flooding and potential for adverse consequences to human health and safety. However, habitat changes and lost ecosystem services are more difficult to quantify because (1) ecosystems are dynamic, requiring more sophisticated analyses of projected temporal changes, and (2) there is no consensus on which services should be quantified or what metrics to use. The disparity makes it challenging for decision makers to integrate natural and built assets into coastal adaptation planning. Riskto natural systems can be underrepresente​d, skewing prioritization of vulnerable assets toward the built environment, and failing to adequately account for benefits derived from natural ecosystems (e.g., coastal protection, carbon sequestration, biodiversity support). Working in partnership with the County of San Mateo in the San Francisco Bay (California, USA), we quantified projected changes in tidal marsh habitat and in three metrics of ecosystem services under a high sea level rise scenario, and two sediment availability scenarios. We leveraged existing local models, data, and literature to develop spatially-​explicit maps of projected future changes in tidal marsh bird indicator species abundance, wave attenuation, and above ground carbon stock in 2040, 2070, and 2100, relative to a 2010 baseline. Maps of projected future changes allowed identification of wetlands currently providing high benefits that are projected to remain high under a range of future conditions (i.e., resilient) as well as those providing high benefits now that are likely to be lost (i.e., vulnerable). Changes in habitat drove the delivery of ecosystem services for tidal marsh bird abundance, above ground carbon stock, and wave attenuation benefits. Accordingly, we observed that our tidal wetland-related benefits showed a neutral or positive change by 2040, but were projected to decrease across a large part of the study area by 2070 in response to projected mid-century acceleration in the rate of sea level rise. Wetlands south of the Dumbarton Bridge, which experience higher sediment availability, were projected to be more resilient overall. In partnership with the County of San Mateo and the California Coastal Conservancy, the results are being integrated into coastal adaptation and climate action planning processes at the county-level and in the broader San Francisco Bay region, and disseminated as a case study approach more broadly."
