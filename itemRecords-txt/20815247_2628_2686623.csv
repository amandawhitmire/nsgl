We connect science to local communities to solve our most pressing urban ocean problems. We advance scientific literacy and education among urban residents. We are pleased to share a flyer that highlights our impacts and achievements in 2016. Key work included advancements in coastal hazard resilience, education initiatives, and research applied to solve some of our most pressing urban ocean issues."
