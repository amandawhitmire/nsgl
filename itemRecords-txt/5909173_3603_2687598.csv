12,Abstract:,"This investigation describes the absorption, disposition, biotransformati​on, and elimination of ""p""-nitrophenol (PNP) in red abalone. Absorption and elimination rate constants are determined, as well as the total concentration factor for PNP and its metabolites. Tissue disposition is described, and depurated PNP and metabolic products are identified and quantified."
