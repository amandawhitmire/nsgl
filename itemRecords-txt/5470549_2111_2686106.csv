10,Abstract:,"On the basis of the reported medicinal use of gorgonian corals from the South China Sea, several marine invertebrates, including the abundant white sea whip ""Junceella fragilis"", were collected. The isolation and structure determination of four new diterpenoids, junceellolides A-D, are reported from this latter source. The new compounds possess well-known briarane carbon skeletons and most of the metabolites possess significant anti-​inflammatory properties."
