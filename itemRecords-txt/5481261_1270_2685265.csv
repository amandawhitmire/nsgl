10,Abstract:,"The red abalone, ""Haliotis rufescens"", is the largest member of its genus and historically the most important species in the California abalone fishery. From 1949 to 1970, pink abalones, ""H. corrugata"", supported a fishery equal in importance to the red abalone fishery. After many years of relative stability, the red and pink abalone harvests began a marked decline in the late 1960s. Population dynamics of red abalones were studied 1978-84 on Santa Rosa Island, California. Results were employed in yield-​per-​recruit and egg-per-recruit analyses; similar calculations were made for pink abalones. Analyses suggest that present sport and commercial minimum legal sizes allow for adequate egg production to maintain stock sizes; simple recruitment overfishing is not a satisfactory explanation for the sharp and continuing decline in landings of both species. Other factors are considered and recommendations are made."
