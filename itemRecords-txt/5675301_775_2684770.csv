11,Abstract:,"The most common means of vegetative asexual reproduction among sea anemones are longitudinal fission and pedal laceration. ""Nematostella vectensis"" is one of only 5 sea anemones known to reproduce asexually by transverse fission. Sibling individuals of this species divide at highly variable rates with some individuals dividing rarely or not at all, while others may divide many times a year. Field populations are frequently unisexual, and such populations may be clones derived from a single founder. Multi-crowned anomalies are common in natural and in laboratory populations. Subsequent fission of multi-crowned individuals produces normal, single-crowned anemones and meets the definition of budding, a truly rare phenomenon in sea anemones."
