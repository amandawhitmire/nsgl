9,Abstract:,"The salt marshes of southern California have largely been lost to urbanization. The remnants of natural habitat are continually disturbed, yet they still support rare and endangered species. Efforts to restore intertidal marshes have focused on revegetation with cordgrass (""Spartina foliosa""), but full ecosystem functioning has not yet been demonstrated. In San Diego Bay, an area of high-intertidal marsh that was excavated to create lower-â€‹intertidal marsh lacked functional equivalency with natural wetland remnants at 4-5 years of age. Several comparisons indicated less than 60% functional equivalency with an adjacent reference wetland. Understanding what causes functional inequivalency has led to new methods for improving restoration projects. Research is now underway to test the effectiveness of adding organic matter and nutrients to areas planted with cordgrass, and preliminary results indicate accelerated plant growth rates."
