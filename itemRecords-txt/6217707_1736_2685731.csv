9,Abstract:,"In Mexico, the elasmobranch species composition in commercial fishing catches has been poorly described, especially in the artisanal fishery. Here we analyzed the elasmobranch species composition landed at Laguna Manuela fishing camp, in the west coast of Baja California, which is one of the most active of the region. This work was done taking advantage of the fishermen behavior, that after gutting sharks and rays at the beach, they dump inland the heads of the organism in specific sites called ""waste dumps"". Based on the analysis of the taxonomic characters preserved in discarded heads (teeth and dermal denticles), we identified 25 elasmobranches species and their relative abundance was calculated. In order to analyze how well the species composition at the waste dumps represents the actual catch of the fishery, we characterized the landings species composition at the fishing camp by monthly samplings during the period from March to December 2007. We found a similarity of 84 % between species composition at waste dumps and landings species, but statistical difference were found when proportion of the species were compared (x2= 164.61, p < 0.000). These differences were explained due to the lack of one year cycle in the description of the landings and because at the dumps more than one year of fishing catches have been accumulated. To expand the utility of the heads discarded, we characterized the size structure of the mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) at the waste dumps, using a relationship between the size of the teeth and the total length (TL) of the body (TL= 67.543 * ALI + 454.17). We found that over 80 % of the heads dumped measured between 900-1,800 mm TL, being away from their size at maturity (2,100 and 2,780 mm TL for males and females, respectively). By using this alternative technique to characterize the species composition in the fishery, we know that at Vizcaino Bay has a high diversity of elasmobranchs, which is comparable with other ecologically important areas in Mexico. And that mako shark catches in the region are mainly based on immature sharks."
