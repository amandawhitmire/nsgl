11,Abstract:,"It has been suggested that the mode of action of juvenile hormone (JH) in insects is similar to that of vertebrate steroid hormones. Intracellular JH binding proteins (JHBPs) with the characteristics of the hormone receptors, namely saturability, specificity, and high affinity, have been characterized in insect epidermis. The ""Drosophila"" Kc cell line is a particularly suitable model system for study since the cells are easy to grow in quantities sufficient for JHBP purification, and because there are no endogenous hormones in the cells to dilute the exogenous radiolabeled ligand. In this paper, the photoaffinity labeling technique is employed to document the purification of the JHBP to homogeneity."
