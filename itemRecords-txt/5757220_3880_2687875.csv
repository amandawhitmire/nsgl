13,Abstract:,"This study describes investigations of three potential causes (individually and in conjunction with one another) of withering syndrome in black abalone: (1) water temperature, (2) food availability, and (3) parasites: renal coccidia and rickettsiales-â€‹like procaryotes (RLPs). The authors determined the geographic and host distribution of the coccidian ""P. haliotis,"" in abalone, with a focus on black abalone. In abalone collected from field locations, associations between the intensity of coccidian infection and the condition of the abalone were assessed. In laboratory studies, they examined the relationship between food availability, water temperature, black abalone survival, and intensity of infections by both coccidia and RLPs."
