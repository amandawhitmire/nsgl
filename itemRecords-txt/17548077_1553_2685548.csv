15,Abstract:,"The Pescadero Lagoon Science Panel (PLSP) was established in 2013 to provide independent scientific expertise in support of management decisions and possible restoration actions for Pescadero marsh and lagoon. The PLSP focused on physical and biogeochemical processes in the open-water habitats of lagoon, with attention centered on the annual fish mortality events. Concerns for juvenile steelhead were foremost, but this scientific review also gives attention to other listed species (e.g., tidewater goby) and other major concerns (e.g., winter flooding of low-lying lands). The PLSP report is based on best available science, which goes beyond journal publications to offer the panel’s best professional judgment, derived also from unpublished work, available data and the insights of other scientists that work on Pescadero Lagoon and comparable systems in California and elsewhere. Pescadero Lagoon is located in San Mateo County, 60km south of San Francisco Bay and 40km north of Monterey Bay. It is a bar-built estuary, with a mouth that closes when ocean waves deposit sand in the narrow channel that connects estuary and ocean. The lagoon is surrounded by intertidal marshes, an elevated marsh plain and marshes that form part of the river floodplain. The marsh and lagoon provide habitat for many species, including listed species like steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius ​ newberryi), San Francisco garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia), redlegged frog (Rana draytonii), Western pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata), and Western snowy plover (Charadrius nivosus). In spite of ongoing concerns with quasi-annual fish kills in Pescadero Lagoon, and the volumes of spoken and written comment, there is a paucity of critical data, an absence of strategic monitoring, and a general lack of analysis of key issues that need to be validated and articulated prior to management action. Ultimately the community of stakeholders needs to develop a common set of objectives based on a common vision, which will rest on well-founded scientific understanding of how the system works and the availability of actionable scientific information."
