9,Abstract:,"Whether farmed or wild, salmon are tasty fish and a healthy protein choice. They look and taste nearly the same. Wild Pacific salmon are harvested by fishing, mostly in the north Pacific from June through September. Frozen or canned wild salmon are available outside this period. Farmed Atlantic salmon are hatched, raised and harvested under controlled conditions, and available fresh year-round, usually at lower prices than wild-caught fish."
