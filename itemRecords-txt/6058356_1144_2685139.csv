11,Abstract:,"Marine protected areas (MPAs), and especially marine reserves (or ""no-take zones""), have generated growing interest as an alternative or complement to fishery and broader ocean management. While substantial effort has been directed toward understanding the ecological dimensions, consideration of the human dimensions of MPAs has been limited in content and scope. A growing body of evidence, however, demonstrates the relevance of social scientific data and analyses to MPA processes and outcomes. Social science research done prior to and throughout the MPA process provides information to help insure that the full range of stakeholders is identified, that they understand the issues clearly, and that decisions are made that fit the local context. These, in turn, reduce enforcement costs and increase the integrity of the MPAs so that their ecological and socioeconomic benefits may be realized, while minimizing the costs to individuals and communities. This paper discusses the role of the social sciences in MPAs, with particular attention to marine reserves used for ocean management. We begin with an overview of the social sciences, and briefly discuss the social, cultural, economic and institutional aspects of MPAs. We then discuss the social science research we conducted to inform the Channel Islands marine reserve process. We conclude with observations about conducting social science research to inform the MPA process."
