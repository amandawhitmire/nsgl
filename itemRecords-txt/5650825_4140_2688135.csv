10,Abstract:,"In light of the declining catches and failure of many marine fisheries, biologists dissatisfied with the effectiveness of current management practices have recently advocated the use of harvest refuges as a potentially effective strategy for protecting and enhancing harvestable stocks. In particular, harvest refuges may increase the resiliency of heavily exploited fisheries during times of environmental extremes. The purpose of this paper is to discuss several conceptual issues pertaining to the design, management, and performance assessment of marine harvest refuges, focusing on environmental and ecological information necessary for the successful implementation of refuges as a tool for managing reef fish fisheries."
