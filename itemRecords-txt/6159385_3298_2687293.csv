11,Abstract:,Knowledge of the biosynthesis of N-N containing natural products is limited. Feeding experiments with 13C and 15N-labeled molecules establish that the phthalazinone core of azamerone is derived from the diazo chlorinated meroterpenoid SF2415A3. A biosynthetic mechanism involving an oxidative rearrangement of the aryl diazoketone followed by rearomatization with the dinitrogen group is proposed.
