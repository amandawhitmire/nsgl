11,Abstract:,"The leopard shark, ""Triakis semifasciata"", is one of the commercially and recreationally important shark species from California. Part of this study was initiated to develop age determination techniques for use in producing a reliable growth curve, and to describe the size- and age-specific reproductive capabilities of the leopard shark. Information from recaptured sharks is updated herein, and combined with the results of this study to produce more complete information on the growth and reproduction of this species."
