10,Abstract:,"Pentachlorophen​ol (PCP), a general biocide utilized as an insecticide, herbicide, algicide, and fungicide, is primarily used for wood preservation. In general, PCP release into the aquatic environment has been characterized by the short-term influx of relatively high concentrations of the biocide. Therefore, the toxicity of pentachlorophen​ol has been assessed in many aquatic organisms, including eastern oysters, goldfish, and rainbow trout. In this study, both the toxicokinetics and biotransformati​on of PCP, in relation to its toxicity, are described in juvenile topsmelt (""Atherinops affinis""). Topsmelt range from Vancouver Island south to the Gulf of California and, while not directly consumed by humans, represent a substantial food source for many economically important fish."
