10,Abstract:,"The Pacific geoduck, Panopea abrupta is a large hiatellid clam, found in soft intertidal and subtidal substrates in the Northeast Pacific from California to Alaska, and it may be found west to japan. Geoducks are found in the low intertidal to depths of more than 60 m. Geoducks are extremely long-lived, with many examples of animals aged at over 100 yr. There is a paucity of peer-reviewed information on Panopea abrupta or its congeners. This is particularly true for intertidal P. abrupta, as no tribe or regulatory agency currently surveys intertidal geoduck clams. Thus, although published reports on geoduck population parameters are available, these publications focus on subtidal geoduck clams. Part of our common understanding about geoduck clams is derived from the substantial amount of information and data on P. abrupta originally published in Washington State and Canadian technical reports, which were not subjected to peer-review. There are two particularly noteworthy cases in point: whether geoducks are found in high abundance below 25 m is unclear from the peer-review literature; however, nearly every paper cites the same pilot video survey work that indicated geoducks are found to 110 m. Additional, whether P. abrupt is found only from California to Alaska, or is also found south to Baja, California and/or wets to Japan is unclear."
