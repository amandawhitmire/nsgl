13,Abstract:,"Salmonid species of the genera ""Oncorhynchus"", ""Salmo"", and ""Salvelinus"" show varying degrees of salinity tolerance at different stages in their life cycle. An increase in salinity tolerance is one of the fundamental changes that occurs during the parr-smolt transformation. Gill Na+, K+ -ATPase increases 2-5 fold during the parr-smolt transformation and is strongly correlated with increased salinity tolerance. In this study, the ability of cortisol to increase gill Na+, K+ -ATPase activity was examined in several salmonid species during development. Results showed that changes in responsiveness to cortisol occur during salmonid development, vary among species, and may be important in the heterochrony that characterizes the parr-smolt transformation."
