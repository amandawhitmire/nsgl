10,Abstract:,"This is a preliminary report on the use of starch gel electrophoresis to assess the genetic structure of four populations of white sturgeon. At least one variant allele was found at seven of nineteen loci studied. The preliminary data identify sufficient allelic variation among the populations to justify extended use of allozyme markers to distinguish populations of white sturgeon. Average heterozygosity ranged 4.9-6.9% in three populations with ocean access, while a landlocked population from the Kootenai River had a value of only 1.4%."
