15,Abstract:,"Management of California's coastal resources by the Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and the Fish and Game Commission is guided by the California Marine Life Management Act (MLMA), which became law on January 1, 1999. The MLMA represented a new approach to marine resource management in California because the new legislation required the California legislature to delegate greater management authority to the Fish and Game Commission and the CDFG, and also because the legislation includes consideration of all marine wildlife, not just fished species. The MLMA sets a more conservative tone for managing fisheries by asserting a burden of proof to demonstrate that fisheries and other resource-use activities are sustainable. A key tenet of the MLMA is to manage resources in a sustainable manner using the best available science. The implication is that management of California fisheries should be based on quantitative information about stock sizes. The critical lack of biological information about marine species, however, is hindering management efforts to develop quantitative metrics for fisheries. Also, few socio-economic data are available with which to make objective management decisions. This is a situation that is being confronted around the world. Managers, industries, and governments are wondering what fishery management options are feasible given the diversity of fisheries and the capacity and budgetary constraints that fishery managers face. To begin to answer this question, the California Sea Grant Extension Program and the California Department of Fish and Game convened a workshop from December 1-4, 2008, in Berkeley, CA. The workshop, entitled ""Managing Data-Poor Fisheries: Case Studies, Models and Solutions,"" was designed to review and discuss new approaches for managing data-poor stocks of marine fishes and invertebrates and to provide ideas to CDFG about ways to manage fisheries when available data are insufficient for single species or ecosystem-based management. The workshop included the advance distribution of a series of draft manuscripts and selected presentations from invited national and international experts in the design of analysis techniques and strategies for managing data-poor fisheries. The workshop also incorporated facilitated sessions with discussions among participants. In opening remarks, Sonke Mastrup, deputy director of CDFG, challenged participants to suggest new management approaches that can achieve the MLMA objectives, be affordable and implementable, involve honest collaborative efforts, and recognize the competing needs of taking both short-term steps and/or long-term strategies for achieving objectives that encompass the range of single species to ecosystem-level management. To address this challenge, workshop participants were divided into five small groups that were charged with providing ideas related to the development of: 1. Alternative strategies for managing fisheries without the need for additional data; 2. New analytical techniques to inform management using available data; 3. New techniques to collect and integrate bio logical and socioeconomic data. Each group, consisting of about 15 people, discussed the three topics with respect to a specific set of fisheries; all discussions were facilitated and ideas were transcribed into notes each day. Only state-managed fisheries were included; federally managed fisheries such as salmon, tuna and groundfish were not discussed. The primary purposes of these facilitated sessions were to stimulate dialogue and the best thinking possible to generate and capture specific suggestions for CDFG about promising ways to manage data-poor fisheries. The results of the group discussions were captured, summarized, and distributed in a report to the CDFG. That report can be accessed at: http://mdpf.mlm​l.calstate.edu/​ or http://www. dfg.ca.gov/mari​ne/datapoorfish​eries.asp. After the workshop, 17 of the draft manuscripts presented were submitted, revised, and published in Marine and Coastal Fisheries, an open-access online journal (http://www.fis​heries.org/mcf/​) administered by the American Fisheries Society. Those manuscripts, and an additional 14 manuscripts written specifically for the workshop are presented in this proceedings publication. All of the papers are presented here in categories that correspond to the four main workshop topics: 1. General fisheries information; 2. New management approaches; 3. New analytical techniques; and 4. New ways to collect and integrate data. vi Although many of the papers pertain to more than one topic, we have organized them here by one topic for reference purposes."
