9,Abstract:,"Recent experience with development of platform environmental loading and capacity characterizatio​ns and definition of reliability targets are discussed in the context of design and re-​qualification of offshore platforms. Reliability-​based design criteria developments include specified reserve strength analyses of the intact and damaged structure, intended to demonstrate that the structure has adequate capacity, ductility, reserve strength, and damage tolerance. Re-​qualification criteria developments include definition of guidelines to assist judgements of platform suitability for service. Insights provided by experienced applications of structural reliability methods can improve judgments concerning design and re-​qualification of offshore platforms. Two examples, one in Australia and one in the Gulf of Mexico, are offered."
