14,Abstract:,"Recently, attention has centered on the presence of eicosanoid and eicosanoid-like compounds as natural products in marine algae. Many of these compounds appear to be produced biosyntheticall​y through an initial step involving a lipoxygenase enzyme. Researchers examined the eicosanoid compounds and lipoxygenase activity present in coralline red algae, and report here that aqueous extracts of ""Bossiella orbigniana"" spp. ""orbigniana"" catalyze the oxidation of arachidonic acid, forming a previously unreported ""w""6 eicosapentaenoi​c acid product containing a conjugated tetraene."
