11,Abstract:,"Catastrophic losses associated with pathogenic iridoviruses in both marine and freshwater cultured fishes pose a major threat to the economic viability of aquacultural operations. This study was undertaken to examine in detail both ""in vitro"" and ""in vivo"" properties of experimentally induced infections with white sturgeon iridovirus (WSIV) as they compare to what is currently known of other members of the Iridoviridae found in fishes. Characteristics of the ""in vitro"" propagation of WSIV were examined in six sturgeon cell lines using phase microscopy, viral infectivity assay and transmission electron microscopy."
