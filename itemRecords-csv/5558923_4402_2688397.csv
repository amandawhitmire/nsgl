10,Abstract:,"Wave energy estimated from linear, spectral wave propagation models incorporating refraction and refraction-​diffraction are compared over two bottom configurations: an analytic circular shoal and relatively smooth coastal bathymetry. Agreement between the two models improves with an increase in the width of the incident directional spectrum and with a decrease in bathymetry complexity. There are, however, significant differences between the model transformations of directionally narrow spectra on both bathymetries; pure refraction models are not quantitatively accurate in these cases. Data from a fundamentally low-resolution pitch-and-roll buoy, if used as the sole source of directional information for incident waves, can lead to significant uncertainty in wave heights estimated by the refraction-​diffraction model."
