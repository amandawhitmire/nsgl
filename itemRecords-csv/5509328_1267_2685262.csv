13,Abstract:,"The annual economic impact of California's boating industry exceeds six billion dollars. Coastal ports, harbors, and marinas are the foundation for this economic productivity. Managers of these multimillion-​dollar facilities must make effective decisions in a rigorous environment. They need the latest technical and management information to provide the best service to boat owners and the greatest benefit to waterfront communities for which these facilities are an important economic resource. In 1986 coastal waterfront facility managers in California were surveyed to determine their needs for technical and management information, their operating circumstances, and how best to deliver information to them. This document reports the results of that survey."
