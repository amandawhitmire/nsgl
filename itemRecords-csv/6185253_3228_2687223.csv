9,Abstract:,"Aquacultured (farm-raised) seafood is the fastest growing sector of the world food economy. Aquaculture accounts for nearly half of all seafood production worldwide. About 80% of the seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported from approximately 62 countries and over 40% is aquacultured seafood. As the aquaculture industry continues to grow and compete with wild-caught seafood products, concerns regarding the use of prohibited animal drugs and unsafe chemicals and the misuse of animal drugs in aquaculture operations have increased substantially. (7) Previous US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection results have shown the presence of prohibited antimicrobial agents in imported seafood (Table 1). The FDA prohibits the use of specific antimicrobial agents based on toxicity, antimicrobial resistance and cancer in humans. In the U.S., use of malachite green, nitrofurans, fluoroquinolone​s, or gentian violet as drugs in aquacultured animals is illegal under Section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). And presence of their residues in seafood adulterates the seafood under 402(a)(2)(C)(ii​) of the FFDCA. (8) The FDA developed more sensitive detection methods for chloramphenicol (antibiotic) in seafood in 2001.The FDA testing program for aquaculture drugs was revised and reissued in November 2005. The testing program includes the following prohibited agents that are not approved for use in seafood (Table 2): Antibiotics - chloramphenicol​, nitrofurans, fluoroquinolone​s, quinolones, ivermectin and oxytetracycline​, and Nonantibiotic drugs - Crystal Violet (Gentian Violet), Brilliant Green, Malachite Green and Leucomalachite Green. To comply with part of the special requirements of the Seafood HACCP Regulation (21 CFR 123.12), importers must provide product specifications and an importer verification procedure which could include testing the product and obtaining written guarantee that the regulation is being met."
