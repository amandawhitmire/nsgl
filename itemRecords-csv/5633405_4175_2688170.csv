10,Abstract:,"Straight-sided double cantilever beam (DCB) fracture specimens have been used previously for long-duration environmentally assisted crack growth (EACG) testing. However, the applied strain-energy release rate ""G"" decreases with crack extension. In this study the width taper required to achieve constant-""G"" during crack growth in a DCB fracture specimen is determined for the case of general loading. The width taper is a function of the initial specimen compliance, the crack length, and the stiffness of the loading frame. The compliance of DCB specimens tapered for testing under three loading conditions were verified experimentally. These were constant-load, constant-​strain, and critical spring loading. Specimens designed for critical spring loading are suggested for use in long-term (EACG) experiments. Limitations on the proposed test method related to nonlinear material behavior (e.g., crack bridging) are discussed."
