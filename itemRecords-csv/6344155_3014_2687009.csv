9,Abstract:,"Seafood fraud is illegal and bad news all around. Fraudulent practices can occur in different forms and include: mislabeling or substituting species; low weights or undercounting; and trans-shipments to avoid duties. Species substitution could pose a food safety hazard. For the seafood industry as a whole, sales may be affected by shoppers who change their buying habits due to negative response to bad press."
