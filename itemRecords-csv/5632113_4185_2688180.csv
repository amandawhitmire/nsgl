12,Abstract:,"Infectious diseases caused by parasites occur in people (and animals) throughout the world. There are well-known examples of clinically active antiparasitic agents derived from plant and fermentation sources. Just beginning to emerge are marine natural products with activity against helminth and protozoal organisms. From the most promising among hundreds of sponge extracts obtained from Indo-Pacific organisms, a number of antiparasitic- active compounds were purified. This review combines published literature with unpublished results so that the diversity of active (and inactive) structures can be appreciated."
