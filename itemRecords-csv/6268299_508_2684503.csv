9,Abstract:,"The barred sand bass (Paralabrax nebulifer) has become one of the staples of the near shore recreational fishing fleet of southern California, an area that is populated by more than 20 million people. Since the late 1970s, the barred sand bass (commonly referred to simply as ""sand bass"") has consistently ranked among the top five species in the southern California marine recreational fish catch. From 2000-2003 sand bass ranked first or second in the recreational fishery off southern California only being supplanted once by Pacific (=chub) mackerel during that time. However, since the year 2004 catches of barred sand bass have fallen off precipitously. This valuable marine resource is the target of a highly directed fishery on spawning aggregations, mostly by lower income urban fishers who can afford a modest price for a boat ticket. The impact of the intensive fishing on this critically important species off the heavily urbanized coasts of Los Angeles and Orange counties is totally unknown. The major sand bass fishing sites in the Southern California Bight include the Silver Strand, Del Mar, San Onofre, the Huntington Flats, the inshore portion of northern Santa Monica Bay off Pacific Palisades, Santa Monica, and the Ventura Flats. Estimates of annual barred sand bass landings from all sport fishing activities (shore, pier, private boat, and Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels, CPFVs) from 1980 to 2006 averaged 822,000 fish and ranged as high as 2,122,000 in 1988. Between 1988 and 2002 catches remained relatively stable with peaks in 1989 (1,296,000), 2000 (1,130,000), and 2002 (1,062,000). By 2008 and 2009, annual catches in southern California waters had fallen off to 130,000 and 106,000 fish (Figure 1). From 1980 on, CPFVs and private boats have taken the vast majority of sand bass while fishing the summer spawning aggregations. As fishing effort targeting barred sand bass has increased, concern has been voiced that the stock is becoming over-exploited. The recent decline in catches in this major recreational fishery is cause for great concern."
