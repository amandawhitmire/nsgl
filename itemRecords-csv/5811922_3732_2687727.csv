14,Abstract:,"The effects of lipopolysacchar​ide (LPS) on the central nervous system, one of the first organs to be affected by sepsis, are not completely understood. Rat microglia constitute the main leukocyte-​dependent source of reactive oxygen species in the central nervous system. The purpose of these ""in vitro"" studies was to determine the time- and concentration-​dependent effect of ""Escherichia coli"" LPS on phorbol-12 myristate 13-​acetate-​stimulated O-2 generation from rat microglia. Results suggest that enhanced release of four mediators during stimulation of rat microglia with LPS might play a critical role in the subsequent ability of microglia to generate O-2 ""in vivo"". Potential clinical implications of the findings are discussed."
