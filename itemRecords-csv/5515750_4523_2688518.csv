11,Abstract:,"In south-western Australia, both inland and tidal wetlands are rapidly being invaded by ""Typha orientalis,"" a species considered to be native to the continent, but not to the region. Its dominance of shallow freshwater lakes has been attributed to colonization following severe disturbances to the wetlands soils. The species' enormous success in tidal salt marshes, however, appears to occur with less disruption. Although it is associated with channels that discharge surface runoff, its distribution has expanded well beyond the areas of channel construction. The invasion of south-western Australia salt marshes by ""Typha"" has been attributed to artificially reduced soil salinities. This study investigates how ""Typha orientalis"" invades and replaces the south-western Australia dominant, ""Juncus kraussii."""
