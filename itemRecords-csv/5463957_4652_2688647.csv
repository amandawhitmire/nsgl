10,Abstract:,"Manoalide (MLD), a marine natural product that has been shown to possess potent anti-​inflammatory activity, has been demonstrated to be a direct and irreversible inactivator of phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Inactivation of bee and cobra venom PLA2 has been shown to be time-dependent and irreversible and may involve the selective modification of lysine residues on these enzymes. The study here was designed to elucidate the binding site of MLD on bee venom PLA2. Determination of the amino acids modified and their extent of modification on bee venom PLA2 are also presented."
