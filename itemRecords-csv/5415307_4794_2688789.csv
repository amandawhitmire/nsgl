9,Abstract:,"Manoalide, first isolated in 1980 from the Palauan sponge ""Luffariella variabilis"", was subsequently found to have antiinflammator​y properties and to irreversibly inhibit the enzyme phospholipase A2. In order to provide sufficient manoalide for continued pharmacological evaluation, an extensive collection of ""L. variabilis"" was made from three locations in Palau. Surprisingly, a small number of samples were found to contain two new metabolites, luffariellin A and luffariellin B in place of manoalide and secomanoalide. Specimens containing the luffariellins could only be distinguished by examining the 1HNMR spectra of crude extracts since all specimens were physically indistinguishab​le and gave identical TLC patterns. Both are potent antiinflammator​y agents."
