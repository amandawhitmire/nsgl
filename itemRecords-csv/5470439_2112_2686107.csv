9,Abstract:,"Inputs of sand from stream sources are a critical component of littoral sand budgets for semi-arid coasts. Fluvial sand delivery is the most significant input for most of the littoral cells of the temperate zone; measurements and estimates of its delivery are essential for computing littoral sediment budgets used for scientific, engineering, and management purposes. The purposes of this study are to estimate coastal sand delivery rates and magnitudes for the Santa Clara River, California, and examine spatial and temporal characteristics of coarse sediment transport along its lower reaches. The estimations are based on an erodible-â€‹boundary (banks and bottom) mathematical model of stream processes. Field measurements made along the Santa Clara River are used as model inputs and for calibration purposes. The effects of sand and gravel mining on stream topography, and upstream dams on the stream hydrograph, are included in modelling."
