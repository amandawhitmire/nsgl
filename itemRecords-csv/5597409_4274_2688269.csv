12,Abstract:,"The ability of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin, and growth hormone to promote hypoosmoregulatâ€‹ory ability was examined in juvenile rainbow trout (""Oncorhynchus mykiss""). The results indicate that IGF-I is a potential mediator of the action of GH in seawater adaptation of salmonids."
