10,Abstract:,"Participants of the Workshop on Educating California Coastal and Ocean Managers reached a clear consensus that a graduate-level coastal management program is not only desired by a wide array of individuals working in the field but is necessary to adequately manage California's important coastal resources. These proceedings include presentations by professionals representing government, the private sector, academia, and NGOs, as well as the results of several discussion groups about coastal management and higher education in the state."
