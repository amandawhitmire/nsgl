9,Abstract:,"White spot syndrome is a highly contagious viral disease that has nearly wiped out commercial shrimp farming in Asia. The disease, caused by the white spot syndrome virus, is currently the most costly viral pathogen infecting farmed shrimp worldwide. It infects penaeid shrimp, a family of prawns that includes many commercially farmed and wild species. The first reported epidemic of white spot syndrome was in 1992 in Taiwan, and it has since spread to North America. Today, Australia is the world's only shrimp-growing region that does not contend with the disease."
