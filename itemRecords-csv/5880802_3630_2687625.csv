14,Abstract:,"For the purpose of monitoring stocks of the long-lived yelloweye rockfish (""Sebastes ruberrimus"") in the Gulf of Alaska, age is routinely estimated by counting growth zones in otoliths cross-sections using the break-and-burn technique; however, such age estimates for this species have remained unvalidated. To evaluate these data, age estimations from the break-and-burn technique were corroborated in this study by comparing results from transverse sectioning of otoliths."
