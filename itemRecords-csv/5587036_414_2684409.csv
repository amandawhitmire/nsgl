11,Abstract:,"Gastrulation is a fundamental process of early embryonic development. It involves virtually every aspect of cell and developmental biology and results in the formation of fundamental structural elements around which a developing animal's body plan is organized. Gastrulation is basically a biomechanical process (that is, a problem of cells generating forces in a three- dimensional array, patterned in space and time such that appropriate tissue movements are executed). Three intertwined questions emerge: what cell activities generate forces, how are these cell activities patterned in space and time, and how are the resulting forces harnessed in three dimensional domains? This marine science colloquium attempted to examine gastrulation in a number of vertebrate and invertebrate groups and to specifically address the issue of how these early developmental processes appear in organisms at different phylogenetic levels."
