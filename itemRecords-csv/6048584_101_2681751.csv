8,Abstract:,"The demand for fish and other aquatic products has increased worldwide. In many cases, natural fisheries are overexploited and unable to satisfy the expanding market. Considerable efforts to develop marine aquaculture, particularly for high value products, are encouraged and supported by many countries. Sea urchins, found throughout all oceans and latitudes, are such a group. After World War II, the value of sea urchin products increased in Japan. When Japan?s sea urchin supply did not meet domestic needs, fisheries developed in North America, where sea urchins had previously been eradicated to protect large kelp beds and lobster fisheries (Kato and Schroeter 1985; Hart and Sheibling 1988). As North American fishery stocks were reduced, sea urchin fisheries expanded in South America (Vasquez 1992). In Europe, fishery stocks have also been depleted and aquaculture systems have been developed. Sea urchins have been important since the 19th century for developmental research, and largescale laboratory systems for maintenance of broodstock are found in many universities (Leahy et al. 1978, 1981). Many species of sea urchins are currently fished or cultured (Table 1). Sea urchins are an unusual candidate for aquaculture as they are harvested for their gonads. Both male and female sea urchin gonads are consumed, usually uncooked, but some are salted, pickled, or made into paste. Processed sea urchin gonads remain one of the most valuable seafood products valued over US$100/kg on wholesale markets (www.nmfs.gov/oâ€‹wstrade)."
