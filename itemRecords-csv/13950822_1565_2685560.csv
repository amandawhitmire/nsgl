11,Abstract:,"Beach sediment transport is driven by breaking waves that produce turbulence, currents, and elevate the shoreline water level. Useful predictions of coastal sediment transport and beach evolution require accurate extreme wave event statistics and unbiased seasonal, annual and decadal wave climatologies. ​ From a sediment perspective, wave direction can be as important as wave energy. Wave conditions inside the Southern California Bight are extremely sensitive to the offshore wave energy directional distribution. Offshore boundary condition uncertainty, due to limited directional resolution in buoy and model data, is the largest driver of wave prediction error in the nearshore. Methods are in development to improve boundary conditions by combining buoy data from multiple stations with global wave model output."
