14,Abstract:,"The Humboldt Bay Stewards hosted a one-day public symposium titled, ""Current Perspectives on the Physical and Biological Processes in Humboldt Bay,"" on March 15, 2004. The meeting was held in the Wharfinger Building on the Eureka waterfront. The purpose of the symposium was to examine biological and physical processes to gain a better understanding of Humboldt Bay. The need for the symposium was clear, as there were many plans, projects and studies ongoing at the time. The symposium included 19 presentations and a panel discussion. Ten of these presentations and two appendices are available as PDFs on a CD-R. The following presentations are included on this CD: 1. History of major developments on Humboldt Bay. Donald C.
