15,Abstract:,"The state and federally endangered salt marsh harvest mouse (SMHM, Reithrodontomys raviventris) is endemic to wetlands within the San Francisco Estuary (the estuary) in California. The biology of SMMH is summarized by Smith et al. (this issue); here, we present the most pressing data gaps and research needs (what we have identified as ""Priority Needs""), followed by associated ""Recovery Actions"" from the 2013 Recovery Plan (USFWS 2013), to facilitate the recovery of SMHM throughout its range. To the degree that resources allow, we strongly urge that all the following research recommendations be implemented throughout the species range, in key habitat types, and with replication."
