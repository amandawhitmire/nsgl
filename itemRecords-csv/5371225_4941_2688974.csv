14,Abstract:,"The results of an investigation of yellowfin tuna (""Thunnus albacares"") myoglobin (Mb) indicate that the protein exists with appreciable heme rotational disorder both in whole muscle and isolated protein; furthermore, this degree of disorder is far from equilibrium. Yellowfin tuna Mb has been extensively studied and shown to be insignificantly different from mammalian Mb. The amino acid sequence exhibits some notable differences from the mammalian counterparts, but the altered residues are generally located on the protein surface; contacts within the heme cavity have all been conserved. Native tuna Mb is much more susceptible to autoxidation and exhibits an oxygen off-rate 3-fold faster than that of mammalian myoglobins, but its affinity is very similar to those of mammalian myoglobins."
