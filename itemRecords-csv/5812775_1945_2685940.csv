9,Abstract:,"The Ocean Governance Study Group (OGSG) exists to re- examine the status of ocean governance in the US and to develop management options for achieving responsible stewardship of oceans and coasts. OGSG is composed of 31 ocean policy experts and works in cooperation with ocean policy specialists in government, regional organizations, national interest groups representing industry and environmental concerns, international advisors, and others. The papers in this volume, from a 1998 conference, address topics such as the recent WTO decision on sea turtles; the impact of new technologies on marine life and management; the precautionary principle; the interplay of natural systems and political jurisdictions; and other issues of regional and international environmental law."
