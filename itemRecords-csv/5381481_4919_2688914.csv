10,Abstract:,"This report details the discussion topics and research recommendations of a 1985 conference which addressed non-maritime ports (those not primarily engaged in international trade) and non-maritime activities (commercial fishing, marine recreation, offshore oil and gas exploration and production) in maritime ports and harbors. The increasing use of modern container vessels and other technological advances have brought changes in the nature and extent of port facilities; the problems of port management and planning are discussed."
