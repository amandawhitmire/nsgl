9,Abstract:,"How does one decide if a restoration site has fulfilled its goal of maintaining biodiversity, or whether a mitigation site has replaced lost functions? For habitats that fall under protection, the federal agencies require that unavoidable damages be mitigated, either through restoration of degraded habitats. However, once the projects have been completed, there are few guidelines for assessing ""success"". In order to set standards for restoration or mitigation ""success"" of salt marsh habitat designed for an endangered southern California bird, the author explored the bird's nesting requirements, compared constructed habitats that lack the bird with natural habitats that support it, and selected habitat assessment criteria that best distinguish suitable and unsuitable nesting habitats. Criteria and standards that are scientifically justified, and the approaches used in their development, will have broad use in both the management and enforcement arenas."
