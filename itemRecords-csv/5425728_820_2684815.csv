8,Abstract:,"What sets California's estuaries apart from others in the nation is the degree of variability in the physical environment. During most of the year, they are marine-​dominated systems. During the winter rainy season, they may become completely fresh. In addition, there is substantial annual variation from years with no streamflow to years with major floods. The extremely variable nature of southern California's coastal habitats is not evident from short-term observation. But from over a decade of study, there have been repeated opportunities to witness extreme events within Tijuana Estuary, ranging from catastrophic flooding to unprecedented drought. These events have in turn allowed us to identify how physical factors influence biotic communities, and to quantify the dynamics of estuarine organisms as they respond to environmental extremes. Tijuana Estuary has been designated one of NOAA's National Estuarine Sanctuaries."
