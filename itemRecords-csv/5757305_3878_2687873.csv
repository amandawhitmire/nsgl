13,Abstract:,"In this study, the authors determined if the Pacific oyster, ""C. gigas,"" from two different geographic locations, could acquire thermotoleranceâ€‹. This was accomplished by heat shocking oysters at a predetermined sublethal temperature, followed by exposure to temperatures that were previously determined to be lethal. Evidence is presented that oysters acquired thermotolerance under laboratory conditions, and this induced thermotolerance existed for at least 10 days after the initial heat shock at a sublethal temperature. Preliminary studies indicated that this induced thermotolerance was associated with the expression of a particular heat shock protein."
