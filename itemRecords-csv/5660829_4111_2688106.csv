10,Abstract:,"Interest in vanadium chemistry has increased significantly since the discovery of the first two vanadium enzymes, vanadium bromoperoxidase and vanadium nitrogenase. The activity of vanadium in biological systems extends beyond bromoperoxidase and nitrogenase, although this review is limited to the biomimetic chemistry of the vanadium enzymes, contrasting the enzymatic reactivity with the reactivity of vanadium complexes that mimic aspects of the enzymatic processes. Because these enzymes were discovered relatively recently, the study of functional model complexes is in its infancy."
