9,Abstract:,"The marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula is well established as a prolific source of bioactive natural products that are valued as both drug candidates and resources in biotechnologicaâ€‹l applications. Despite considerable advances over the last decade in identifying how these compounds are biosynthesized, the full potential of many Lyngbya metabolites has not been harnessed due to low amounts isolated from field collections and slow growth in laboratory cultures. To improve Lyngbya natural product yields, we are monitoring possible ways to increase production levels using novel mass spectrometry approaches, and are working towards the development of a reliable heterologous expression platform for Lyngbya biosynthetic pathways. Success in either endeavor will reduce the need for organic synthesis and repeated environmental sampling, and should significantly improve the utility of these organisms in drug discovery efforts."
