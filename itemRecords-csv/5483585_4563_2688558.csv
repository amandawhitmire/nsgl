11,Abstract:,"To obtain more information on the role of prolactin and growth hormone during the parr-smolt transformation of Atlantic salmon, a population of fish in fresh water was sampled from January to June during two consecutive years. Data indicate that growth hormone may play an important role in the development of hypoosmoregulat​ory activity; increased hypoosmoregulat​ory ability also appears to be associated with low prolactin levels. Results are compared with those from studies on the coho salmon."
