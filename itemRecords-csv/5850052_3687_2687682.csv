12,Abstract:,There is evidence that some forms of decapod crustacean aggression may be modulated by serotonin (5-hydroxy- tryptamine; 5-HT). In this study researchers conducted experiments to determine (1) the pharmacodynamic​s of 5-HT in juvenile lobsters; (2) the effects of a range of dosages of 5-HT on a motor behavior used to escape an aversive situation; and (3) the effect of doses that did and did not inhibit this motor behavior on measures of dominance and shelter competition. The authors compare the results to previous accounts of serotonin-​related aggression.
