10,Abstract:,"The applicability and effectiveness of a radiometric dating technique were assessed by comparing radiometric age estimates with ages determined from counts of these vertebral growth bands. Radiometric age estimates in the leopard shark and common thresher shark were too variable to be used; in the Pacific angel shark and white shark, radiometric age estimates were less variable and roughly agreed with estimates from other studies. The high variability of radiometric age estimates is a function of both the analytical limitations of these low-level radioactive analyses and the physiological processes within the calcified vertebral centra. Violations of the `closed system' and `constant uptake' assumptions occurred in all 4 species; thus, present radiometric age estimates are not completely reliable indicators of age. Ultimately, a more comprehensive understanding of the calcium physiology of elasmobranchs is needed to produce confident radiometric age estimates of their calcified structures."
