9,Abstract:,"During my first two decades in Cooperative Extension work with the University of California, responding to industry inquiries sometimes required that I walk across the UC Davis campus to Shields Library and hike up two flights of stairs and trudge into the book stacks to delve for answers to food processing and regulatory inquiries. Another laborious and time-consuming option was to drive to the UC Davis School of Medicine library, which was located even farther from my office. There was no easy access to electronic databases and online resources when I launched my career in public service. Thus a significant amount of time and effort was spent physically going to the campus libraries and manually reviewing the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Food Science and Technology Abstracts and other key resources."
