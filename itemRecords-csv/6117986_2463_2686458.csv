11,Abstract:,"Islands, four of which are freshwater species. All species are treated in a key, but only marine species are illustrated and treated in detail. Information on their nomenclature, counts and measurements, distinctive characters, coloration, distribution and habitat is presented. Two new species, Cabillus caudimacula, and Pleurosicya larsonae are described. An unidentified species of Favonigobius from Oahu, a possible introduction, is discussed. The Gobiidae is the largest family of marine fishes, with many species also occurring in fresh water. J.S. Nelson (pers. commun., September 2003) estimates that there are about 220 genera and 2010 species. Judging from the number of undescribed species of gobies of which we are aware, that number of species will surely be exceeded. Most gobies are small (the shortest goby is Trimmatom nanus, with females maturing at as little as 8 mm standard length; but one species, Glossogobius giuris, attains 500 mm standard length). Gobies generally are recognized by their pelvic-fin structure; the fins usually are fused to form a sucking disc which may have an anterior transverse membrane called a frenum that links the spines. When the pelvic fins are separate, they are close together. Gobies and sleepers (family Eleotridae) have been confused in the past, and some gobies with separate pelvic fins have been misidentified as sleepers. Gobies have five branchiostegal rays, whereas the sleepers have six, and the pelvic fins are more broadly separated than in the gobies with the pelvic fins divided. All Hawaiian gobies normally have six spines in the first dorsal fin, except for Discordipinna griessingeri with five. Most gobies, and all in Hawaiian waters, also usually have two separate dorsal fins. The Hawaiian Islands have a total of 34 species of gobies, four of which (Awaous guamensis, Lentipes concolor, Sicyopterus stimpsoni, and Stenogobius hawaiiensis) are fresh water. In 1905, Jordan and Evermann recognized eight marine gobies in the Hawaiian Islands. Gosline and Brock (1960) found 13. As a result of collecting since then, the number is now 30. These 30 marine species occur in salt to brackish water from tidepools high in the splash zone to moderate depths. One species was recently taken by trawl in 138-169 m. Although some gobies, such as species of the genus Bathygobius, can readily be seen scurrying around tidepools, most are secretive and not easily observed. They are, however, an important part of the communities in which they are present. In a survey of the fishes of K�ne'ohe Bay, Greenfield (2003) found that the most abundant species taken in collections using an ichthyocide was the goby Eviota epiphanies. In reference to species of Eviota, Greenfield and Randall (1999) wrote ""These small gobies may form an important component of the food of larger piscivorous fishes."" Other gobies, of course, also serve as prey to larger fishes. Although all species are treated in our key, only the marine species are included in this paper. Several small individuals of a goby species in the genus Favonigobius were taken at Kahana Bay, O'ahu, but were too small to be identified."
