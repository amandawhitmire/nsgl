9,Abstract:,"Lophotoxin has been isolated and purified from various species of coral of the genus ""Lophogorgia"". Its diterpenoid structure makes it unique among neuromuscular blocking agents since it does not carry a positive charge. Studies in isolated neuromuscular preparations have revealed a postsynaptic site of action that is not reversed with prolonged washing. In this study we have examined lophotoxin antagonism of the nicotinic receptors in BC3H-1 cells in order to (1) delineate further its site of action and (2) ascertain its utility in studying the coupling between ligand occupation and response."
