10,Abstract:,"Six vessels took part in the UC Sea Grant Extension Program's field demonstration of nontoxic boat bottom coatings from 2002-2003. Three coatings - a two-part epoxy, a ceramic-epoxy and a silicone-rubber - were each applied to a powerboat and a sailboat. Throughout the project we collected data on the status of the coatings, fouling and hull cleaning. We asked the owners for annual performance reports during 2003-2007. Comments shown below regarding boats with epoxy and ceramic-epoxy coatings are based on annual discussions with the owners or boatyard operators that service the their boats. The most recent discussions were in October 2007. Comments regarding boats with silicone-rubber coatings are based on late 2003 discussions with their owners. Comments reflect owners' experiences with a limited number of boats and are not a recommendation or endorsement of the coatings."
