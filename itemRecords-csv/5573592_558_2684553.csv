10,Abstract:,"The 1982-84 El Nino provided an opportunity to reexamine how warm water events affect the relationship between kelps and sea urchins in Southern California. The Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego is one of the best known kelp communities in the world, having been under nearly continuous study since 1956. After about 15 years of relative stability, the population of ""Macrocystis pyrifera"" in this kelp forest was again devastated by the storms and warm water of the 1982-84 El Nino. How this event affected the availability of algal drift (the primary food of these grazers), the patterns of sea urchin recruitment at 5 sites before, during, and after this event, and changes in urchin density and behavior within the Point Loma forest are reported."
