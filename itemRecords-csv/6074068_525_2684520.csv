11,Abstract:,"This special issue of the journal ""Biological Invasions"" includes papers from the Third International Conference on Marine Bioinvasions, held in La Jolla, California in March 2003. The conference focused on marine invasion research and its application in education, management, and policy development. Topics include the biology and ecology of introduced organisms and their impacts; vectors responsible for introductions; distribution and patterns of dispersion; evolutionary consequences; and management issues."
