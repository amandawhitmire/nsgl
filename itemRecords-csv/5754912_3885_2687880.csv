10,Abstract:,"Larvae of the bryozoan ""Bugula neritina"" harbor bacterial symbionts. These symbionts were identified as a novel species of gamma proteobacterium​, based on ribosomal small- subunit rRNA gene sequences. In situ hybridization with oligonucleotide​s specific for the symbiont confirmed the origin of the sequence. The taxonomic status '""Candidatus"" Endobugula sertula' is proposed for the larval symbiont."
