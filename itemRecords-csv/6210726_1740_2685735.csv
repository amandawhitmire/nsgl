14,Abstract:,In this project I plan to construct a length-based population model for mako sharks off the coast of California and Baja California. I intend to determine the number of breeding stocks and the degree of admixture using microsatellite analysis and will conduct a stock assessment(s) on the mako shark population(s). A length-based matrix model will also be built to determine the dynamics of the population. Elasticity analysis will be used to determine which classes have the largest impact on the population dynamics.
