10,Abstract:,"Rapid change is a major feature of modern estuaries and coasts. In numerous systems, invasive species are a primary force altering the structure and function of communities. Nonindigenous species take on nearly all possible ecological roles, serving as agents of disease, parasites, primary and secondary producers, predators, competitors, facilitators, and disturbers. Here, major functional impacts are assessed by considering invasive species as nutrient and biogeochemical modifiers, trophic transformers, and structural engineers. Both plant and animal invasions have the ability to dramatically alter habitat properties and energy flows, shifting ecosystems from one type or state to another, with different functional attributes. Invaders can also impact longer-term, evolutionary dynamics through alteration of selection regimes and hybridization. The ecosystem-level consequences involve changes to emergent structural and functional properties and to ecosystem services. Biodiversity, spatial heterogeneity, connectivity, succession, stability, and resilience all may be modified by invasion. Ecological impacts are often heavily intertwined with ecosystem services, in terms of both positive and negative consequences for humans. Invaders play key roles in fisheries, aquaculture, shoreline stabilization, remediation and restoration, and carbon sequestration. Several decades of invasion research allow us to identify the settings most likely to experience highly modified functions when invaded, and to synthesize the nature and magnitude of invasion effects on ecosystem function."
