9,Abstract:,"Na+,K+,-ATPase, the sodium pump, is ubiquitous in animal cells. This ion-​translocating enzyme performs a variety of functions. Transport tissues such as the teleost gill and skin and the vertebrate kidney contain many cell types, of which those involved in net ion transport may be a minority. Precise localization of these cells is important in determining sites of ion transport. The use of fluorescence to localize membrane components such as Na+,K+,-ATPase allows the examination of living tissue directly and instantaneously​. This study examines anthroylouabain fluorescence in ion transport tissue of two teleost species, where it is shown to bind specifically to Na+,K+,-​ATPase-​rich chloride cells. This technique should have applications to other tissues and species where ouabain-​sensitive Na+,K+,-ATPase is present in high concentrations."
