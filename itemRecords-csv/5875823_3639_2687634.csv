9,Abstract:,"Xanthan gum is a polysaccharide produced by the obligate aerobic bacterium ""Xanthomonas campestris."" Xanthan gum provides stable viscosity over a wide range of temperatures and has compatibility with high ionic environments. This paper describes a strategy for chemostat fermentation of ""X. campestris"" for evaluating its physiological processes and for xanthan gum production."
