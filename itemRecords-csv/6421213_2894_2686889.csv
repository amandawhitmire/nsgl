15,Abstract:,"The Seafood Health Facts Website is designed to be a comprehensive resource on seafood products for healthcare providers and practitioners and their patients. It is also intended to be a resource for consumers to obtain objective information on seafood products. The information on this site is organized by topic and includes resources for seafood nutrition and the benefits of seafood consumption, seafood safety and the risks associated with certain types of seafood, a comparison of the risks and benefits of seafood consumption, and the seafood supply in the U.S. It is also organized to provide different types of resources appropriate for different groups of people. The educational materials and other resources for each of the seafood and health related topics are organized into three different sections based on their usefulness for: the general public; healthcare professionals; and scientific publications for all groups. This project was supported through USDA/CSREES Award No. 2007-​51110-​03815."
