12,Abstract:,"Rarely in the course of a marine infestation has it been possible to prevent a new species from becoming established or to control small, localized populations of non-native species. Unfortunately, we currently have the opportunity in the Northeastern United States with the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis. A native of Korea and China, the mitten crab was first identified on the eastern seaboard in the Chesapeake Bay and has since spread north to the Delaware and Hudson River systems. Given the potential threats to ecosystems, the economy and public health posed by the mitten crab, as well as the overwhelming difficulty and cost of eradicating nonnative species once established, we have convened a regional partnership focused on prevention and rapid response to prevent mitten crabs from becoming established in the Gulf of Maine. A collaboration of citizens, non-profit organizations, state agencies and professionals is engaged in an early detection network to prevent unintentional introductions and to document and remove live mitten crabs. Habitat data (e.g., watershed area, tidal intrusion, salinity intrusion, mean flushing days) were analyzed to focus citizen scientist monitoring efforts in areas most vulnerable to invasion. In concert with the Northeast Aquatic Nuisance Species Panel and state agency personnel, we are preparing a Northeast Rapid Response Plan to coordinate response to individuals detected by the network. By engaging diverse partners in a robust outreach program and establishing a coordinated response protocol for dealing with identified individuals, we seek to successfully prevent the establishment of this approaching invader."
