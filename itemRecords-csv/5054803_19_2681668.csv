14,Abstract:,"In this summary of our program's activities during 1978-79 we highlight our progress by describing some of the many projects supported by Sea Grant throughout the state. It is not possible in a short summary, to adequately describe all of our projects or to name all of the faculty, research and professional staff, and students engaged in Sea Grant activities. In 1978-79 alone, more than 450 such individuals contributed to Sea Grant re search, education, and advisory services. A complete listing of projects supported during this funding year, however, is provided at the end of this booklet.Â In many ways, California Sea Grant serves as the nexus for marine activities in the state by bringing together the ideas, talents, and energies of those who work in, manage, use, develop, or conduct research in the marine environment. Sea Grant plays a vital role in finding solutions to the problems and challenges Californians face with respect to our ocean and coastal resources."
