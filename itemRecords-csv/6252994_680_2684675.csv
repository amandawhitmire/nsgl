8,Abstract:,"This brochure presents attractive alternatives to ornamental pond plants that cause problems in California waterways. While the suggested plants may not be exact substitutes for the invasive species, we have tried to list plants that will fulfill water gardeners' needs. Consult your local aquatic gardening specialist to determine which plants are best for your setting. It is also vital to follow safe gardening practices: Build your water garden away from natural waterways. Plant non-invasive alternatives. Place plants in containers to reduce the likelihood that they will spread. This also simplifies pond maintenance. Dispose of unwanted pond plants by composting or placing in plastic bags in a trash container. Become familiar with California's laws regarding invasive aquatic plants so you do not purchase something that is restricted. This is especially important when shopping on the internet. (See the websites on the back panel of this brochure.)"
