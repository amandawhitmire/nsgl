10,,"Proliferative kidney disease of salmonids, caused by an unclassified protozoan (PKX), has become important in California. Epidemiological and morphological data indicate that observed myxosporidian trophozoites and developing spores are later stages of the PKX parasite; this hypothesis was upheld by experiments described here. A more precise taxonomic placement depends on observations of mature spores."
