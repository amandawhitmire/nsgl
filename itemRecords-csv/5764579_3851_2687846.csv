15,Abstract:,"Members of the kinesin superfamily of motor proteins are essential for mitotic and meiotic spindle organization, chromosome segregation, organelle and vesicle transport, and many other processes that require microtubule-​based transport. A compound, adociasulfate-​2, was isolated from a marine sponge ""Haliclona"" (also known as ""Adocia"") species, that inhibited kinesin activity by targeting its motor domain and mimicking the activity of the microtubule. Thus, the kinesin-​microtubule interaction site could be a useful target for small molecule modulators, and adenosulfate-2 should serve as an archetype for specific inhibitors of kinesin functions."
