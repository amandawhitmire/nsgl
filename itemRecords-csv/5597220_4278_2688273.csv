16,Abstract:,"This paper attempts to assess the present status of the growth hormone insulin-like growth factor axis in regulating growth and other processes in poikilothermic vertebrates. In teleost fishes, the group most extensively studied, the main elements of the liver-mediated response to growth hormone appear to be present. IGF-I also has other effects on fish physiology including osmoregulation. Thus the basic mechanisms characterizing the mammalian system are operative in these higher bony fishes. The advanced evolutionary position of these animals suggests that the fundamental system was present in early ancestral vertebrates and that it has been conserved during phylogeny."
