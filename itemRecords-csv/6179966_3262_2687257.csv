9,Abstract:,"A needs assessment survey of sanitation, good manufacturing and hygienic training practices was conducted to determine whether an Internet-based distance learning program could address training and information needs. Based on the results of the survey, an Internet training program that summarizes the requirements of the current U.S. Good Manufacturing Practices (21 CFR Part 110) was developed and launched in 2008. U.S. food processors, distributors and warehouses are required to comply with the GMP regulation. This presentation discusses the methods and purpose of this new Internet self-learning program which uses the open source course management system known as Moodle. (Moodle stands for ""Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment"" which is a software package used for creating internet-based courses and web sites.)"
