10,Abstract:,"Three new acetylenes have been isolated from a sponge ""Haliclona"" sp. collected in Palau. While the three new acetylenes are simpler in structure than many of the polyacetylenic compounds reported previously, they are unusual because they possess a methyl substituent on the methylene backbone."
