10,Abstract:,"For the past 10 years, the USC Sea Grant Graduate Student Trainee Program has offered students the opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to actual research projects. Students work under the direction of faculty members on Sea Grant-funded research projects and further develop research skills learned in the classroom while working along side principal investigators. ​ The program accomplishes several objectives: 1. It provides qualified students with the opportunity to work under the direction of experienced faculty members. 2. It provides students with the opportunity to do marine research that may contribute to a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation. 3. It provides Sea Grant principal investigators with qualified students who will substantially contribute to the success of projects. 4. It provides students with experience in their chosen fields to help prepare them for leadership roles in marine research. Project titles mentioned in this report include: Problems of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (R/EQ-31); Nutritional Implications of Dissolved Organic Material in Seawater for Culturing Oysters, Crassostrea gigas, (R/RD-27); Population Policies in California's Coastal Zone (R/CM-29); Corrosion Fatigue of Weldments in Offshore Structures (R/CE-8); Origin and Distribution of Enigmatic Upper Slope Depressions on the Arguello Slope, California (R/RD-26); and Small Seaports: An Examination of Selected Attributes and Analysis of Trends (R/CM-30)."
