10,Abstract:,"The discovery of compounds such as the didemnins and the eudistomins, that show promising antitumor and antiviral properties has led to a surge of interest in the metabolites of tunicates. The majority of these metabolites are either cyclic peptides or alkaloids that are derived from amino acids. This paper reports the isolation of the quinolizidine alkaloid pictamine from the Venezuelan tunicate ""Clavelina picta""."
