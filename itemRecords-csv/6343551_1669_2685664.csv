12,Abstract:,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) implemented to conserve biodiversity must protect many species with a broad range of movement characteristics​. To meet that goal, size and spacing guidelines have been used in MPA network design as a proxy for explicitly representing connectivity and species movement. However, there has been no assessment of the biological effects of these simple rules. We evaluated these guidelines by estimating population persistence with a spatially explicit population model over: (1) an idealized coastline and (2) an example from California, USA. Persistence of a species within an MPA network depends strongly on its movement characteristics​; therefore we used the number of combinations of larval dispersal distances and adult home range diameters as an index representing the number of species that could be protected by a MPA network. The index of species protected usually increased steadily with increasing MPA size. By contrast, decreasing MPA spacing only produced large increases in the index when spacing became close enough to allow species persistence via network connectivity rather than self-​replenishment. Species persistence also depended on the exploitation rate outside MPAs. Size and spacing guidelines are a simple and useful way to begin the MPA network design process, but meeting these guidelines does not guarantee persistence for all populations one may wish to protect. The use of spatially explicit population dynamics models that evaluate population persistence directly provides a more comprehensive basis for comparing proposed MPA network designs."
