10,Abstract:,"Demands on the fisheries manager have changed radically in the past two decades. The complexity of such issues as the length of a fishing season or the regulation of mixed-species fisheries requires not only biological but political, economic, and sociological considerations as well. Management and communications skills have become essential. In this proceedings of a meeting sponsored by California Sea Grant in April 1986, the education and training of fisheries managers are addressed from several perspectives to see how universities, industry, and government agencies can respond to changing needs."
