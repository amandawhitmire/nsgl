10,Abstract:,"Changes in the fatty acid composition of tissue membrane lipids are routinely seen in response to dietary changes. Furthermore, biochemical studies show that specific changes in the fatty acyl composition of membrane phospholipids alter cellular and physiological processes, such as platelet aggregation, leukocyte chemotaxis, macrophage cytolysis, and tumor metastasis. Since these processes are frequently unbalanced in disease states, manipulation of membrane composition could result in important clinical benefits. Manipulation of fatty acids in membranes also alters synthesis of their oxygenated derivatives. Since different fatty acid oxygenation pathways show varying sensitivity to nutritional modulation, it is of interest to investigate how 12-lipoxygenase activity is regulated by dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Dietary supplementation with fish oil has been suggested to be beneficial in some disease states that involve arachidonic acid metabolism. The present study investigated differences in metabolism and incorporation of n-3 PUFA from two sources, linseed oil and menhaden fish oil, as they compare with safflower oil and olive oil, not containing n-3 PUFA."
