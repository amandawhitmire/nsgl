13,Abstract:,"This project assessed the physiological basis for reduced phytoplankton growth in Suisun Bay, prior to the major upgrade at the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (SRWTP), which is responsible for 90% of the nitrogen released into the bay. The work involved analyzing almost three decades of historical field data from the bay-delta and using it to build a model to evaluate environmental drivers of phytoplankton biomass. Discoveries from the field data were then tested through laboratory culturing experiments. By illuminating the interacting effects of bottom-up drivers (light, nutrients, salinity) on phytoplankton, this research helps provide a fundamental understanding of this complex ecosystem."
