10,Abstract:,"Since 1969, the University of Southern California (USC) has been a member of the National Sea Grant Program as a Sea Grant Institution. The University, however, has been in the marine science business for nearly 70 years. Through those years USC has contributed on a continual basis to the understanding of the marine environments of western North America. The initial years as a Sea Grant Institution were ones of organization and planning. Today, the USC Sea Grant Program reflects the mandate of the Sea Grant legislation of 1966 and incorporates the perceived institutional needs of the state, regional and local units and the industrial community of southern California. This annual report for the USC Sea Grant Program is for the period of July 1, 1971 - September 15, 1972."
