13,Abstract:,"Marine invertebrates are sources of a diverse array of bioactive metabolites, which, in many cases, are known or suspected to be biosynthesized by microorganisms. The authors of this paper discuss the application of molecular microbiology to the study of marine invertebrate- microorganism relationships in contributing to basic biological knowledge and facilitating biotechnologica​l development of these valuable resources. Examples include the bryostatin-​producing bryozoan ""B. neritina"" and its specific symbiont ""Candidatus Endobugula sertula"", and the listhistid sponges."
