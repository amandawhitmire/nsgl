15,Abstract:,"Objectives of this study were to identify the steroids produced by sturgeon ovarian follicles during oocyte maturation and ovulation and to determine the biological activity of these steroids in inducing GVBD. Because of the high value of cultured gravid females, only two fish were available to study. These two animals responded differently to exogenous hormonal induction of ovulation, thus presenting us with the opportunity to compare steroid profiles in media and plasma in a non-ovulated and ovulated female."
