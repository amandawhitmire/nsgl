10,Abstract:,"Allozyme electrophoresis was used to characterize genetic variation within and among natural populations of the red sea urchin ""Strongylocentr​us franciscanus."" Adult urchins were sampled from twelve geographically separated populations from northern and southern California. Significant population heterogeneity was observed, and no geographic pattern of differentiation was evident. In order to assess within-​population genetic variation and patterns of recruitment, researchers also collected large samples from several populations and divided them into three size classes, representing large adults, medium-sized individuals, and individuals <2 yr of age ('recruits'). Comparisons of allelic counts revealed significant spatial and temporal differentiation among these size-stratified samples. Recruit samples differed significantly from adult samples collected at the same locale, and showed extensive between-year variation. The authors discuss potential explanations."
