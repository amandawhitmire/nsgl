9,Abstract:,"Previous work has identified an anti-​cholinoceptive action at frog and rat neuromuscular junctions by lophotoxin (LoTx), an uncharged and nonpolar diterpenoid produced by gorgonians (sea fans) of the genus ""Lophogorgia"". Physiological and biochemical studies have indicated that LoTx action results from non-reversible or very slowly reversing interaction with the nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nAChR) and competition for the cholinoceptive site, despite its unusual chemical structure for a nicotinically active substance. Reported here is evidence that, in distinction from the ""a""-​neurotoxins, LoTx irreversibly blocks nicotinic transmission in sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Such action implies that LoTx can fill a long-standing need for a tightly binding biochemical and physiological probe with action on both of the presently known nAChR sub-types."
