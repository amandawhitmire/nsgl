18,Abstract:,"Salmon hatcheries have succeeded in rearing ever larger numbers over the years but total recovery (ocean and river catches and hatchery returns combined) has not increased correspondinglyâ€‹. It appears that wild coho salmon migrate to the ocean on some natural cue (photoperiod, lunar, rainfall, temperature change, etc.) when they are physiologically competent to enter the ocean. However, a truly reliable indicator of ideal release time continues to elude us. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that release of fish on (or shortly after) the new moon closest to the vernal equinox will result in fish entering the ocean at a physiologically optimal time, adapting rapidly to seawater, and thus lead to enhanced adult recovery. Results are discussed."
