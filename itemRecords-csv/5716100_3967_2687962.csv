10,Abstract:,"Thiocyanato and isothiocyanato organic compounds are a newly discovered class of marine natural products with potent antifungal, antibacterial, ichthyotoxic and other biological activities. The thiocyanato-​marine natural products are rare compared to the isothiocyanato compounds. The biosynthesis of the thiocyanato marine natural products, like the isothiocyanato marine natural products is obscure, with even fewer reports of biogenesis studies compared to the isothiocyanato compounds. The authors report on the reactivity of vanadium bromoperoxisase with thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide."
