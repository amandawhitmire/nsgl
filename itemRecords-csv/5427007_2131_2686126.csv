9,Abstract:,"Coincident with the Christmas season in the Peruvian and Equadorian coastal areas, the normally cold water of the north-flowing Peru Current is displaced by a warm, southward current associated with a decrease in nutrients and a temporary reduction in fishing success. Occasionally, however, the warm current strengthens and persists for a year or more, usually with a catastrophic effect on the important anchoveta population and the various populations which depend on it. The 1982-1983 El Nino was the largest ever measured and reached into high latitudes of the eastern Pacific in both the southern and northern hemispheres. The most direct effects and the most thoroughly studied aspects are oceanic, especially planktonic food webs. Here, the effects of this massive oceanic phenomenon on the nearshore kelp communities of the southern California Bight are reviewed."
