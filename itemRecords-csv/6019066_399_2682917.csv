10,Abstract:,"This report, available in pdf format on a CD, represents the first effort to compile various data sets from the mapping and dating of 26 dune sheets in the central west coast of North America. Using geographic information systems, the authors modified digital maps of surface geology and topsoils to produce proxy maps of potential dune sheet deposits in Oregon. The distributions of dune deposits were groundtruthed by extensive morphostratigra​phic profiling in the Oregon dune sheets. Dune sheet deposits were previously discriminated and mapped along the coasts of southwestern Washington, California, and Baja California. Representative morphostratigra​phic profiling was completed in this study for the previously published dune units of southwestern Wash- ington, northern and central California, San Miguel Island, and Baja California Sur. In this report the authors compile available radiocarbon dates (248 in number) from coastal dunes and associated archaeological sites in Oregon, northern California, and Baja California Sur. Subsurface profiles are presented from 646 dune sites that were observed in west-to- east transects across the mapped dune sheets. The profiled sites are georeferenced by UTM coordinates and include details on topsoil development, shallow subsurface lithology, paleosols, and groundwater diagenesis. Measured subsurface sections (2-30 m depth) include thickness of dune strata and different interbeds, including loess, peat, and diagenetic hardpans. These morphostratigra​phic profiles provide regional information on dune emplacement age, episodic dune sheet reactivation, and relative duration of dune sheet stabilization. Profile data from some sites address potential variation in geotechnical and hydrogeologic properties of the dune deposits. These preliminary results should be of interest to coastal geomorphologist​s, engineering geologists, hydrologists, and archaeologists. A better understanding of the geotechnical and hydrological properties of these coastal plain deposits will benefit planning for sustainable development in the coastal zone."
