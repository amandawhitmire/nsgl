12,Abstract:,"Microbiologicalâ€‹ly induced corrosion (MIC) is due to the activities of microorganisms on metal surfaces which may lead to changes of the rates and types of electrochemical reactions involved in the corrosion process. In this study of MIC of copper alloys an attempt was made to determine kinetic parameters characteristic of corrosion processes such as the Tafel slopes ba and bc which are determined in abiotic and biotic media. Since it can be expected that the formation of corrosion product layers and biofilms during exposure to natural seawater can affect these parameters, polarization curves were recorded as a function of exposure time in both media. Finally, it is well known that for Cu in chloride media, both the anodic and the cathodic partial reaction are affected by mass transport; therefore, a rotating cylinder electrode was used to determine polarization curves as a function of rotation rate."
