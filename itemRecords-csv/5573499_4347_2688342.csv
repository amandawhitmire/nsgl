11,Abstract:,"New approaches are needed for investigating planktonic prey- predator interactions in-situ. Lengthy incubations can lead to several artifacts; microscopic analysis of the gut contents of predators is feasible only if prey leave digestion-â€‹resistant hard parts. The development and first application of an immunoassay that permits detection of predation on soft-bodied, nonloricate ciliates (""Strombidium"" sp.) are reported here. Polyclonal antibodies raised against ""Strombidium"" sp. recognize both intact ciliates and partially assimilated ciliate antigens occurring in a predator's gut. Unequivocal predation by first-feeding larvae of the northern anchovy on nonloricate ciliates is demonstrated by both immunochemical and conventional methods."
