12,Abstract:,"The relationship between plasma thyroid hormone concentrations and the thyroid hormone concentrations in selected tissues was examined throughout the spring during the typical course of parr- smolt transformation in coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") in fresh water and also in coho salmon moved prematurely to seawater. The thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyroninâ€‹e (T3) were extracted from brain, liver, and muscle tissue. Findings indicate complex peripheral regulation of thyroidal status in this teleost and represent the first bridge between compartmental models of thyroid hormone kinetics and actual measurement of tissue pools of thyroid hormones in an ectothermic vertebrate. In summary, tissue concentrations of thyroid hormones did not echo plasma concentrations, indicating that thyroidal status cannot be inferred from plasma data alone."
