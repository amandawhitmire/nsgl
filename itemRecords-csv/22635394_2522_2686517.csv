12,Abstract:,"Goals and Objectives: Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags and PIT tag detection systems (antennas and transceivers) were used to document the status and trends of Russian River coho salmon populations at both stream-specific and basinwide scales. From September 15, 2019, through March 1, 2020, our goal was to collect PIT tag data at multiple sites to document adult hatchery coho salmon return timing, estimate the number of returning hatchery coho salmon adults, and estimate coho salmon smolt to adult return (SAR) ratios in four Broodstock Program monitoring streams (Willow, Dutch Bill, Green Valley, and Mill). In addition, we were able to estimate these metrics for the Russian River basin overall with the exception of SAR ratios because we do not have the ability to estimate the number of smolts leaving the entire Russian River basin each year."
