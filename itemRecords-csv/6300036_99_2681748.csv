11,Abstract:,"California Sea Grant is moving in a fundamentally new strategic direction for 2006-2010. In recognition of recent changes in coastal resource conditions and marine policies, our program's activities will now be structured around five new integrated themes. These new themes should not be viewed as extreme departures from our traditional research, outreach and educational priorities.

We are also pleased to announce a new partnership with the California Ocean Protection Council that will allow us to expand our research portfolio and enhance our partnership with the University of Southern California (USC) Sea Grant Program."
