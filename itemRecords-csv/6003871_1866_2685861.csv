12,Abstract:,"Growth of juvenile ""Strongylocentr​otus droebachiensis"" on an ""ad libitum"" diet of an artificial feed created by Lawrence Lawrence were compared with the most effective natural diet, ""Laminaria saccharina"" with ""Membranipora membranacea"". In an eight-month experiment, individual urchins were fed either a natural or an artificial diet. In a separate three-month experiment, urchins were divided into three size classes (<5, 5-10, 10< mm) and provided with a natural, artificial pellet, or a new version of the artificial diet containing kelp in a pellet or blade-like form. The test diameter of urchins was measured monthly. Regardless of size class, urchins had a greater initial change in test diameter when fed the artificial diet, however, the growth rates on the natural diet were greatest after the third month. Urchins fed the artificial diet had a paler test color and shorter spines."
