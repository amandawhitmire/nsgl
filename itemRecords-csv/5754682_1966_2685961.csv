10,Abstract:,"With the development of sturgeon culture, there are now fish available under controlled conditions to permit systematic studies on reproduction. The authors have made efforts in understanding the endocrine control of reproduction in white sturgeon (""Acipenser transmontanus"")â€‹. As discussed here, they have found that the neuroendrocrine control of reproduction in this species seems to resemble the systems that have evolved in teleosts."
