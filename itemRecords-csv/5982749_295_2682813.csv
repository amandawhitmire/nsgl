11,Abstract:,"In this report, we highlight selected research and outreach topics undertaken by California Sea Grant from March 2002 through February 2004. In doing so, it is our hope to provide a record of accomplishments for the general public and individuals in government, industry and academia. California Sea Grant, the largest of 30 such programs located in the Great Lakes and coastal states, serves the community through university-​based research and outreach. The primary mission of the program is to expand the base of scientific knowledge necessary to promote the sustainable use of California’s coastal and marine resources."
