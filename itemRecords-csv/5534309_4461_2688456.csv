9,Abstract:,"Lipids are necessary for aspects of texture, flavor, color and overall acceptability of most forms of consumed meats. Nevertheless, nutritional research has targeted the lipid or fat component of muscle foods as providing a negative health contribution to the diet. Recent studies suggest this is an oversimplificatâ€‹ion; animal fats are not all metabolically equivalent and some animal lipids are potentially beneficial to health. Research is increasingly focusing on the questions of what are the optimum quantities and types of fats desirable in meat, both nutritionally and functionally, and how are these to be achieved. The challenge is to provide optimal nutrition without compromising the functional or quality attributes historically provided by muscle lipids. This review summarizes these areas with a focus on the similarities and differences between avian, aquatic, and mammalian muscle lipids."
