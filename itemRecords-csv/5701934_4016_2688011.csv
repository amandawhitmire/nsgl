10,Abstract:,"Sponges of the genus ""Dysidea"", abundant in all tropical reefs, are a reliable source of assorted terpenoids. The more than eighty terpenes from ""Dysidea"" exhibit a rich diversity in structures, bioactivities, and even in the names coined for these compounds. In Phuket, Thailand, researchers encountered a bright blue colony of ""D. arenaria"" devoid of chlorophyll-â€‹containing organisms. This species has been the subject of only one prior investigation, which reported the presence of arenarol and arenarone. Here, the structures and cytotoxic properties of two new sesquiterpene ethers, arenarans A and B, are described."
