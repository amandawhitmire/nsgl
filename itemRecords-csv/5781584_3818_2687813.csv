11,Abstract:,"Using a resident-â€‹intruder paradigm, a study of competition for a single shelter between same- and mixed-sex dyads of juvenile lobsters, ""Homarus americanus"" revealed a significantly greater advantage for males than females against intruders of either sex. There was no significant competitive advantage for residents of one sex over intruders of the other. There was a prior residence effect only in the male-male dyad condition. Unexpectedly, there was a reliable intruder advantage in female-female dyads. Shelter-seeking response of the juvenile lobster is a phylogenetic adaptation and juvenile aggressive behavior appears more intense than that of adults."
