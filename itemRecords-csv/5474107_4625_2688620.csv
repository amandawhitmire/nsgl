8,Abstract:,"Seaweeds have been reported from Roman times as a source of agricultural fertilizer, a practice still used today in some areas of the world. While some of their utility is no doubt due to organic nutrients and inorganic minerals, algal constituents have been isolated that exhibit specific control over terrestrial plant growth, e.g. gibberellins and cytokinins. During an ongoing search for natural biologically active compounds, extracts of the red algae ""Odonthalia washingtoniensiâ€‹s"" and ""O. floccosa"" were examined for phytoactive components. The extracted dibromocatechol showed a stimulating effect on the growth elongation of lettuce and rice plants. Described here are its isolation, identification and biological activity."
