8,Abstract:,"The presence of harmful contaminants in fish is a growing public health concern, as evidenced by the increasing number of fish consumption advisories in the United States aimed at limiting the amount of contaminants that reach fish consumers. Consumer reaction to consumption advisories, however, is unpredictable. Being voluntary in nature, advisories typically miss their intended audiences, may be misconstrued to apply to non-target species, and may lead to resource waste if landed fish are discarded due to changes in consumer demand. At the current time, no pre-harvest methods are used to control the amount of contaminants that reach fish consumers. Given that many toxic chemicals bioaccumulate, fish contamination can vary significantly by size- and/or age class. This research aims to investigate the economic feasibility of more directed, size-based management of marine fisheries that explicitly accounts for the dynamics of optimal harvesting in the presence of contamination. An overview of seafood consumption and public health issues will be presented, highlighting why alternative approaches may be needed in order to reduce the public's long-term exposure beyond that achieved through voluntary responses to consumption advisories. Ongoing work to develop a theoretical model and its future application to mercury contamination in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico king mackerel fishery will also be discussed."
