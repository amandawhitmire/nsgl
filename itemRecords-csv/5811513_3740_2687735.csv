13,Abstract:,"The actions of pentachlorophen​ol (PCP) under various water salinities was investigated in live, intact red (""Haliotis rufescens"") and black abalone (""H. cracherodii"") by in vivo 31P NMR. Based on PCP toxicity in red abalone, animals were exposed in flowing seawater to a sublethal PCP concentration and a water salinity of either 25, 35 or 45 0/00. The authors compare the biochemical actions of PCP in the two species at the three different salinities, and discuss whether the biochemical actions were dependent upon differential PCP disposition in the two species."
