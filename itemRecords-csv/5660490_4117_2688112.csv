9,Abstract:,"""Trochus niloticus"", tropical top shell, is the most economically important gastropod in the tropical Pacific, and is both an important traditional food and a leading export item. Its reproduction is not similar to any previously described prosobranch. The population as a whole was asynchronous; nevertheless, the population contained several sub-groups that had synchronized reproductive cycles. The reproductive cycle was approximately eight lunar months. ""T. niloticus"" was a complete spawner with each individual having only one cohort of gametes developing at a time."
