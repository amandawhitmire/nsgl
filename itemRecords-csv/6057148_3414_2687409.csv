10,Abstract:,"Six vessels took part in the UC Sea Grant Extension Program's field demonstration of nontoxic boat bottom coatings from 2002-2003. Three coatings - a two-part epoxy, a ceramic-epoxy and a silicone-rubber - were each applied to a powerboat and a sailboat. Throughout the project we collected data on the status of the coatings, fouling and hull cleaning. We asked the owners for annual performance reports during 2003-2006. Comments shown below regarding boats with epoxy and ceramic-epoxy coatings are based on October 2006 discussions with their owners. Comments regarding boats with silicone-rubber coatings are based on late 2003 discussions with their owners. Comments reflect owners' experiences with a limited number of boats and are not a recommendation or endorsement of the coatings."
