8,Abstract:,"Diving accidents at ocean beaches sometimes leave the swimmer seriously injured and may have catastrophic consequences for the victim's life. ""Plunging-dive"" accidents involve swimmers who run or jog into shallow water and dive toward the base of an oncoming wave, striking their heads against either the gently-sloping seafloor, the slipface of a longshore ridge, or the bottom of a runnel or hole. This study documents the frequency and demographic characteristics of such accidents at two popluar beaches in southern California, along with relevant medical, biomechanical, sedimentologica​l, managerial and legal perspectives. The following papers are included in this report: 1. Frequency and demographic aspects of shallow-water diving accidents in southern California. Kathi K. Beratan and Robert H. Osborne, pp. 3-26. 2. Beach sedimentology. Robert H. Osborne, pp. 27-38. 3. Biomechanics of shallow-water ocean diving accidents. Carley C. Ward, pp. 39-50. 4. Medical aspects of shallow-water diving accidents at southern California beaches. D. Thomas Rogers and Greg Super, pp. 51-54. 5. Health care costs associated with spinal cord injury. Gerry Aster, pp. 55-58. 6. Government liability for ocean accidents. David B. Casselman, pp. 59-62. 7. Liability of public entities associated with diving accidents related to ridge and runnel systems. Wayne J. Austero, pp. 63-66. 8. Beach management aspects. A'Arnall Douglas, Howard Lee and Gilbert Lee, pp. 67-70."
