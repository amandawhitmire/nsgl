13,Abstract:,"This paper is the first report of the conversion of calcium carbonate in nacre to another inorganic within its ordered, interpenetratin​g organic matrix. The investigation suggests that conversion of aragonite to hydroxyapatite (HA) proceeds via dissoluton-​recrystallizati​on, and that preferred orientation of the product is determined by the flux direction of the solution through the material. Other properties of HA-converted gastropod nacre are also discussed."
