10,Abstract:,"Previous research has shown that at low water activities isolated vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum undergo lipid phase transitions, lateral phase separations, and vesicle fusion, resulting in a loss of biological activity on rehydration. However, if dried in the presence of trehalose, a nonreducing disaccharide of glucose, such effects are negated, the vesicles obtained on rehydration being structurally and functionally similar to fresh membrane preparations. The protective effects of trehalose and other naturally occurring carbohydrates on liposome fusion during dehydration are compared, and it is shown that damage to biological membranes which occurs at low carbohydrate concentrations is indeed due to fusion of the membranes during the drying process."
