11,Abstract:,"A prominent hypothesis explaining the success of introduced species on land is that they are typically free of or are less affected by the natural enemies (competitors, predators, and parasites) they encounter in their introduced range compared to their native range. To test this hypothesis in a marine system, researchers conducted a global assessment of the effect of parasitism and predation on the ecological performance of native and introduced European green crab populations. Results are consistent with the general prediction that introduced species suffer less from parasites compared to populations where they are native. This may part explain why the green crab is such a successful invader."
