14,Abstract:,"The brown algae of the family Dictyotaceae are a prolific source of diterpenes. The alga ""Dictyota divaricata"" has been subjected to relatively limited studies in which diterpenes of the dolastane type were reported from Caribbean collections. As reported here, a specimen of ""D. divaricata"" collected from the Andaman and Nicobar coasts in the Indian Ocean contains diterpenes of several structural types including five dolabellanes, six dolastanes, and a novel isodolastane diterpene. One of the dolabellanes has recently been reported from ""D. paradalis"" from the Great Barrier Reef."
