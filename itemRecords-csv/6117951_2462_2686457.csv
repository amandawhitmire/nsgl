11,Abstract:,"A very elongate garden eel, Gorgasia thamani, is described from Koro Island, Fiji. The new species is most similar to G. barnesi, known from the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, but differs by being more slender with a shorter head and mouth and a different head pore pattern. While conducting a survey of the marine fishes of Fiji, a colony of very elongate garden eels was discovered at the west side of Koro Island, Fiji, off Kade Village on a fine sand bottom in 14 to 15.2 m of water. The species, although similar in appearance and length to G. barnesi, differs from that species in a number of characters and is described here. Gorgasia barnesi is known from Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. The new species is placed in the genus Gorgasia because the upper lip is not confluent medially across the face of the snout, the anterior nostrils and ethmoid sensory pores are separate from the upper lip, and the mouth is relatively large and slightly oblique, its angle reaching to below anterior half of eye, characters not present in the only other genus in the subfamily, Heteroconger."
