9,Abstract:,"A 1-yr experiment to test the feasibility of using hatchery-reared abalones to enhance depleted native populations was conducted. Behavior, growth, survival and mortality patterns for two groups of seed averaging 45 and 71 mm at the time of planting were compared with native abalones at the site. Predators and scavengers were collected at the beginning of the experiment to ease pressure on the seed, and thereafter at monthly intervals. Seed growth averaged 30 mm per year; survival as based on the recovery of live seed was about 1%. Seed mortality, estimated from shell collections, was 43%, suggesting that a large proportion of the unaccounted for animals moved away. Intense predation pressure appears to be limiting both the success of seeding experiments and the recovery of native populations."
