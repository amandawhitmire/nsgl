13,Abstract:,"Populations of ""Asterias"" spp. in the southern Maine/New Hampshire coastal zone have undergone significant changes in density, population structure and relative abundance since 1975. Historically, benthic communities have transformed from kelp beds with an understory of ""Chondrus crispus"" to urchin barrens dominated by crustose corallines. Recently, a fluctuating mosaic of urchin barrens, ephemeral algae, ""Mytilus edulis"" beds, and patches of introduced species including ""Codium"" fragile are common. In addition, the numerically dominant northern sea star, ""Asterias vulgaris"", has declined in relative abundance compared to the southern sea star, ""A. forbesi"". Extremes in relative abundance at the Isles of Shoals ranged from 280.3 ""A. vulgaris"" : 1 ""A. forbesi"" in 1976-79 to 1 AV:7 AF in 1996. Population density and size structure of both ""Asterias"" spp. is positively correlated with subtidal ""M. edulis"" beds and is influenced by cannibalism events following decimation of mussel populations."
