18,Abstract:,"Smart Grid and Smart Meter initiatives seek to enable energy providers and consumers to intelligently manage their energy needs through real-time monitoring, analysis, and control. We have developed an inexpensive FPGA implementation of a spectral envelope preprocessor. This FPGA permits cost-effective and richly detailed power consumption monitoring for individual loads or collections of loads. It permits a flexible trade-off between data transmission, storage, and computation requirements in a power monitoring or control system. The information from the FPGA can be used to coordinate the operation of power electronic controls."
