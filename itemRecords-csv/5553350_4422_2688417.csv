10,Abstract:,"Due to the high risks associated with the operation of offshore drilling and production platforms, the potential for catastrophic accidents is substantial. Over 80% of high consequence marine accidents are the result of compounded human and organizational error (HOE), and 80% of these accidents occur during operations. Through formal reliability analyses, the impacts of HOE and HOE management alternatives are examined to determine how checks and balances can be assigned to reduce the incidence of HOE, and to take advantage of 'early warning signs' to interrupt catastrophic compounding of these errors."
