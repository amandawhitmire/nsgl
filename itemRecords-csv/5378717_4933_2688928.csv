11,Abstract:,"A time-depth recorder was attached to a female Northern elephant seal at the end of her lactation fast. The animal dived continuously during its first 11 days at sea (the period recorded) for a total of 653 dives. Mean dive time was 21 min, with the longest submersion lasting 32 min. Mean surface interval between dives was 3 min, resulting in a total surface time of 11%. Mean dive depth was 333 m and the deepest dive was 630 m, the deepest ever recorded for a pinniped. A depth histogram recorder attached to another female yielded a similar frequency distribution of dive depths."
