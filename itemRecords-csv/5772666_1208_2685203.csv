11,Abstract:,"International marine commerce has rapidly accelerated the rate at which nonindigenous species are being introduced in California coastal regions. A workshop on this subject strove: to identify marine, estuarine, and aquatic nonindigenous species and their impacts; and to list research, management, and public outreach needs for dealing with associated problems. These conference proceedings document the current status of and research needs to deal with the problem."
