10,Abstract:,"Inputs to terrestrial systems of newly fixed N2 (the conversion of relatively inert N2 gas to more bioavailable N forms) have more than doubled as a result of human activities including synthetic N fertilizer production, cultivation of legume crops, and combustion of fossil fuels. A portion of this chemically-â€‹combined N is transported to coastal waters where it can lead to changes in coastal ecosystem function. Changes in phytoplankton species composition alteration and loss of seagrass habitats, and increases in carbon fixation, extent and duration of anoxic and hypoxic water, harmful algal blooms, and coral reef degradation are some of the effects associated with excess N inputs to coastal systems. We specifically address land-based inputs of N to the coastal zone in this chapter. Biological N2-fixation occurring within coastal and open ocean regions can contribute substantial additional inputs of N at some times and locations. Of particular note is N from oceanic N2-fixation which is transported into continental shelves from advection of open ocean waters and can considerably exceed land-based N sources to continental shelves."
