21,Abstract:,"Seawater desalination by reverse osmosis (RO) is a reliable method for augmentingdrink​ing water supplies. In recent years, the number and size of these water projects haveincreased dramatically. As freshwater resources become limited due to global climate change,rising demand, and exhausted local water supplies, seawater desalination will play an importantrole in the world’s future water supply, reaching far beyond its deep roots in the Middle East.Emerging contaminants have been widely discussed with respect to wastewater and freshwatersourc​es, but also must be considered for seawater desalination facilities to ensure the longtermsafety and suitability of this emerging water supply. Harmful algal blooms, frequentlyrefer​red to as ‘red tides’ due to their vibrant colors, are a concern for desalination plants due tothe high biomass of microalgae present in ocean waters during these events, and a variety ofsubstances that some of these algae produce. These compounds range from noxioussubstanc​es to powerful neurotoxins that constitute significant public health risks if they are noteffectively and completely removed by the RO membranes. Algal blooms can cause significantoper​ational issues that result in increased chemical consumption, increased membrane foulingrates, and in extreme cases, a plant to be taken off‐line. Early algal bloom detection bydesalination facilities is essential so that operational adjustments can be made to ensure thatproduction capacity remains unaffected. This review identifies the toxic substances, theirknown producers, and our present state of knowledge regarding the causes of toxic episodes,with a special focus on the Southern California Bight."
