8,Abstract:,"In an era of increasing governmental protection of marine resources and accelerating climate change, knowing how benthic populations of marine organisms are connected is of paramount importance. However, little is known about connectivity in the nearshore environment, particularly at ecologically and demographically relevant scales. Because the dispersive larval stage is the key to understanding population connectivity, my dissertation focused on developing a new technique for tracking larvae and determining how larval swimming behaviors can influence their cross-shelf distributions in the dynamic upwelling environment of northern California. This information is relevant not only to the applied fields of invasive species management, stock assessment, and marine protected area establishment, but also to the academic pursuit of understanding how life evolved in the sea."
