14,Abstract:,"During the past decade, the northern California Current has experienced dramatic inter-annual variability in ocean conditions, including both delayed and intensified upwelling, anomalous near-shore hypoxia, and decoupling of conditions between Northern and Southern regions. Managers require a better understanding of the impacts of such variability on marine ecosystems to adapt to increased climate variability and climate change, yet it is not possible to monitor all ecosystem components. Our long term goals are to better understand interannual and seasonal changes in food web relationships and work towards a low-cost index of prey populations to aid coastal monitoring and management. We employed collaborative fisheries research techniques with synoptic observations of a major seabird colony to determine the diets of a suite of upper trophic level consumers on the central Oregon coast. Focal predators, selected based on their ecological importance, abundance, and accessibility for sampling, included common murres (Uria aalge) Chinook and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawyscha and O. kisutch), black rockfish (Sebasetes melanops), and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). Together, these species should reflect food web wide adjustments resulting from subtle biophysical changes in ocean dynamics. We report on 8 years of data for the common murre, as well as preliminary results from our first field season of intensive sampling of all predators. Primary prey items among predators included Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), smelts (Osmeridae), Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus), and juvenile rockfishes (Sebastes spp.)."
