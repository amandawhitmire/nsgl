14,Abstract:,"Low levels of genetic variation at traditional molecular markers have hampered genetic research within the family Acipenseridae. In this study, primers were developed for 108 new microsatellite loci from a shovelnose sturgeon ""Scaphirhyncus platorhyncus"" microsatellite-​enriched subgenomic library. These primers were tested for amplification efficiency with shovelnose sturgeon, pallid sturgeon ""S. albus,"" white sturgeon ""Acipenser transmontanus,"" lake sturgeon ""A. fulvescens,"" and green sturgeon ""A. medirostris."" The results of this study will prove useful in a variety of future sturgeon genetic studies, ranging from stock assessment to mapping of quantitative trait loci."
