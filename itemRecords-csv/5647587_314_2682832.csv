10,Abstract:,"In this study, satellite data were used to determine the large- and mesoscale sea surface temperature structure of the California Current System off Baja California and to compare this structure with that found off central and southern California. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was applied to a 4.6-year sequence of AVHRR images off Baja California centered near Punta Eugenia to examine large- and mesoscale processes in this region. The EOF results provide independent satellite-â€‹derived evidence for the existence of a transition zone off Baja California which is similar to that found off central and southern Califonia. Moreover, the agreement between satellite-based results and shipboard observations indicates that satellite data can be used successfully to study other current systems (e.g., Peru Current), where ""in situ"" observations are less abundant."
