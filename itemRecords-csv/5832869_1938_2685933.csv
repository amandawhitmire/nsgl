12,Abstract:,"This paper addresses the effects of competition and oceanographic climate across a depth gradient as they influence patterns of density, survivorship, growth and reproduction of kelp species in the Point Loma kelp forest community off San Diego, California. The authors integrate long-term descriptive and experimental data and specifically address effects of inter- and intraspecific kelp density on these parameters in different depths and years, integrating time and space with an evaluation of the roles of large-scale oceanographic processes. Results of this work show that although small-scale patterns driven by processes (competition, disturbance, dispersal) are potentially very important at larger scales, the most lasting effects result from very large-scale, low-frequency episodic changes in the oceanographic climate."
