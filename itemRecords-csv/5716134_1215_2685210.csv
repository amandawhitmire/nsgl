10,Abstract:,"Restoration research on seagrasses has focused primarily on establishment of the plants and secondarily on the functional equivalency of the habitats. The authors questioned whether transplanted seagrass beds were comparable to 'natural' beds in terms of genetic diversity and structure. They sampled ""Zostera marina"" from 12 sites in the highly urbanized area of San Diego County and from pristine sites in Baja California. Using allozyme electrophoresis​, they determined that genetic diversity was significantly reduced in transplanted eelgrass beds. They discuss several hypotheses for the reduced diversity, including transplantation protocol, small size of transplantation​s, and reduced or failed sexual reproduction."
