10,Abstract:,"Olfaction appears to be the principal sense used by migratory salmonids to identify freshwater home areas through the detection of distinct odors in the home stream. This study's objective was to determine if the proportion of chinook salmon adults returning to Mad River Hatchery (California) could be significantly increased by exposing smolts to morpholine, and later using morpholine to attract adults to the hatchery when they returned to spawn. Results showed morpholine failed to increase the chinook salmon return rate to the hatchery, probably due to incomplete imprinting. Morpholine did not affect chinook salmon survival after release, ocean catch rate, or growth."
