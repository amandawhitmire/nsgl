9,Abstract:,"There is considerable interest in interdisciplina​ry oceanographic measurements. This interest is driven in large part by the recognition that many important oceanographic problems cannot be solved without truly interdisciplina​ry data sets and modeling approaches. Some of these problems concern the upper ocean's ecology. This review emphasizes new methods and techniques which can be used to treat problems involving primary production and carbon cycling, optical variability as affected by physical processes, and the utilization of these techniques for the solution of problems involving upper ocean physics, including heating rates. A glossary of terms, definitions, and acronyms is presented for those who are not familiar with the terminology commonly used by bio-optical and physical oceanographers."
