9,Abstract:,"Three species of crabs, ""Hemigrapsus oregonensis, H. nudus,"" and ""Cancer magister"", were held in cages in Elkhorn Slough, Monterey Bay, California, to measure rates of infestation by the egg predator ""Carcinonemerte​s epialti"" and to determine whether host preference was displayed. Larval worms showed a clear preference for both species of ""Hemigrapsus"" over ""Cancer magister"". Worm larvae also selected ""H. oregonensis"" at a rate approximately twice that for ""H. nudus""."
