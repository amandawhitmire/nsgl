10,Abstract:,"Shellfish mariculture is an increasing area of interest for Californians, as project proponents up and down the state pursue permits and approvals for beginning or expanding shellfish mariculture operations. Coastal areas in Northern California are primarily being pursued for oyster farming, while offshore areas in Southern California are, for the most part, being considered for mussel farming. It is important to note that although ""shellfish"" includes a range of species such as crabs, lobsters, and shrimp, California shellfish mariculture is primarily limited to oyster, mussel, and clam cultivation. Thus, oysters, mussels, and clams are the most pertinent species to consider for California shellfish mariculture, and are the species primarily considered in this article. This article provides decision-makers with the tools to undertake an initial review of physical and environmental constraints. An initial review may determine if an area is deemed physically suitable for shellfish mariculture activities, and may take the form of a pre-feasibility study similar to the Humboldt Bay Pre-Feasibility Study, which is described in greater detail in the article."
