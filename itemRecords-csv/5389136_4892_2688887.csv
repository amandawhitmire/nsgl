8,Abstract:,"External molecular signals control critical reproductive and developmental processes in a large number of benthic marine invertebrates. Specific molecular signals and the mechanisms by which they act to control reproduction, larval settlement, attachment, and metamorphosis recently were identified for a number of benthic species. Fundamental similarities in the basic molecular architecture of inducers required for reproduction and recruitment of widely different organisms are now apparent. Genetic engineering and other techniques of modern biotechnology are being used to identify, analyze, and control further the essential molecular signals and their target receptors that regulate life cycles in the ocean. Practical applications of these findings are proving useful in the experimental analysis and control of marine fouling; in improvements in the yield and economic efficiency of aquaculture; and in benthic marine resource ecology, conservation, and reseeding."
