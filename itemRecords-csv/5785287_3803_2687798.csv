13,Abstract:,"This paper discusses some of the initial steps in realizing the potential of biomineralizati​on as a route to new high- performance composite materials. Ordered microlaminate and multiphasic composites are produced ""in vitro"" utilizing. The molecular mechanisms that direct formation of the mineralized composites of the molluscan shell and flat pearl."
