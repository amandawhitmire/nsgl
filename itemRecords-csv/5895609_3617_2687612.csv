9,Abstract:,"The bacteria ""Vibrio vulnificus"" is a naturally occurring organism in estuarine waters and is found in an unknown proportion of eastern oysters, ""Crassostrea virginica,"" harvested from the Gulf of Mexico. Every year, more than 50 people become ill and at least 10 die after eating uncooked Gulf Coast oysters that are contaminated with ""Vibrio vulnificus"". Most of these illnesses and deaths occur in summer. California, in response to this health concern, initiated a program which required anyone selling Gulf oysters to notify potential consumers that the ""consumption of raw oysters can cause illness and death"". In a further step to promote public safety, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated a ""public awareness campaign"" to notify and educate those people at risk, and, initially, had proposed a seasonal ban on harvesting. The primary goal of this paper is to examine the extent to which the demand for Gulf oysters has been reduced as a result of the mandatory warning labels and associated media attention and to examine the impact on consumer welfare associated with further regulation of the harvesting sector. A model was developed and analyzed to examine the impact of mandatory warning labels and the associated negative publicity on dockside price of Gulf oysters. Results suggest that prices have fallen 30% to 50%. The loss in producer welfare associated with the proposed ban, is estimated to be just a small fraction of the revenues generated during the April through October period. This fraction and the $6,500,000 loss in consumer welfare is considerably less than the $40-80 million annual benefits that would be forthcoming as a result of the ban. Hence, one could conclude that the welfare of society would be enhanced if the eating of the raw Gulf oysters were seasonally restricted."
