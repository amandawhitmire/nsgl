10,Abstract:,"Vanadium-​containing bromoperoxidase​s (V-BrPO) are unique enzymes isolated primarily from marine algae. Halogenated natural products are abundant in marine organisms, and the biosyntheses of these products are thought to be mediated by haloperoxidases​. The role of haloperoxidase in direct halogenation or in production of diffusible oxidized bromine species (HOBr, Br2, Br3-) is a topic of much current interest. Reported here is the first evidence that V-BrPO can bind certain organic substrates (i.e., indoles) and that the active brominating moiety under these conditions is not one of the aforementioned enzyme-released bromine species."
