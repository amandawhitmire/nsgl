10,Abstract:,"The goal of the research presented here is to investigate the unsteady flow over an uneven bottom resulting in a waterfall at its terminus. Such a flow might arise from a stream with waves approaching the waterfall or even from an earthquake causing an uplift of the stream bottom near the waterfall. This flow itself is clearly not of immediate practical significance, but it is related in a way to the flow in a plunging breaking wave. The model chosen for this study, the Green-Naghdi (GN) method of fluid sheets, always yields a three-â€‹dimensional, unsteady model for such flows. The GN aproach is a continuum model in which the kinematic character of the flow is prescribed in the vertical direction. With this restriction, the equations for modeling the flow satisfy the boundary conditions exactly, satisfy conservation of mass and momentum exactly and are Gallilean invariant."
