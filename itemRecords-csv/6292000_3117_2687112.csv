10,Abstract:,"This project seeks to characterize the structure and chemistry of siderophores produced by bacteria associated with bloom-forming dinoflagellates​. (Dinoflagellate​s are a type of algae that swimby whipping tail-like structures known as flagella.) Results illuminate the processes and conditions that may precondition areas for certain kinds of sudden, heavy algal growth and can be used to improve HAB forecasts."
