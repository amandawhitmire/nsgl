17,Abstract:,"Three new cyclic heptapeptides, cyclomarins A, B, and C, were isolated from extracts of a cultured marine bacterium collected in the vicinity of San Diego, California. The major metabolite, cyclomarin A, contains three common and four unusual (or unique) amino acids. The structures of the new metabolites were determined using NMR, and the stereochemistry was determined from an X-ray crystal structure of a diacetate derivative. Cyclomarin A showed significant topical anti-​inflammatory activity in a phorbol ester (PMA)-induced mouse ear edema assay, and also showed promising in vivo activity."
