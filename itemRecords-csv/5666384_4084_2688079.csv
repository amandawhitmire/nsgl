10,Abstract:,"A growing number of diterpenes have been isolated from sponges of the orders Dendroceratida and Dictyoceratida. In addition, the isolation of norrisolide and other rearranged spongian metabolites from spongivorous nudibranchs of the genus ""Chromodoris"" implies additonal but as yet undiscovered sponge sources of these diterpenes. The recent X-ray structural elucidation of lactone 1 from the Caribbean sponge ""Igernella notabilis"" prompts us to report the isolation of the corresponding 6alpha-hydroxy derivative 2 from an Australian ""Aplysilla sp.""."
