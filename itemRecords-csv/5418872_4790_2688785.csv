8,Abstract:,The general problem of a two-dimensional water-solid impact is considered; matched asymptotic expansions are used to solve the resulting boundary value problem for small penetration depth. The first-order solution extends the classical Von Karman and Wagner theories to non-normal impact and initially curved free surfaces. It accounts for nonlinear features such as the creation of a jet at each water line. Application of the method to the computation of the impact loads exerted by spilling breakers on a marine structure is discussed.
