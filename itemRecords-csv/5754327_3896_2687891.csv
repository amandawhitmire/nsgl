10,Abstract:,"Although advances in NMR technology have greatly simplified the structural elucidation of natural products, it is still difficult to determine the stereochemistry of certain classes of compounds. Foremost among these problems is the determination of the absolute configuration at centers where an alkyl group is attached to a longer alkyl chain. This paper presents a solution to this problem which can be applied in situations where the alkyl group is allylic. The absolute stereochemistry of methyl ester 2, which is a major metabolite of the Caribbean sponge ""Plakortis halichondrioide​s"", was determined to be 6R, 8R by means of chemical degradation and application of a modification of Mosher's method."
