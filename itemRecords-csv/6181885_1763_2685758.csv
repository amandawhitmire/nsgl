9,Abstract:,"The goal of this research was to characterize the shelter preferences, home ranges, site fidelity and movement patterns of spiny lobsters in the Point Loma kelp beds in San Diego. Biologists examined changes in these behaviors for lobsters placed in shelters with and without conspecifics (other lobsters). They also compared movement patterns for lobsters living in areas with relatively low and high risk of predation by large fishes such as sheephead, black sea bass and kelp bass. This project provides important information for implementation of the Marine Life Protection Act in Southern California, such as the home ranges of exploited mobile invertebrate species like spiny lobsters and baseline information on the abundance, size frequency, population structure and location of nearshore invertebrates. About 500,000 pounds of lobster, worth an estimated $5 million, are landed in San Diego County yearly; much of this comes from the Point Loma kelp beds."
