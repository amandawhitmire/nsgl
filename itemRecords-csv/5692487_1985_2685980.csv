10,Abstract:,"The Tijuana River Watershed Management Project covers a 1,735 square mile drainage basin that straddles the California-Baja California section of the United States- Mexico border. The Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve encompasses nearly 2,500 acres of the last remaining functioning wetlands in southern California. The binational nature of the watershed provides numerous challenges and opportunities for the application of a GIS for basin-wide policy development and resource management. The GIS will be used to study a wide range of subjects such as environmental impacts of land use activities and alternatives for more efficiently managing transborder systems. In order to assist researchers in shaping the development of the GIS, a workshop was held; this report comprises the workshop results and recommendations​, and includes minutes of the project team and advisory committee meeting following the workshop."
