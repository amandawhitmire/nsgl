10,Abstract:,"A collaborative research and outreach program on oyster postharvest processing wasjointly undertaken by the Mississippi State University-​Coastal Research and Extension Center and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources-​Seafood Technology Bureau. The goal of this program was to evaluate the consumer acceptability of postharvest processed (PHP) raw oyster products and determine the economic viability of these systems for raw oyster products which would be in compliance with proposed federal regulations and satisfy market constraints imposed by individual states. Federal regulatory mandates and market constraints set up by individual states would eventually require that a significant portion of raw oyster production in the Gulf of Mexico states would undergo postharvest processing, especially during summer months. The state of California imposed a ban on the sale of untreated raw oysters from the Gulf of Mexico states during summer months starting spring 2003. Earlier federal mandates require that individual oyster producing states establish postharvest processing capacity in relation to reported Vibrio related cases. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed new regulations that would require Gulf of Mexico oysters to undergo postharvest processing during warmer months. Twelve commercial raw oyster postharvest processing plants operating in the United States are located in the Gulf of Mexico states. The three alternative postharvest processing systems that are commercially available include heat-cool pasteurization, high hydrostatic pressure and individually quick freezing oyster postharvest processing systems. In June 2009, the Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services licensed Food Technology Services Incorporated in Mulberry, Florida, to use low-dose irradiation to produce safer raw oyster products. These PHP technologies significantly reduce levels of certain bacteria that naturally occur in waters where oysters are found, provide quality raw oysters, and enhance the shelf life of raw oysters.The overall goal of this paper is to provide economic benchmarks for commercially viable postharvest processing systems for raw oyster products in the Gulf of Mexico. It is expected that these economic benchmark models would provide economic guidelines to oyster processors, distributors, and researchers in developing and promoting postharvest processed raw oyster products from the Gulf of Mexico states. Using the benchmark economic models, this paper would then assess the combined PHP capacity of the processing sector in the GOM states in relation to the recent monthly oyster landings of the region. The expansion in the regional, statewide or individual plant PHP capacity to comply with the proposed federal regulation and market constraint would have serious compliance, economic and marketing implications. This paper would attempt to outline the implications associated with the expansion of PHP capacity in the region."
