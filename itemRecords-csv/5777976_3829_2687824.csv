9,Abstract:,"Biological invasions are a major global environmental and economic problem. Analysis of California's San Francisco bay and delta ecosystems revealed a large number of exotic species that dominate many habitats in terms of number of species, number of individuals and biomass, and a high acceleration rate of invasion. These factors suggest this may be the most invaded estuary in the world. Possible causes include a large number and variety of transport vectors, a depauperate native biota, and extensive natural and anthropogenic disturbance."
