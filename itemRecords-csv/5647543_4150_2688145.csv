10,Abstract:,"High rates of mortality in fish during harvest or stocking into the natural environment have been attributed to stress caused by several factors among which are capture, net confinement, and crowding. These activities have been demonstrated to cause acute stress in young-​of-​the-​year striped bass, ""Morone saxatilis"", resulting in endocrinologica​l changes, hyperlacticemia​, and osmotic imbalance. It is demonstrated here that exercise conditioning at 1.2-2.4 body lengths s-1 for 60 d significantly improved physiological responses to and decreased recovery time from capture, net confinement, and crowding (collectively, ""handling"") stress in cultured and wild young-​of-​the-​year striped bass, ""Morone saxatilis"". Exercise conditioning was achieved by using submersible pumps to control water velocity in fish confining raceways."
