10,Abstract:,"The authors previously reported a chemical investigation of the Palauan sponge ""Dendrilla"" sp., in which the structures of three rearranged spongian diterpenes, dendrillolides A-C, were elucidated by interpretation of spectral data and by applic ation of a biosynthetic hypothesis. Subsequent studies revealed that the structure reported for dendrillolide A was incorrect and that the structure assigned to dendrillolide B was also suspect. In this paper they report that the correct structure of dendrillolide A is that previously assigned to dendrillolide B and that the structure of dendrillolide B is unknown. In addition, four new diterpenes are reported."
