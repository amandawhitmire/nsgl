9,Abstract:,"A parasitic castrator eliminates the future reproduction of its host. In this sense, being castrated by a parasite is much the same as being eaten by a predator. Parasitic castration is common among gastropod, crustacean, and echinoderm hosts. With behavioral, physiological, and morphological adaptations, hosts can avoid infection, minimize pathology or kill parasites. Alternatively, hosts can increase the chance that they will reproduce before castration by adjusting their life-history strategies. This study investigated life-history and parasitism in the salt marsh snail, ""Cerithidea californica"". After accounting for environmental variation, there was a negative association between the maturation size of snails and the prevalence of parasitic castration by larval trematodes. As predicted by life-history theory, this may represent an adaptation against parasitism that is similar to previous observations of life-history adaptations in species subject to predation or disturbance."
