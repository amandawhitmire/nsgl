10,Abstract:,"It is often remarked that the significance of the Rio meetings rests largely in the fact that they became the source of some important principles of 'soft law', advancing aspirational norms for the international legal order but not providing the kind of clear, reliable rules that could fairly be termed 'hard law' in vital areas of environmental concern. The Convention on Biological Diversity, often called simply the Biodiversity Convention, has been criticized on this ground. Difficult unresolved questions remain as to how the Biodiversity Convention's objectives can be most effectively pursued in regard to marine resources, as opposed to terrestrial resources, in light of special characteristics and challenges associated with the ocean sphere. This chapter broadly describes the Biodiversity Convention and its place in the larger history of environmental agreements and evolving principles of international law during the last half century. Attention is given to some of its specific provisions and to implementation issues. The focus then shifts to the specific question of how the Biodiversity Convention and other international agreements deal with the problems of access to (and commercial exploitation of the genetic resources of the deep sea area. How intellectual property law bears on this question is a central problem given consideration. In conclusion, the chapter will provide a very brief overview and discussion of the various proposals for institutional design that some major commentators have suggested for addressing the major problems that the Biodiversity Convention leaves unresolved."
