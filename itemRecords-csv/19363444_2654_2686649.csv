15,Abstract:,"Persistent and emerging social and environmental issues require new approaches and tools to help develop policies that address the complexities inherent in these problems. Here a policy informatics tool, developed iteratively with the feedback of ocean and coastal domain experts, is presented. The tool relies on two user inputs: a conceptually modelled ecosystem and a compilation of policy documents that covers a given jurisdiction of interest. With these inputs the user can explore what ecosystem components and linkages are potentially acknowledged in policy and which are not. The linkage acknowledgement is based on a co-occurrence of key terms. When viewing highly complex ecosystems (or other systems), the tool offers an efficient way to systematically identify potential gaps in policy and where relevant policies do exist that could be leveraged to cover emerging environmental issues. While the tool is simple in its design, the development with the potential user-community (policy makers, government staff, and ecosystem scientists) demonstrates the usefulness even in such a modest form and the desire for creative, but transparent and accessible, policy analytic tools."
