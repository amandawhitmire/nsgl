9,Abstract:,"Seawater contains about ten times more reduced carbon in solution than in particulate form. This observation has led to the compelling suggestion that aquatic animals acquire nutrients through direct absorption of dissolved organic material (DOM) into the integument. Though first discussed in the early 1860s in the reports of the RV ""Challenger"" expedition, renewed interest in this area has followed on the heels of recent technical innovations that have permitted the careful study of several aspects of such a mechanism. This paper provides a brief review of the general features of integumental nutrient transport and a more detailed discussion of the current understanding of the adaptational strategies of this process and the role of DOM uptake in the nutrition of aquatic animals."
