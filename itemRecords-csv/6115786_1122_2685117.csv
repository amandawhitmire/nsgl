12,Abstract:,"We compiled information on population size, diet composition, field metabolic rate, prey energy densities, and assimilation efficiency from the literature to estimate annual prey consumption by Common Murres (Uria aalge), between Cape Blanco, Oregon, U.S.A. and Point Conception, California, U.S.A. We estimated that the population consumed 172 313 tonnes of prey based on population estimates and diet data from the mid- to late 1980s, including 50 125 tonnes consumed by breeding adults, 36 940 tonnes consumed by non-breeding birds during the breeding season, 85 098 tonnes consumed by all birds during the wintering period, and 150 tonnes consumed by dependent chicks prior to leaving breeding colonies. We estimated that the population in the mid- 2000s consumed 225 235 tonnes of prey based on population estimates from 2004, including 65 516 tonnes consumed by breeding adults, 48 283 tonnes consumed by non-breeding birds during the breeding season, 111 226 tonnes consumed by all birds during the wintering period, and 210 tonnes consumed by chicks at breeding colonies. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the coefficients of variation around our overall prey consumption estimates were � 14.4% for the 1980s estimate and � 13.2% for the 2000s estimate."
