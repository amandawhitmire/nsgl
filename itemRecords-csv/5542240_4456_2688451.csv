9,Abstract:,"In teleost fishes the chloride cell is primarily responsible for net ion secretion in seawater. In this study, the in-vitro development of the seawater form of the chloride cell (in opercular membranes from freshwater tilapia) is examined in the presence and absence of cortisol. A mitochondrial stain was used to quantify chloride cell size and number. A fluorescent analogue of ouabain was used to localize changes in Na+-K+-ATPase and to complement biochemical measurement of its activity in the opercular membrane. Finally, development of the tubular system and cell height of chloride cells were examined. Results indicate that cortisol directly stimulates the differentiation of seawater chloride cells."
