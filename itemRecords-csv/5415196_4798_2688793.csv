12,Abstract:,"The five herpesviruses isolated from salmonid fishes were compared for their serological relatedness by serum cross-â€‹neutralization studies with polyclonal rabbit serum. They fell into two major groups. The three viruses from fishes in Japan, ""Oncorhynchus masou"" virus, yamame tumor virus, and nerka virus were closely related. They, however, differed considerably from two viruses from salmonid fishes in North American, ""Herpesvirus salmonis,"" and the steelhead herpesvirus; the latter two viruses were also closely related. This study indicated that the viruses in the two countries are serologically distinct and are not a result of transfers of infected fish or eggs between communities."
