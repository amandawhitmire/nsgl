9,Abstract:,"Thyroid hormones are involved in the regulation of the adrenal cortex in various mammals and in chickens, and there is some evidence for a regulatory role of thyroid hormones on the anuran (frog) interrenal during metamorphosis. This study reports the effects of short-term thyroxine treatment of coho salmon at two different stages of development on the subsequent response of the interrenal to ACTH (adrenocorticot​ropic hormone) in-vitro."
