12,Abstract:,"Vertebral centra from the Japanese smoothhound, ""Mustelus manazo"", collected off Nagasaki in southern Japan and from Choshi in the north, were used in a cross-exchange and comparative reading study among three laboratories (two in Japan and one in the U.S.) to determine if real differences occurred in the growth rates of these two populations. Generally, band counts were similar among techniques and laboratories, but the counts of the U.S. researchers were slightly higher owing to differences in interpretation and criteria of growth zones. Because of relatively low precision and percent agreement, and relatively high variability in size at age, the growth characteristics of the two populations of ""M. manazo"" cannot be distinguished statistically."
