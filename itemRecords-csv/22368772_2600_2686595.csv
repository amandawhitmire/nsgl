14,Abstract:,"Hydrodynamics play a critical role in mediating biological and ecological processes and can have major impactson the distribution of habitat-forming species. Low-inflow estuaries are widespread in arid regions and duringthe dry season in Mediterranean climates. There is a growing need to evaluate dynamics and exchange processesin these systems and the resultant ecological linkages. We investigate the role that hydrodynamics play inshaping environmental gradients in a short and seasonally low-inflow estuary located along the centralCaliforn​ia coast. Since 2007, eelgrass meadows in Morro Bay have declined by more than 90%, representing thecollapse of the major biogenic habitat. Despite the large-scale decline, eelgrass beds near the mouth of the bayremain resilient, suggesting that conditions in certain areas of the bay might allow or impede eelgrass retentionand recovery. Oceanographic moorings were deployed throughout the bay during the summer dry season toassess spatial differences in environmental conditions and hydrodynamics across gradients in eelgrass survival.Relati​ve to the mouth of the bay, the back bay water mass was significantly warmer (hyperthermal), more saline(hypersal​ine), less oxygenated, and more turbid, with longer flushing times, all of which have been identified assignificant stressors on seagrasses. Moreover, there is weak exchange between the mouth and the back bay thateffectively decouples the two water masses during most periods. Though the causes of the decline are not clear,gradients in environmental conditions driven by bay hydrodynamics appear to be preventing eelgrass recoveryand restoration attempts in the back bay and keeping this region in an alternative state dominated by unvegetatedinte​rtidal mudflats. Ecosystems in low-inflow estuaries may be especially prone to ecological regimeshifts or collapse and may require precautionary monitoring and management. This system and the dramaticecologi​cal change that it has experienced, demonstrate the critical role that hydrodynamics play in ecosystemhealth and habitat suitability."
