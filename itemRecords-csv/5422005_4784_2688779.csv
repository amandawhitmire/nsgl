11,Abstract:,"Commonly used approaches to investigating chemical structure of marine algal polysaccharides provide important information on the composition and conformation of populations of variable polymer molecules in extracts. They do not, however, have the sensitivity needed to study minor components, and cannot be applied to ""in situ"" identification of components. Many of these problems are overcome by two types of molecular markers for algal polysaccharides​, monoclonal antibodies and carbohydrate hybridization probes; preparation and applications are described here."
