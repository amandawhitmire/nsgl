10,Abstract:,"A technique has been developed for artificially inseminating freshly molted female lobsters (""Homarus""). At least 49.5% of the inseminated females extruded fertilized eggs; 62% of the fertilized eggs developed to the eyespot stage, and 26.6% of these subsequently hatched. Eggs were not fertilized in 7.7% of the extrusions. In 42% of the samples, it was not possible to establish whether fertilization had occurred; it is probable that many of the eggs that were evaluated as equivocal were also fertilized. This technique should be valuable in the experimental and commercial aquaculture of lobsters and might be directly applicable to other crustaceans."
