15,Abstract:,"The coordination of iron(III) to the marine amphiphilic marinobactin and aquachelin siderophores, as well as to petrobactin, an unusual 3,4-​dihydroxybenzoy​l siderophore is reported. Potentiometric titrations were performed on the apo siderophore to determine the ligand pKa values, as well as the complex formed with addition of 1 equiv of Fe(III). The log KML values for Fe(III)-​marinobactin-​E and Fe(III)-​aquachelin-​C are 31.80 and 31.4, respectively, consistent with the similar coordination environment in each complex, while log KML for Fe(III)-​petrobactin is estimated to be about 43. The pKa of the β-​hydroxyaspartyl hydroxyl group was determined to be 10.8 by 1H NMR titration. 13C NMR and IR spectroscopy were used to investigate Ga(III) coordination to the marinobactins. The coordination-​induced shifts (CIS) in the 13C NMR spectrum of Ga(III)-​marinobactin-​C compared to apo-​marinobactin-​C indicates that the hydroxamate groups are coordinated to Ga(III); however, the lack of CISs for the carbons of the β-​hydroxyamide group suggests this moiety is not coordinated in the Ga(III) complex. Differences in the IR spectrum of Ga(III)-​marinobactin-​C and Fe(III)-​marinobactin-​C in the 1600-1700 cm-1 region also corroborates Fe(III) is coordinated to the β-​hydroxyamide moiety, whereas Ga(III) is not coordinated."
