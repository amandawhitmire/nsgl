11,Abstract:,"Vanadium bromoperoxidase was discovered in the early 1980s in the marine brown alga, ""Ascophyllum nodosum""; since then, vanadium bromoperoxidase has been discovered in many other species of marine brown and red seaweeds and a lichen. Organisms may use such halogenated compounds in a chemical defense-type capacity. The stability of vanadium bromoperoxidase has been investigated under a variety of conditions. Reported here are the effects of strong oxidants as well as the effect of phosphate on the bromoperoxidase activity of V-BrPO."
