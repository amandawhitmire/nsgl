9,Abstract:,"The geographic scope of this project encompasses two estuarine systems on the North Coast of California: Humboldt Bay and, ten miles to the south, the Eel River Estuary. Humboldt Bay is a shallow water estuary linked to the Pacific Ocean by a narrow entrance channel. It is one of California's largest estuarine systems, second only to San Francisco Bay, though it is 1/20th the size of San Francisco Bay; 479 mi2 [1240 km2] vs 25 mi2 [64 km2] (Nichols and Pamatmat 1988, Barnhart et al. 1992). Humboldt Bay is dominated by marine influences, with relatively little freshwater inflow. At low tide, extensive intertidal mudflats are exposed, comprising about two thirds of the bay's total area and contributing to substantial tidal exchange with the ocean. The Eel River Estuary is the fourth largest estuary in California, but is only approximately 1/7th the size of Humboldt Bay. Tidal influence extends upstream approximately 7 mi (11.3 km) inland. The Eel River estuary has a much larger freshwater influence than Humboldt Bay, a smaller tidal prism, and greater seasonal variability in water temperature and salinity. Like other estuaries on the west coast of North America, both are geologically young and small with relatively steep terrain nearby which limits their size (Hickey and Banas 2003)."
