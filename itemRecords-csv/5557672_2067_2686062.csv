9,Abstract:,"The southern California coast is rich in species that are habitat-â€‹dependent. Despite laws that protect wetlands and endangered species, regulatory agencies still permit habitat alterations if mitigation plans promise compensation. Although the emerging policy of no net loss seeks to maintain both habitat area and functioning, even mitigation projects with the highest standards do not fulfill such goals. One five-year old salt marsh adjacent to San Diego Bay was constructed as habitat for an endangered bird, but it lacks that species and is deficient in food chain support, plant productivity, and nutrient supply functions. It should be possible to accelerate development of these ecosystem processes, using scientific knowledge and experimentation at existing mitigation projects. Meanwhile, if biodiversity is to be protected, mitigation policies must be put on hold until constructed wetlands are proved capable of attracting and sustaining the full complement of native species."
