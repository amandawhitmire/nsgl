12,Abstract:,"The possible role of growth hormone in regulating striped bass insulin-​like-​growth-​factor-​binding protein (sbIGFBP) was examined in hypophysectomiz​ed, sham-operated, and intact striped bass. The presence of sbIGFBPs in striped bass serum and their responses to hypophysectomy and subsequent heterologous growth hormone replacement suggest evolutionary conservation of the growth hormone-​insulin-​like growth factor-IGFBP axis."
