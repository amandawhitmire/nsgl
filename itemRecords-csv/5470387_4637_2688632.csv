13,Abstract:,"The authors followed the plasma thyroxine (T4) pattern of one- and two-year Atlantic salmon in Ireland in two consecutive years and have attempted to correlate these T4 patterns with rainfall, water flow and water temperature, in addition to the lunar cycle. In June of both years, an increase in plasma T4 in both year-class fish occurred as water temperature increased. No significant difference was found in triiodothyroninâ€‹e between the year-classes or within each year-class during the smoltification process."
