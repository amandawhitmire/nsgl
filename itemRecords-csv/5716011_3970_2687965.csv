10,Abstract:,"The authors revised the Minta and Mangel (1989) population estimate to correct for observation error in resighting animals and affirm that the known population lies within the new confidence interval. Since this method requires that census-takers estimate the proportion of animals present that they observe, the authors describe a method for computing the observation probability from resight data collected simultaneously by two census-takers. Finally, they evaluate how error in the estimate of observation probability affects confidence interval coverage."
