9,Abstract:,"The erosion of beaches by storm waves along the coast of California has caused much concern for property owners, resource managers, coastal engineers, and recreational users Paradoxically, these same storms generate large amounts of runoff for coastal watersheds, which results in large discharges of water and sediment to the sea. Coarse sediment (the sizes that accumulate on beaches) delivery by these coastal streams is almost non-existent except during these large storm flows. The primary objective of this article is to report research findings concerning coarse sediment delivery rates and river mouth processes along the coast of southern California."
