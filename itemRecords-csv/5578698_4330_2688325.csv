11,Abstract:,"Brown algae of the genus ""Dictyota"" contain diterpenes with a broad range of carbon skeletons. A diverse array of structural types, including dolabellanes, dolastanes and a new tricyclic diterpene dictyoxetane, have been isolated from Indian Ocean ""Dictyota"" species. An Indian Ocean specimen of ""Dictyota divaricata"" contains divarinone, which is the first example of a new class of diterpene having a novel tricarbocyclic skeleton."
