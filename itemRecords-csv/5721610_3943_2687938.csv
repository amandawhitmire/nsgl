11,Abstract:,"The basis of the irreversible inactivation of the vanadium bromoperoxidase (V-BrPO) isolated from the marine alga ""Ascophyllum nodosum"" under turnover conditions at low pH has been investigated. Inactivation under these conditions was found to produce 2-oxohistidine as identified by HPLC using electrochemical detection. Formation of 2-oxohistidine as identified by HPLC using electrochemical detectin. Formation of 2-oxohistidine requires all the components of turnover (i.e. bromide, hydrogen peroxide, and V-BrPO) as well as low pH; inactivation does not occur nor is significant 2-oxohistidine formed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide alone. The oxidation of histidine in V- BrPO is proposed to occur via oxidized bromine species. Irreversible inactivation V-BrPO was also found to be accompanied by release of vanadium."
