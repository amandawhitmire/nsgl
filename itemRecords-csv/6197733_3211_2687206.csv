It delves into the delicate balance between humans and nature in an urbanized ecosystem, demonstrating the importance of environmental awareness and action, and the role individuals can play to benefit their city and planet. It examines San Diego Bay's current state, outlines the reasons behind its decline, and offers solutions for its recovery. With a preface by Jane Goodall, a wealth of photographs, plus interviews with local experts on indigenous species and environmental concerns, this is a compelling and insightful work."
