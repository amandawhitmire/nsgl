9,Abstract:,"The hypothesis that ""Typha domingensis"" (cattail) can invade tidal marshes only after soil salinities are substantially reduced was tested experimentally. Germination rates for four southern California populations reached 100% in fresh water, decreasing to 2% at 20 ppt salinity. Rhizome-bearing plants had greatly decreased growth at 10 ppt and no growth at 25 ppt; however, rhizomes of about 5% of the plants survived 9 months at 45 ppt. The seeds and seedlings are salt sensitive, which explains why invasion into tidal marshes is restricted to prolonged periods of low soil salinity. The older, rhizome-bearing plants are salt tolerant, and can persist under hypersaline conditions."
