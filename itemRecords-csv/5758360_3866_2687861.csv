15,Abstract:,"This paper reports on the effects of salinity on fertilization and early development in a population of Pacific herring, ""Clupea pallasi,"" that migrate from oceanic waters into the San Francisco Bay estuary to spawn. The salinity tolerance range for fertilization in ""C. pallasi"" is described; and evidence is provided that a synergistic effect between elevated Na+ and K+ ions at elevated salinities is responsible for decreased fertilization, due to an inhibition of sperm motility; and the effects of lowered and elevated salinity on embryonic development are determined."
