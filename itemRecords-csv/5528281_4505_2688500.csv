9,Abstract:,"Seafoods, like other foods, may contain illness-causing bacteria and viruses from the marine environment, water pollution, or contamination from seafood handling. Cross-​contamination is the transfer of these bacteria and viruses to cooked `ready-to-eat' seafoods such as cooked crabmeat, cooked shrimp, smoked seafoods, and surimi-based seafood products. Recommendations for preventing cross-​contamination through good sanitation, personal hygiene, and seafood handling practices are presented in this fact sheet."
