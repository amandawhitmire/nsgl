9,Abstract:,"Extreme variability (including floods and drought) characterizes estuaries in semi-arid regions. At Tijuana Estuary, California, changes in the growth and distribution of salt marsh plants were documented by a monitoring program that began in 1979. The expansion of ""Spartina foliosa"", initiated during flooding in 1980, was reversed in 1984; the response of succulents was reciprocal. Populations of two short-lived marsh plants crashed during the hypersaline 1984 drought. At the San Diego River salt marsh, prolonged flooding due to reservoir drawdown eliminated halophytes and allowed fresh-​to-​brackish species to invade in 1980. Reestablishment of salt marsh species has been slow under the recent, more saline conditions. The causes of these vegetation dynamics are summarized in a conceptual model of community composition. Invasion and expansion of species are controlled by the annual `low-salinity gap,' which varies both in duration and degree of salinity reduction. Population declines and local extinctions are caused by hypersaline drought and prolonged inundation, to which species have differential tolerance."
