8,Abstract:,"Many coastal fills constructed of dredged and dumped sand are loose and may be susceptible to liquefaction. This paper describes a methodology for liquefaction risk analysis for such fills and uses Harbor Island, a hydraulic fill in San Diego Bay, as an example. The characteristics of the fill were analyzed and the liquefaction susceptibility of the soils was evaluated. These were then coupled with the results of a seismic exposure analysis for the site so that the probability of liquefaction could be evaluated."
