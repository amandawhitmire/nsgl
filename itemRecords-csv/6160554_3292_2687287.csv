10,Abstract:,"Copper antifouling paints are widely used to control fouling that slows sailboats and increases fuel consumption for powerboats. These pesticidal paints slowly leach copper from the hull to deter attachment and growth of fouling species. Copper, like zinc, tin, lead and mercury, is a metal and so will not break down over time. Thus, copper can accumulate in poorly flushed marina waters to levels that can harm marine life. As a result, boat owners are seeking alternative antifouling strategies that are more environmentally friendly than metals. Boat owners will find a variety of hull coatings and companion strategies in this Sampler. Information is compiled from manufacturers' data and boaters with an interest in environmentally friendly boat maintenance may find this report useful."
