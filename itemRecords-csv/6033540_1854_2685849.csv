13,Abstract:,"Salmon trolling is a hook-and-line commercial fishery that has supported ocean communities from Alaska to California for nearly a century. From its beginnings, trolling has attracted people who love their independence and aren't afraid of hard work or high seas. This 34 minute color DVD explores the history and culture of trolling through the recollections of 15 fishers. Their stories are honest, funny, and profound. Featuring scenes of contemporary fishing, historic films, photographs taken by the trollers themselves, and music by Pacific Northwest folk artists. This DVD video is a lasting memento of a colorful way of life that continues into the 21st century."
