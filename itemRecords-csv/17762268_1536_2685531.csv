8,Abstract:,"Welcome to the first (APRIL 2016) Urban Tides Community Newsletter! This winter and spring have delivered storms, high surf and tides, erosion, and flooding along our coast. We are celebrating more than 100 community scientists who have captured it all and uploaded more than 300 photos to Urban Tides: Thank You! Scientists are using these images and we have updates from two researchers below. This newsletter highlights some of the amazing photos in a video slideshow, updates from researcheers, blogs, media stories, and updates to the database. NOVEMBER 2016 issue: We are very excited to kick off this season of Urban Tides in coordination with a USGS/NASA/JPL flight collecting radar imagery over the Southern California coastline. We need volunteers to come out to the beach and take photos of king tides during the flight on the morning of November 14, 2016. This is citizen science in action! These images will provide invaluable on-the-ground comparisons with the radar imagery and be used to help calibrate sea level rise models. DECEMBER 2016 issue: We are looking forward to king tides on Dec 12-14, 2016 & Jan 10-13, 2017! Get ready to head out to your local beach, lagoon or wetland and help us document king tides next week. Follow the photo-taking guidelines and use this tide chart to find high tide heights and times for all of SoCal. Also, Check out a video slideshow highlighting some of the November 2016 images below. USC Sea Grant also shot drone footage of king tides at the Malibu Lagoon and SciFly shared some amazing aerial footage of king tides along the San Diego coast."
