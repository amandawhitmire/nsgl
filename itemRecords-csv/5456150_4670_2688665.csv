11,Abstract:,"Epizootiologicaâ€‹l studies of PKD at a hatchery in California resulted in the examination of non-salmonid fishes in the water supply as possible sources of PKX. This report describes ""Sphaerospora"" spp. parasitizing non-salmonid fish and rainbow trout, and discusses their possible relationship to PKX, the causative agent of proliferative kidney disease in salmonid fish. The similarity to previously observed developmental stages, rarity, and presence of these sphaerospores in salmonid fish from a hatchery where PKD is enzootic suggest that they are the most mature stage of the PKX myxosporidan yet observed."
