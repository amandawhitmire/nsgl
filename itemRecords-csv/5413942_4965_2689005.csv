11,Abstract:,"In this Summary we present California Sea Grant's recent contributions to research and education in the marine sciences and technology. California Sea Grant is the largest program in a national network of 29 Sea Grant programs. Because of its primary orientation to needs and opportunities in the coastal zone and the nearshore marine environment, Sea Grant has been described as the nation's coastal ocean science and technology program. In the pages that follow, we describe recent research activities (1985-86) of California Sea Grant in the areas of aquaculture, fisheries, ocean technology, coastal resources,Â new marine products, and marine affairs. The projects address a multitude of important issues: the improvement of seafood quality, the safety of offshore oil structures, the health of our fisheries, the vulnerability of coastal areas to earthquakes, the responses of wetlands to manmade hydrological changes, and the development of new industries in marine biotechnology, to choose just a few examples. Each of these research projects has survived a rigorous process of merit review. And most include graduate trainees."
