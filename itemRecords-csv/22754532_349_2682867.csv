15,Abstract:,"Seafood direct marketing (SDM) allows fishermen to sell their catch directly to consumers or via fewer intermediaries than in the dominant supply chain. In the United States of America, fishermen are drawn to SDM arrangements as a means of adapting to regulatory, operational, environmental, social and economic challenges. However, SDM is not always feasible or suitable for individuals, fisheries or communities. Recognizing this, university-​trained advisors affiliated with Sea Grant Extension Programs (SGEPs) have developed a good practice for assisting small-scale fishermen and communities in evaluating and utilizing SDM in their particular context. Guided by the SGEP model, the practice uses a science-based approach grounded in principles of non-​advocacy, trust, collaboration and effective communication. This case study describes the development and application of the good practice by SGEPs advisors in the American states of Alaska and California to help fishermen and others make well-​informed decisions about SDM. To implement use of this practice they recommend: recognizing and working with fishing community members as experts and co-educators (partners); collaborating to identify and address needs by sharing and building information; refraining from advocacy; recognizing that SDM is not an “all or nothing” strategy; developing contextually grounded outreach materials; and using multiple information delivery methods and dissemination channels. Use of the good practice consistent with these recommendations can contribute to further implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication."
