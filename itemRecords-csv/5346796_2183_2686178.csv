8,Abstract:,"Quantitative surveys of the Colorado Lagoon and Marine Stadium (Long Beach) indicated that the bivalve communities in the Lagoon and the Stadium were dramatically different, even though water exchanged freely between the two systems. In the Lagoon, bivalve populations were dominated by suspension-​feeders, while in the Stadium deposit-feeders were most abundant. This paper shows how the deposit-feeding shrimp (""Callianassa californiensis""​) controls the distribution of a suspension- feeding bivalve through turbidity. Laboratory experiments showed that ""Callianassa"" can create levels of turbidity and sediment destabilization sufficient to reduce the growth and survival of ""M. mercenaria""."
