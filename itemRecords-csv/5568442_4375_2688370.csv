12,Abstract:,"It is commonly assumed that the stress vectors that result from freezing and drying (air drying or freeze drying) of biological materials are entirely similar, but there is good evidence that the similarity between these processes is only superficial. Indeed, it appears that they involve fundamentally different stresses, requiring equally different mechanisms to obviate those stresses. Studies are reviewed, and evidence is presented to support this point of view."
