13,Abstract:,"Using a flow-through chamber, red abalones (""Haliotis rufescens"") were exposed to ambient, hyposaline, or hypersaline seawater, with and without a sublethal concentration of pentachlorophen​ol (PCP). They were then maintained in clean seawater to check both rate and degree of recovery. Phosphagen changes in foot muscles were monitored by surface-probe localized NMR. Upon PCP exposure phosphoarginine levels declined, inorganic monophosphate levels increased, and intracellular pH decreased. Whereas during recovery all biochemical endpoints returned to normal, both onset and intensity of effects were significantly influenced by changes in seawater salinity. Application of 31-P NMR represents a powerful new tool for elucidating the influence of natural stress factors on pollutant action ""in vivo,"" providing a more accurate assessment of environmental effects."
