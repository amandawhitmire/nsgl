11,Abstract:,"At present, rock crabs are exploited in California with no restrictions on sex or reproductive condition; ovigerous and nonovigerous females are both removed by the fishery. This study investigated fecundity and aspects ot the reproductive biology of ""Cancer anthonyi"" as part of a larger study that examined brood mortality resulting from nemertean predation. Observations on multiple broods per crab and interbrood periods are reported, and an analysis of crab fecundity in relation to size, embryogenesis, and seasonality is presented. Reproductive potential is defined in terms of the maximum lifetime fecundity of an individual crab, and reproductive potential within the genus is compared."
