20,Abstract:,"In August 2004 a unique cabled observatory was deployed to study the physical and biogeochemical characteristics of the south shore of Oahu, Hawaii. A cable linked to shore provides power and high-bandwidth data communications to an array of instruments approximately 500m offshore at a depth of 10m. Cabling the observatory allows for data collection free from the power and memory constraints of traditional autonomous sampling methods, and provides the opportunity for 1) adaptive sampling based on study goals and developing local conditions and 2) shore-​controlled manipulative experiments. A second generation of the observatory is currently under development and will be deployed in Fall 2006. As part of this expansion, a thermistor chain array, water chemistry profiler, dissolved nutrient analyzer, spectrophotomet​ric pH sensor and dissolved oxygen sensors will be added to the observatory, while the use of ADCP, ADV and YSI multi-parameter sonde data will continue on a larger scale. Shipboard CTD and water chemistry profiles in conjunction with REMUS AUV surveys add a spatial component to augment the time-series data being collected from the cabled instruments. The Kilo Nalu observatory provides data for multiple studies, emphasizing internal tide structure and O2 fluxes through sandy sediments. Additionally, the observatory acts as an important public resource, providing web accessible, near real-time wave, current, and water quality data. Preliminary data from this recently expanded, integrative instrument array will be presented."
