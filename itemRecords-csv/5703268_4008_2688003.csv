12,Abstract:,"Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are produced and secreted by liver and other organs. IGFs play important roles in the development of embroys and neonates and postnatal growth in mammals. The presence of specific carrier proteins, IGF- binding proteins, was proposed to explain an apparent contradiction in the molecular weight of substances with IGF activity in whole serum, where activity was associated with an entity of greater that 60 kDa in molecular weight compared with 7.5 kDa for purified IGF. This study examined the regulation of secretion of two IGF binding proteins by the liver of the striped bass by hormones and growth factors ""in vitro""."
