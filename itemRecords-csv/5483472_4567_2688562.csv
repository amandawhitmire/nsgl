8,Abstract:,"A previous study showed that sturgeon fed a diet containing 8% refined-soy lecithin (PL) grew better than those fed a similar diet with PL replaced by an equal amount of an oil mixture, suggesting that lecithin was required by sturgeon. Careful examination of the diet formulation, however, revealed that the vitamin premix contained no choline supplement. A subsequent study showed that sturgeon fed a similar diet without either PL or choline chloride (CH) supplements had a significantly lower percent body weight increase and a higher feed/gain ratio than those fed diets with PL, CH or both, suggesting that choline but not lecithin is required by sturgeon. The objectives of the present study were to (1) determine the choline requirement, and (2) confirm the non-​essentiality of PL for optimum growth of juvenile white sturgeon."
