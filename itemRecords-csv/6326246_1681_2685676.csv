9,Abstract:,"Why not reuse your household water by installing a graywater system? Graywater is the wastewater that drains out of washing machines, sinks, bathtubs and showers. It can be reused in your yard to water plants and trees. In the soil, graywater is purified naturally by microorganisms that break down organic contaminants. It can percolate deep in the ground and help recharge groundwater. In August 2009, California graywater system regulations were revised, giving homeowners the opportunity to divert washing machine graywater directly into their yards without a permit, providing a few rules are followed (see box on page 3). A family of four can potentially divert 22,000 gallons of water per year by using graywater from the laundry system alone. The average three bedroom home generates 160 gallons of graywater per day, or 58,400 gallons per year. In Southern California, where 38% of single family household water demand is used outdoors (landscape irrigation and car washing), graywater systems can save 25 to 40 percent of potable water."
