8,Abstract:,"Buying and eating local seafood is good for the environment, supports our local economy and fishermen, and is a great source for healthy, fresh food.Did you know that there are approximately 70 species landed in California throughout the year? Yet many of these locally caught species are unknown to most Californians. This site provides a guide for information on the biology, fishery, nutrition, and culinary uses of species landed or farmed in California to help consumers make informed seafood choices."
