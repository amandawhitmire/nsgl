14,Abstract:,"This report presents an overview of the work completed under WCB award WC-1663CR, from 2017-2020. The goal of this project was to support efforts to increase streamflow in tributaries to the lower Russian River that are critical to the recovery of endangered coho salmon populations, by providing recovery partners with information and tools to better understand the flow needs of salmon and limiting factors related to flow and habitat conditions. The work focused on three key tasks: 1) Develop predictive models relating streamflow, environmental metrics, and juvenile coho salmon survival; 2) Document wetted habitat conditions in Dutch Bill, Green Valley, and Mill Creeks in relation to streamflow and fish distribution, and build a predictive model for surface water recession; and 3) Organize annual coordination meetings among the many salmon recovery partners working towards common streamflow improvement goals in the watershed."
