11,Abstract:,"Aquatic invasive species (AIS) may be transported among fouling growth on hulls of boats and ships. Boats, such as commercial fishing and pleasure craft, are believed to transport AIS on their hulls between ports and smaller harbors within regions, whereas ships are believed to be responsible for most long-distance AIS transport. Once established, AIS become entrenched in the ecosystem, resisting eradication, and compromising human health and economic production that rely on the marine environment and resources. Much AIS policy and research have focused on large commercial ships and trailered boats. The role of recreational, commercial-​passenger and commercial fishing boats in transporting AIS along the California coast is poorly understood, and control programs are not tailored to their operational costs and profiles. Hull fouling control is critical for operational efficiency of vessels, as well as for reducing risks of transporting AIS. A variety of methods are used to control fouling on boats that are kept in saltwater, such as applying heavy-metal antifouling paint to the hull, periodically cleaning the hull while the boat is in the water, and surrounding the boat with a slip liner to which fresh water is added. Although an uncommon practice in California, some boats are stored out of the water on a hoist or in a boat barn when not in use. Regulatory concerns about heavy metal contamination of coastal waters have led the International Maritime Organization to initiate a phased ban of tributyl tin in antifouling paint. They have also prompted the California Regional Water Quality Control Boards (CRWQCB) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to regulate copper antifouling paint discharges from vessel hulls in southern California small craft harbors. Copper is discharged from hulls primarily via passive leaching, but also by in-water hull cleaning. The proposed National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005 encourages the avoidance of in-water hull cleaning, proper use of antifouling coatings, and collection and disposal of fouling growth. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) compromise native habitats, human health and economic production based on marine environments and resources."
