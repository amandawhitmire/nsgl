10,Abstract:,"These days, we hear all natural as it relates to so many foods. Is all natural really better ? This depends on the definition. When it comes to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the term natural applies only to a subset of flavors. Seafood is regulated by the FDA. Natural may infer quality. Natural biochemical changes to seafood post-mortem are rapid in most species and without proper controls, result in a poor quality product. The quality of the functional, moisture binding (myofibrillar) protein is usually extremely high immediately after catch. (Fish that have struggled during catch will be spent and protein quality will suffer as a consequence.) Immediately after harvest, it is very important to reduce the temperature of the fish to protect the protein from denaturing or undergoing a change in protein structure."
