13,Abstract:,"Seabirds are incidentally killed in the course of fishing operations, both in coastal areas and on the high seas in almost all gear types. Recognizing the escalation of seabird bycatch as a marine conservation and fisheries management issue, the Pacific Seabird Group helped initiate a symposium on seabird bycatch, bringing together people from various fisheries and disciplines. The purpose was to share information on techniques to quantify this bycatch and its effects, obstacles and solutions to the problem, and the development of bycatch-​specific technologies. This publication includes nine peer-reviewed papers and seven abstracts, as well as a synthesis of themes relevant to seabird bycatch, which proposes a set of guidelines to 'solve' bycatch for seabirds and other taxa."
