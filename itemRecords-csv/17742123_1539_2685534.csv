12,Abstract:,"The sandpaper skate, Bathyraja kincaidii, is commonly taken as bycatch in trawl fisheries off central California. The impact of fisheries exploitation on this population is unknown, however little is known about its biology, including its reproductive life history. To determine reproductive aspects of B. kincaidii, 506 individuals were collected from commercial trawls, museum collections, and monthly trawl and longline surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service. Males ranged from 112 to 635 mm TL, whereas females ranged from 113 to 610 mm TL. Males reach firstmaturity at 440mmTL and at ~3 years, whereas females reach first maturity at 450 mm TL, approximately 1 year later. Size and estimated age at 50 % maturity were similar between sexes: 492 mm TL and 7.5 years for males and 467 mm TL and 7.1 years for females. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) and hepatosomatic index (HSI) values indicate a continuous reproductive cycle, with a seasonal peak in the summer and fall, and a resting period following egg case deposition."
