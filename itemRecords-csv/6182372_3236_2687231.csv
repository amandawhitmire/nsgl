9,Abstract:,"On their annual northward migration, tens of thousands of brant geese descend on Humboldt Bay to feed on the long green ends of eelgrass. It might seem grazing could hurt eelgrass, which provides important vegetation and habitat for many marine species. However, this is not the case. California Sea Grant research shows that grazing by geese, at its current intensity level, stimulates eelgrass growth. ""We were concerned people might automatically assume that anything eating eel grass must be bad for eel grass,"" said botany professor Frank Shaughnessy of Humboldt State University, explaining his interest in studying the effects of geese on eelgrass ecosystems in Humboldt Bay. ""It is not true."""
