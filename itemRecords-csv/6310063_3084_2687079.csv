15,Abstract:,"The mission of the Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE) network is to engage scientists and educators to transform ocean sciences education. One role of the COSEE centers is to assist ocean scientists in developing and implementing successful broader impact statements for grant proposals. COSEE - Pacific Partnerships is a regional Center in the COSEE Network based at marine laboratories in Oregon, Washington, California, & Hawai'i. COSEE - Pacific Partnerships (COSEE - PP) is specifically focused on integrating marine research and education for audiences that historically have been underserved by the ocean sciences community. We aim to increase opportunities for community college faculty and students to connect with scientists to increase the inclusion of marine science instruction in community colleges, and to provide faculty and students with research and career exposure experiences. In addition we work with informal science education professionals to create professional development opportunities, and with volunteers to develop their expertise in ocean science content and public communications research. We are designing the COSEE - PP programs and associated products to be implementable at other marine laboratories. Specific examples of the COSEE - PP programs that scientists can partner with to meet their broader impact goals will be presented."
