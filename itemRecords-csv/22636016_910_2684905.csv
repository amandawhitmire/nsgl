15,Abstract:,"Sediment is an essential component of contemporary coastal and marine management in California. For decades, multiple coastal sediment management organizations have facilitated and coordinated regional sediment management (RSM) as an approach, and more recently, are increasingly focused on the state’s sea level rise adaptation efforts. From the perspective of representatives and members of some of these organizations, this paper describes challenges of RSM in the areas of organizational capacity and coordination. It also characterizes ways in which organizations are taking leadership and action in overcoming these constraints to fulfill their commitment to improved coastal sediment management."
