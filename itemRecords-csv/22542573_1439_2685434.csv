17,Abstract:,"Every month, small teams of Santa Barbara and Ventura area community members head to beaches up and down the coast, to carefully survey beach elevation. California Sea Grant’s Community Alliance for Surveying the Topography of Sandy Beaches (CoAST SB) project monitors beaches from Oxnard Shores in Ventura County to Isla Vista Beach in Santa Barbara. To survey the beaches, volunteers use a simple method involving two measuring sticks and a rope. The methodology designed in 1961 is still used worldwide, and provides a consistent data set that can be easily used by USGS and other professionals. ​ While the basic methodology was sound, data entry is now much easier, thanks to students from Santa Barbara High School’s Computer Science Academy. Working under the guidance of Kevin Parent (CoAST SB volunteer), Paula Cassin (SB High School Computer Science Academy Fund) and Jared Fitton (app project manager), the high school students developed a new data collection app that CoAST SB volunteers use to collect data during monthly beach profile surveys.
