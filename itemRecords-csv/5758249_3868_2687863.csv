15,Abstract:,"Leishmaniasis is a tropical disease that affects an estimated 350 million people in equatorial Asia, Africa and Central and South America. In Central and South America, the causative agent is the protozoan ""Leishmania mexicana,"" which has a reservoir in the rodent population and is transmitted by flies. The most common drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis (pentostant and glucantil) contain pentavalent antimonials that have cardiotoxic effects at the recommended doses. Alternative drugs such as amphotericin B and azoles have equally unpleasant side effects. The urgent need for alternative treatments has led to a program to screen natural products for potential use in the therapy of leishmaniasis. As part of a program to discover new drugs for the treatment of tropical diseases, the authors have isolated and identified six new metabolites from the Palauan sponge ""Plakortis aff. angulospiculatu​s"". Two cyclic peroxides show strong ""in vitro"" antiproliferati​ve effects on promastigotes of ""Leishmania mexicana""."
