15,Abstract:,"Seychelles, a group of islands in the Indian Ocean, yielded 93 sponges, 14 soft corals, 10 tunicates, 4 zoanthids, 3 hard corals, 2 algae, and an anemone in a collecting expedition. The crude methanolic extracts of 124 samples were screened against the Gram-positive bacteria ""Staphylococcus aureus"" and ""Bacillus subtilis"", the Gram negative bacteria ""Escherichia coli"" and ""Pseudomonas aeruginosa"", and the fungus ""Candida albicans"". Seven extracts were very active against all microbes; however, all of these extracts were from organisms familiar from prior studies. The bioactivity data were unexceptional but the 1H NMR spectra revealed several unusual compounds."
