11,Abstract:,"Sea anemones are marine, stenohaline animals, except for a few euryhaline species that occur exclusively in estuaries. One of these exceptions is ""Nematostella vectensis"", first described from brackish pools on the Isle of Wight off southern England. Subsequently it has been found in Nova Scotia and probably occurs in all of the contiguous coastal states of the U.S. ""Nematostella"" differs uniquely from all other sea anemones by its possession of nematosomes in its coelenteron. This unique creature's habits, occurrence, and other aspects are reviewed here."
