8,Abstract:,"Recently, the authors reported the antimicrobial properties of an extract from ""Dendrilla membranosa"", a bright yellow Antarctic sponge which may be immune to predation by nudibranchs and seastars due to the presence of defensive chemicals. The antimicrobial component was identified as 4,5,8-​trihydroxyquino​line-​2-​carboxylic acid by interpretation of spectral data and confirmed by synthesis."
