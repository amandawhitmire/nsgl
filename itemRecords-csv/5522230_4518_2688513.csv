12,Abstract:,"Generally, fish cannot utilize carbohydrate as efficiently as terrestrial animals. The objective of this present study was to examine the hepatic and intestinal histology of white sturgeon fed different carbohydrates over an 8-week period. Sturgeon fed glucose, maltose or dextrin had histologically normal livers, and significantly higher hepatosomatic indices and liver glycogen levels than fish fed the other carbohydrates. Fish fed sucrose, lactose or fructose had a moderate condensation of the hepatocyte cytoplasm and a decreased number of glycogen-​containing intracytoplasmi​c vacuoles; their distal intestines contained a significantly higher amount of luminal water, similar to that observed in higher vertebrates with diarrhea secondary to disaccharide intolerance."
