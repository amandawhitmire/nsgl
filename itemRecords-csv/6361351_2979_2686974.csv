10,Abstract:,"Salmon farming has been fraught with controversy and vilified by a number of well-funded opposition groups raising outcries over use of antibiotics, salmon escaping from farms, competition with wild fish, use of color enhancers, high levels of PCBs, disease transmission, and nutrient pollution. All of these are serious concerns and the salmon farming industry has evolved since its beginnings in the 1970s to address these issues such that today, salmon farmed in most regions of the world provide a healthy, safe and sustainable source of seafood. While there is still room for improvement, that can be said for about any agricultural endeavor and the salmon farming industry continues to explore better ways to do things."
