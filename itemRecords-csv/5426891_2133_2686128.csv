9,Abstract:,"A detailed description of incident sea conditions is an essential prerequisite to sophisticated analysis and design in the coastal and ocean environment. The established technique is the Gaussian random wave model (GRWM), represented in terms of the variance spectrum of wind wave records. There is a growing awareness, however, that the variance spectrum may incompletely represent some potentially significant aspects of surface gravity waves. Wave grouping may be one of these. Wave groups, a finite run of higher-​than-​normal waves, are often observed at sea and in wave records. It is implicit in the GRWM that the phase spectrum is completely random and includes no useful information; it is the intention of this paper to focus on the phase spectrum of surface gravity wave records, in a search for potentially ordered structure."
