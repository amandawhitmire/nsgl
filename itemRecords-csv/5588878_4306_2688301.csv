13,Abstract:,"Growth hormone (GH) stimulation of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) production by hepatic and extrahepatic tissues and stimulation of growth by IGF-I have been widely demonstrated in mammals. Here, the effect of IGF-I on growth rate of coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") was examined. The results indicate that exogenous treatment with mammalian IGF-I can stimulate coho salmon growth under some conditions, and that endogenous IGF-I may be an important factor in regulating growth of teleosts."
