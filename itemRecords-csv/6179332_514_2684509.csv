11,Abstract:,"From early spring to late summer, California grunion (Leuresthes tenuis) ride with the high tides onto the shores of Southern California to spawn. The female fish dig into the sand and deposit their eggs, while the males deposit their milt around the females to fertilize the clutches. The clutches of eggs remain out of water incubating in the sand until the next high tide, synchronized with the lunar cycle. Although there are considerable advantages to non-aqueous egg incubation, there are also potential disadvantages, one of which is possible changes in osmolarity in the surrounding medium. The effects of different salinity levels on grunion eggs during incubation were experimentally tested, by comparing the embryo survival and hatching competence of eggs incubated in sand moistened with artificial seawater of five different salinities, including normal seawater at 34 ppt, and water of 15, 24, 41, and 49 ppt. Each set of grunion eggs were tested for hatching competence in two different hatching media: normal sea water and the salinity of incubation. Grunion embryos tolerated decreased salinity better than increased salinity during incubation, and hatched at significantly lower rates when the salinity was above normal. The hatching medium did not alter hatching competence of eggs within each treatment. This study has potential implications for possible effects on grunion for implementation of desalination plants on the coast, because after desalinization, concentrated seawater is released into the ocean."
