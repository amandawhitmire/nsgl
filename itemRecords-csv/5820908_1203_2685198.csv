9,Abstract:,"Loss of wetland habitat has proceeded at an alarming rate in southern California, and increasingly marsh restoration and creation are being used to mitigate these losses. As part of an effort to evaluate functional equivalence of created systems, the ichthyofaunal assemblages in a created and adjacent natural marsh in Mission Bay, San Diego, California were compared. Species richness and dominance measures were similar between the two systems, while abundances were higher in the natural relative to the created marsh. Size-structure differed between the created and natural marsh creeks, with the created marsh populations being skewed towards larger size classes. These size differences are believed to arise from differences in creek morphology between the created and natural systems, and potentially affect both predators and prey in the marsh. Mark-​release-​recapture revealed considerable marsh fidelity. Stable isotope analyses confirmed the high marsh fidelity suggested by tagging results. This first published documentation of the Mission Bay marsh resident fishes suggests that the created marsh ichthyofaunal assemblage was distinct in density and size as structure from the adjacent natural marsh, and provides lessons for future restoration efforts."
