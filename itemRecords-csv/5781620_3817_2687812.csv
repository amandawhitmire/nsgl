12,Abstract:,"Metabolites discovered from the cultures of marine-derived fungi are either parallel or identical to those of terrestrial fungi. The authors began a study of the saltwater culture of a ""Trichoderma longibrachiatum​"" procured form a ""Haliclona"" marine sponge. Species of the genus ""Trichoderma"" are of current interest as sources of unique metabolites. The authors disclose that the saltwater culture of a sponge-derived ""T. longibrachiatum​"" produces D28 bisvertinoid polyketide accompanied by a new C14 vertinoid pigment, which they have named epoxysorbicilli​nol."
