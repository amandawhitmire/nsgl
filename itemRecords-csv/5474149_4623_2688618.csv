8,Abstract:,"In 1952, Japan, the U.S., and Canada concluded the North Pacific Fisheries Convention, an agreement on research and management of ocean fisheries that now stands out as one of the truly pivotal events in post-WWII diplomacy and ocean law. This article reappraises the origins and historical context of the convention, focusing on the `abstention principle,' under which each signatory power agreed to abstain from commercial fishing of those designated fish species that were determined scientifically to have been exploited to the point of maximum sustained yield. Its practical significance was to exclude Japan from the rich northeast Pacific fisheries for several species, including salmon. It has been maintained by some that Japan accepted this provision, seen as an elaborate rationalization of a self-interested American policy of exclusion, under duress (in exchange for restoration of Japanese sovereignty through the general Peace Treaty of 1952). This claim and its implications are examined along with the history, policy process, and principal players involved."
