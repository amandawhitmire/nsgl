14,Abstract:,"The juvenile hormones (JHs) play important roles in the regulation of insect development and reproduction. Until recently there had been no successful chemical identification of a JH in any non-insect arthropod. The authors recently identified a JH-like compound, methyl farnesoate (MF), in the hemolymph of the spider crab ""Libinia emarginata"", and identified the mandibular organ as the site of synthesis of this compound. The detection of MF in other decapods is described, and data are presented demonstrating its relationship to reproduction and larval development."
