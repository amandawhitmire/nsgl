7,Abstract:,"Ocean sewage outfalls are major sources of contaminants to coastal ocean ecosystems. This method of disposal has advantages in terms of economy and relative societal impact, but it also raises important concerns about seafood safety, public health, and ecosystem health and preservation. T​he ocean offers relatively rapid dilution of many harmful substances, but it also carries particulates bearing trace metals, bacteria, viruses, DDT and other harmful substances. What are the potential impacts of these sub stances on urban populations and on coastal ocean ecosystems? For several years, the University of Southern California Sea Grant Program has sponsored investigations of ocean processes and biology associated with the White's Point sewage outfall, the largest sewage outfall in the United States, discharging an average of 330 million gallons per day onto the Palos Verdes shelf adjacent to Santa Monica Bay. In several interdisciplina​ry research projects, Sea Grant scientists,have investigated the complex oceanographic processes affecting dispersion of the outfall plume and the resuspension of trace metals and nutrient fluxes from bottom sediments near the outfall."
