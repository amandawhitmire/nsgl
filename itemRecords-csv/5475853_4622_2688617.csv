10,Abstract:,"A workshop on sea-going experiments and long-term observations was convened as part of the RIDGE program. The goals of the workshop were (1) to involve a large segment of the scientific community in identifying experimental approaches and innovative technology relevant to the scientific objectives of RIDGE, and (2) to provide written material to aid the RIDGE steering committee in preparing an initial plan for action. The group agreed that a productive format would be for subgroups to focus on experiments concerning particular phenomena within certain spatial contexts. Each subgroup prepared a working document during the meeting; these subgroup reports constitute the core of this workshop report."
