11,Abstract:,"The apparent U.S. per-capita oyster consumption declined from about 0.35 pound during 1971-1989 to less than 0.25 pound starting in 1990. Oyster consumption may be affected by many factors: region, ethnicity, age, gender, income level, and awareness of potential risks. Results of recently conducted national surveys revealed several reasons consumers gave for not eating oyster products or not eating them more frequently. Hanson, et al. (2003) reported that taste, texture, and smell were the most widely cited reasons for not consuming oyster products. Respondents who ate oyster products considered price, product safety concerns, and lack of fresh products as the top three reasons for not eating them more frequently."
