7,Abstract:,"The impacts of mandatory catch and release fishing regulations have not been evaluated for many recreational gamefish species but are assumed to result in fish survival and recovery with minimal deleterious effects. We evaluated the short-term sublethal physiological and behavioral effects of angling stress on kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus, one of the most popular gamefish in southern California. Significantly elevated blood stress biomarkers were measured in the hour(s) following capture, and were positively correlated with angling and handling duration, but negatively correlated with fish size. Recovery occurred in <24 h and kelp bass showed no sign of cumulative or chronic stress from repeated angling events. Compared to controls, area use size was similar for angled fish, but following release feeding activity and rate of movement were reduced for 33 h and 10 h, respectively, and animals were associated more often with areas of high vertical relief."
