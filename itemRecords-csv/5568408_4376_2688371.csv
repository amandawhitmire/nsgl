10,Abstract:,"Hydroperoxides are potent initiators of lipid peroxidation in vivo. Acyl hydroperoxides may also regulate various aspects of lipid metabolism. This study investigated the regulation of the endogenous 12 lipoxygenase in trout gill and rat lung, a prominent acyl hydroperoxide catalyst in these tissues. Results suggest that the lipoxygenase enzyme in lung and gill tissue is a major potential source for acyl hydroperoxides in vivo, but is also very sensitive to oxidant stresses including the acyl hydroperoxides themselves. This enzyme could thus be an important focus for oxidant injury in lungs."
