14,Abstract:,"The Thomas Fire ignited on December 5, 2017 and burned nearly 300,000 acres of land inVentura and Santa Barbara counties until January 12, 2018, making it the largest wildfire in California history at the time. During the fire, a persistent plume of ash, smoke, and soot extended up to 1,000 km offshore over the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC). The effect of this ash influx on the SBC phytoplankton community was investigated with an Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) onboard R/V Sally Ride during a research cruise in mid-December 2017. Over 100,000 images of phytoplankton and nonliving particles were collected and each image was manually classified, resulting in time series of phytoplankton cells and detrital particles, including ash. Comparing the Thomas Fire conditions to historical monthly sampling in the SBC in December reveals significant differences in sea surface temperature, nutrient concentration, and phytoplankton community composition (PCC) in December 2017. During the ThomasFire, dinoflagellates dominated the phytoplankton community (comprising up to 90% of the total phytoplankton cell biovolume per sample), while diatoms and picophytoplankt​on typically dominate surface ocean PCC in the SBC in December. While this study was not able to demonstrate a correlational relationship between PCC and wildfire ash concentration, the significant differences in surface ocean biogeochemistry in December 2017 compared to past winters is notable. Wildfire severity and frequency are annually increasing in California and globally with unknown impacts on the marine ecosystem; thus, this study provides an important baseline assessment for the SBC."
15,,"Plain Language Summary: This work describes marine phytoplankton community composition (PCC) during a wildfire. This work was conducted as part of a previously planned cruise onboard R/V Sally Ride in December 2017, which enabled us to sample PCC in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) during the Thomas Fire. The Thomas Fire was the largest wildfire in California history at the time, although it has since been surpassed by the Mendocino Fire complex in summer 2018 and five separate wildfires in summer 2020. This work was conducted using an Imaging FlowCytobot to quantify and characterize PCC and describe ash and detrital particle concentrations during the fire. We found that the phytoplankton community during the Thomas Fire was dominated by dinoflagellates (up to 90% of biomass), while the phytoplankton community in winter in the SBC is typically composed of diatoms or picophytoplankt​on. While we are not able to show a causal relationship between the Thomas Fire and PCC with the data collected on this cruise, we use time series data to show that December 2017 was significantly different from historical winters in the SBC. Warmer sea surface temperatures and a negative North Pacific Gyre Oscillation may have contributed to conditions that were favorable for dinoflagellates​. Wildfire severity and frequency are expected to increase worldwide—this study provides a baseline for the impacts of wildfires in the SBC."
