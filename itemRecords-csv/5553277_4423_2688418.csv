13,Abstract:,"In this study, the suitability of submarine light environments in central San Francisco Bay for supporting eelgrass growth was explored with the goal of developing a predictive relationship between irradience-​saturated photosynthesis (""H""sat) availability and the depth distribution of ""Zostera marina"" in the bay. Average daily periods of in-situ ""H""sat were estimated from field observations of light attenuation measured at five existing eelgrass beds and laboratory measurements of photosynthesis. The values obtained were then compared with ""H""sat requirements for the maintenance of positive carbon balance for whole plants calculated from laboratory measurements of metabolic rates. Collectively, these relationships defined depth distribution patterns for eelgrass populations in the bay that should insure long-term survival."
