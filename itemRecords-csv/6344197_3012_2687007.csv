10,Abstract:,"Originating in Japan several centuries ago, surimi is a uniquely functional food ingredient made of stabilized fish proteins. Surimi seafood is often used as an ingredient in seafood appetizers, salads and entrees. Until the discovery of cryoprotectants (an ingredient used to protect cells or tissues from damage during freezing) in 1959-1960, fresh surimi was used for kamaboko products. (Kamaboko is the most common surimi seafood in Japan which is cooked in steam and it often represents all types of surimi seafood in Japan.) Previously, freezing surimi altered fish myofibrillar proteins and surimi was no longer able to develop gel networks."
