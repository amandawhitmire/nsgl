8,Abstract:,"Climate change is expected to have large, negative e ects on the global economy. Adaptation by individuals and rms will determine, in part, how much damage ultimately occurs. This paper introduces a method for estimating forward-​looking adaptation based on changes in expectations about the weather, provides conditions under which public forecasts provide good measures for these expectations, and formalizes identi cation of ex ante adaptation using ex post observations. To apply the method, I build a novel dataset of El Ni~no/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts and estimate adaptation by North Paci c albacore harvesters to ENSO-driven climate variation. The results show that, in this setting, nearly all of the e ect of climate variation can be controlled through adaptation. Detailed, rm-level data allows for exploration of mechanisms, showing that vessels primarily adapt by timing entry into the shery."
