10,Abstract:,"One of the most important environmental parameters controlling microbial growth in food is temperature. Studies in the past have defined the range of temperatures which permit initiation of growth and toxigenesis in culture media and foods by the various serotypes of ""Clostridium botulinum"". Methodologies which can quantify the risk of ""C. botulinum"" growth as it is affected by various parameters would provide a basis for preservation, utilizing less intensive conditions than are presently used and would assist in the establishment of realistic quality standards for ""C. botulinum"" in foods. This research deals with the development of methods which will quantify the probability of growth of ""C. botulinum"" in a model broth system as it is affected by strain, cell and serologic type, size of inoculum and temperature of incubation."
