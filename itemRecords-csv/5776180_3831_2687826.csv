11,Abstract:,"This document presents a model sanitation standard operating procedure (SSOP) for a fictional seafood company that prepares ready-to-eat shrimp. The SSOP is for illustrative purposes and, in practice, will vary because each facility and process is designed differently. Eight aspects of sanitation are examined. Recommendations as to control measures, monitoring procedures, corrective actions, and record keeping are specified, and a sample daily sanitation report is included."
