9,Abstract:,"With California Sea Grant support, biologists at the University of California and Pepperdine University have been studying wrack?s role in coastal ecosystems and the ecological consequences of mechanically removing it from sandy beaches. Results from multiple studies show that beach grooming practices, even seasonal schemes, can have major impacts on the ecology and sustainability of sandy beaches, many of which are already under stress from sea level rise and coastal development. Heavy equipment on the beach also destroys nesting habitats for shorebirds such as the Western snowy plover and can crush clutches of grunion eggs that female fish bury in intertidal nests in the sand."
