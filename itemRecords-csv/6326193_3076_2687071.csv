9,Abstract:,"Urban and suburban neighborhoods are generally paved with vast areas of impervious surfaces. These are surfaces such as streets, sidewalks, driveways, and garden paths constructed with traditional materials such as asphalt and concrete. These surfaces don't allow water to penetrate or percolate down into the soil. Instead, stormwater runoff flows into storm drains, carrying pollutants to the ocean at a high volume. Permeable paving can be one of several different materials that allows runoff to pass through the pavement and underlying stone bed, then into the soil below, filtering pollutants and recharging the groundwater supply. Studies indicate that porous paving can remove between 65and 85 percent of undissolved pollutants and up to 95 percent of sediment from runoff. Also, trees and large shrubs can be planted much closer to permeable paving that traditional paving, as the porosity allows for oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients to pass freely to the plants' root zones."
