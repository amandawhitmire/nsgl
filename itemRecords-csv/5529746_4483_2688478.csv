11,Abstract:,"The traditional separation of marine planktonic larvae into three trophic groupings (planktotrophy, facultative planktotrophy, and lecithotrophy) is based upon an ability, or lack thereof, to concentrate and capture particulate foods from seawater. However, this classification scheme does not consider an energy resource available to all soft-bodied invertebrate larvae, namely dissolved organic material (DOM) in seawater. In this study, larvae of the gastropod ""Haliotis refuscens"" were cultured until they were competent to settle. Changes in dry organic weight, biochemical composition, and metabolism were measured throughout their development. An energy budget was constructed to assess the contribution of endogenous reserves to their energy demands; comparison revealed that larvae of "". rufescens"" are not in energy balance, suggesting that these `nonfeeding' larvae are obtaining energy from their environment, presumably in the form of DOM."
