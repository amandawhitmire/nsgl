14,Abstract:,"Here the authors report the regiospecific bromoperoxidati​ve oxidation of 1,3-​di-​tert-​butylindole by vanadium bromoperoxidase (V-BrPO) from the marine algae ""Ascophyllum nodosum"" and ""Corallina officinalis."" Both enzymes lead to the production of the unbrominated 1,3-​di-​tert-​butyl-​2-​ indolinone product exclusively, in near quantitative yield. Further, reactivities of 1,3-​di-​tert-​butyl-​2-​indolinone with both aqueous bromine and V-BrPO differ significantly and shed light onto the possible nature of the oxidizing intermediate. This is the first example of a regiospecific bromination by a vanadium haloperoxidase and further extends their usefulness as catalysts."
