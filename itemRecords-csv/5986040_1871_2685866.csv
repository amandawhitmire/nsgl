13,Abstract:,"Four specis of exotic cordgrass (""Spartina"" sp.) occur in the San Francisco estuary in addition to the California native ""Spartina foliosa."" Our goal was to map the location and extent of all non-native ""Spartina"" in the estuary. Hybrids of ""S. alterniflora"" and ""S. foliosa"" are by far the most numerous exotic and are spreading rapidly. Radiating from sites of deliberate introduction, ""S. alterniflora"" and hybrids now cover ca. 190ha, mainly in the South and Central Bay. Estimates of rate of aerial increase range from a constant value to an accelerating rate of increase. This could be due to the proliferation of hybrid clones capable of rapid expansion and having superior seed set and string abilities. The total coverage of 195 ha by hybrids and other exotic cordgrass species is slightly less than 1% of the Bay's tidal mudflats and marshes. ""Spartina anglica"" has not spread beyond its original 1970s introduction site. ""Spartina densiflora"" has spread to cover over 5 ha at 3 sites in Central Bay. ""Spartina patens"" has expanded from 2 plants in 1970 to 42 plants at one site in Suisun Bay. ""Spartina"" seed floats on the tide, giving it the potential to export this invasion throughout the San Francisco estuary, and to estuaries outside of the Golden Gate. The authors found isolated plants of ""S. alterniflora"" and ""S. densiflora"" in outer coast estuaries north of the Bay suggesting the likelihood for the San Francisco Bay populations to found others on the Pacific coast."
