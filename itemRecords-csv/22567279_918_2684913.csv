10,Abstract:,"Seagrass beds are among the most valuable coastal habitats worldwide. They perform a wide range of important ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, sediment accretion and stabilization, and water purification (Nordlund et al. 2017). Eelgrass (Zostera marina), like other seagrasses, is a critical foundational habitat. Eelgrass creates habitat that leads to increased abundance and diversity of many invertebrate and fish species, and it serves as a nursery for ecologically and commercially-​valuable species. Eelgra​ss is a marine flowering plant with long, ribbon-like leaves that grow from an underground stem (rhizome). It is found worldwide in coastal waters. Eelgrass reproduces both sexually, via flowers and seed production, and asexually, via spreading rhizomes. Unpre​cedented declines in seagrass distribution have been observed worldwide and are a growing cause for concern. The reasons for the decline are attributed to many natural and anthropogenic factors in coastal ecosystems. Natural impacts may come from natural changes in water depth, salinity, wave velocity, turbidity due to sediment or phytoplankton blooms, and herbivory pressure. Anthropogenic impacts may be either direct or indirect. Direct impacts include seagrass removal by dredging, propeller scarring, or shading caused by boat moorings or pier construction. Indirect impacts include the introduction of invasive species and non-point source loading of nutrients, herbicides, and sediment which negatively impact water clarity (Hauxwell et al. 2003). The indirect effects associated with sea level rise and climate change are not well understood but are widely expected to negatively impact seagrass distribution globally (Ralph et al. 2007). Morro Bay supported the third largest eelgrass dominated ecosystem in the southern California region (Bernstein et al. 2011). However, eelgrass in Morro Bay has declined by more than 90% since 2007. This decline has spurred many restoration, monitoring, and research efforts. This report summarizes all eelgrass-​related activity in 2018. This includes small-scale experimental restoration efforts in the spring and detailed monitoring of restoration sites and existing eelgrass beds."
