13,Abstract:,"It was recently suggested that trehalose has the ability to stabilize hydrated phosphatidyleth​anolamines in the lamellar phase, based on experiments with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), which suggested that trehalose might prevent H11 formation by hydrated phosphatidyleth​anolamines. However, this study of the hydrated trehalose/phosp​hatidylethanola​mine system added to DSC and FTIR the method of X-ray diffraction. The results demonstrate clearly that rather than preventing H11 phase, the presence of trehalose promotes the formation of the H11 phase. In doing so the H11 forms directly from the gel phase without an intervening lamellar liquid-​crystalline phase. Evidence from all three experimental techniques is presented."
