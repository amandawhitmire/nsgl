20,Abstract:,"Estuaries and coastal wetlands are critical transition zones (CTZs) that link land, freshwater habitats, and the sea. In this comprehensive paper, the authors examine the role of biodiversity (both species composition and species richness) in ecological functions of marine CTZs. They discuss processes inherent to the ecological integrity of marine CTZs, including pathway functions that connect and transfer water, material, and organisms among land, fresh water, and the ocean. They also describe functional groups of organisms that are key to maintaining these processes, identify threats to biodiversity in marine CTZs, and consider the potential consequences of diversity change for ecosystem function. The focus is on sediment-â€‹associated biota."
