11,Abstract:,"The red abalone (""Haliotis rufescens""), a marine gastropod of both recreational and commercial importance, resides in low intertidal and subtidal zones along the entire California coast. During a normal year, abalones may be exposed to a seasonal water temperature variation of 9 to 19 deg. C. Such variation presents a serious source of stress to poikilothermic animals such as abalones; it is, therefore, of interest to determine whether seasonal changes in water temperature may interact with PCP to cause additive, synergistic, or potentiative toxic effects. Specifically, two effects were measured: the exposure times required for onset of PCP effects; and both intensity of, and recovery from, such effects. Results indicate that high temperature potentiates the time both to onset of and for recovery from the sublethal effects of PCP in the red abalone."
