10,Abstract:,"In the course of a search for bioactive natural products, the crude methanol extract of the alga ""Sargassum tortile"" showed insect growth inhibitory activity. Bioassay-â€‹directed purification of the methanol extract led to the isolation of a colorless liquid as the only active principle, and the compound was identified as crinitol, previously isolated from the marine alga ""Cystoseira crinita."" In this paper, the absolute configuration of the insect growth inhibitor crinitol is reported as established by application of the recently developed acyclic allylic benzoate method."
