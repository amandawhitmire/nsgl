9,Abstract:,"In this project, researchers compiled information on Common Murre (Uria aalge) population size, diet, field metabolic rate, prey energy densities and assimilation efficiency to estimate the bird's annual prey consumption between Cape Blanco, Oregon and Point Conception, Calififornia According to results in press in the ICES Journal of Marine Science, the murre population in the mid-2000s consumed about 225,000 metric tons (mt) of prey, including about 66,000 mt consumed by breeding adults; 48,000 mt consumed by nonbreeding birds during the breeding season; 111,000 mt consumed by all birds during the wintering period, and 200 mt consumed by chicks at breeding colonies. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the variation coefficient for the annual prey consumption estimate was +/- 13.2%. Pacific hake and market squid each comprised more than 20% of total prey biomass (excluding chicks at breeding season). Other species comprising at least 10% of the annual diet included shiner surfperch, northern anchovy and rockfish. Anchovy and sardine (63%), rockfish (21%) and smelt (7%) dominated chicks' diet. Most of the anchovy/sardine was likely northern anchovy (94% of those identified to species)."
