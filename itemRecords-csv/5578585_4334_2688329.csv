10,Abstract:,"Chemical investigation of the secondary metabolites of the marine sponge ""Aplysilla glacialis"", collected at French Wells in the Bahamas, resulted in the isolation and characterizatioâ€‹n of four diterpenes, two sterol endoperoxides, and two methylated primary metabolites. Some of these compounds, along with crude extracts of the sponge, were investigated for their ability to deter fish predation, affect the fouling of surfaces, and inhibit the growth of marine microorganisms."
