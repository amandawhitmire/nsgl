10,Abstract:,"One of the main tasks in designing a floating structure is to ensure its safety and seaworthiness. Despite recent advances in ship hydrodynamics, the possibility and actual process of capsizing are still difficult to predict. The objective of this work has been to develop a numerical model that realistically represents the motions of a steered vessel in severe, random seas, up to and including capsize conditions. The aim was to numerically identify different modes of capsizing that had been observed experimentally, and to study the mechanisms and conditions that lead to capsizing. Particular attention is paid to ship behavior and its simulation in irregular following and quartering seas."
