14,Abstract:,"Penaeids normally reproduce offshore in oceanic water. Under laboratory conditions the reproductive tract of male penaeids often deteriorates and darkens due to the deposition of a black substance presumed to be melanin; males experiencing this degenerative change are infertile. The factors responsible for degeneration are not known; however, the problem is of importance to individuals using penaeids for aquaculture or experimental purposes. In this study, a time-course experiment was undertaken to characterize the degenerative changes occurring in ""Penaeus setiferus"" during maintenance in the laboratory. This species was chosen as its tract is especially susceptible to darkening in captivity."
