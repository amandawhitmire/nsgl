11,Abstract:,This paper presents a 'state configured layered control' software architecture specifically designed to enable fully autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to carry out complex missions with good real-time performance on modest computers. It can be configured by a user for a given mission in a relatively straightforward fashion. Results from layered control tests on a real vehicle were used to motivate the architecture. Survey-type missions were conducted in simulation to test the approach.
