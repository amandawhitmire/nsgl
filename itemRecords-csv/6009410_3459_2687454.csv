15,Abstract:,"""Streptococcus iniae"" represents a major health and economic problem in fish species worldwide. Random Tn917 mutagenesis and high-throughput screening in a hybrid striped bass (HSB) model of meningoencephal​itis identified attenuated ""S. iniae"" mutants. The Tn917 insertion in one mutant disrupted an ""S. iniae"" homologue of a phosphoglucomut​ase (pgm) gene. Electron microscopy revealed a decrease in capsule thickness and cell wall rigidity, with delta-PGM mutant cells reaching sizes approx. 3-fold larger than those of the wild type (WT). The delta-PGM mutant was cleared more rapidly in HSB blood and was more sensitive to killing by cationic antimicrobial peptides including moronecidin from HSB. In vivo, the delta- PGM mutant was severely attenuated in HSB, as intraperitoneal challenge with 1,000 times the WT lethal dose produced only 2.5% mortality. Reintroduction of an intact copy of the ""S. iniae"" pgm gene on a plasmid vector restored antimicrobial peptide resistance and virulence to the delta-PGM mutant. In analysis of the aborted infectious process, the authors found that delta-PGM mutant organisms initially disseminated to the blood, brain, and spleen but were eliminated by 24 h without end organ damage. Ninety to 100% of fish injected with the delta-PGM mutant and later challenged with a lethal dose of WT ""S. iniae"" survived. The authors conclude that the pgm gene is required for virulence in ""S. iniae"", playing a role in normal cell wall morphology, surface capsule expression, and resistance to innate immune clearance mechanisms. An ""S. iniae"" delta-PGM mutant is able to stimulate a protective immune response and may have value as a live attenuated vaccine for aquaculture."
