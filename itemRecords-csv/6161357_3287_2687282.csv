11,Abstract:,"We measured a set of 37 morphological characteristics in 97 specimens of adult Korean chub, Zacco koreanus, trapped in the Milyang River, Korea, in May and October of 2005. Twelve out of thirty-seven morphometric measurements were significantly different between the sexes. In particular, both the pectoral fin length and the direct distance between the insertion of the dorsal fin and the insertion of the anal fin were highly significant (p < 0.001). This sexual dimorphism may reflect the outcome of sexual selection in this species."
