10,Abstract:,"Although growth hormone (GH) receptors are encoded by a single gene, evidence from cross-linking studies and monoclonal antibody analyses indicates that there are multiple forms of the protein. Receptors for GH are highly concentrated in liver, and are also present in kidney, gill, intestine, gonads, and brain. To investigate further the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in GH binding, the effects of a disulfide-bond reducing agent on hepatic GH binding by striped bass (""Morone saxatilis"") are reported here. Also, hepatic GH receptors from both striped bass and coho salmon were cross-linked to radiolabeled GH, digested with deglycosylation enzymes, and analyzed by electrophoresis​."
