11,Abstract:,"As fishermen look for avenues beyond wholesale buyers to sell their catch, direct sales to consumers have increased in popularity in recent years. This guide discusses permits and guidelines for commercially licensed fishermen who want to sell their own fresh catch from their vessels directly to the ultimate consumer in selected Northern California coastal counties (from San Mateo to Del Norte). Future guide revisions will include additional California coastal counties, harbors/marinas and policies as they become available."
