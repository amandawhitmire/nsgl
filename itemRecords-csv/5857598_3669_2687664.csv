12,Abstract:,"This paper addresses the use of redox dyes as indicators of the respiratory or metabolic activity of ""Giardia"" cysts and ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" oocysts. When combined with fluorescent antibodies, the technique enables the simultaneous detection of the cysts and determination of their redox activity potential. The multi-channel detection capabilities of the instruments used in this study make it possible to perform quantitative measurements of the redox activity per cyst, in combination with other cell parameter properties, and to analyze large numbers of cysts in a short period. The method is also applicable for addressing questions about metabolic activity of the cysts during their life period (dormancy-​reactivation), as well as their response to chemical and pharmacological treatment in any type of water or animal sample."
