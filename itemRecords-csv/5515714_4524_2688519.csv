11,Abstract:,"Dysinin-type sesquiterpenes have been isolated during an investigation of the anthelmintic constituents of ""Dysidea herbacea"" collected from Fiji. This report considers the absolute stereochemical assignments of these dysinin sesquiterpenes along with an analysis of the separate occurrence of members of the two enantiomeric series. Results of the anthelmintic evaluation of dysinins are included."
