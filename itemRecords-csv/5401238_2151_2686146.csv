10,Abstract:,"A study was conducted at the American River trout hatchery in California to determine how the observed onset of PKD is related to a seasonal presence of the infectious stage in the water supply, to water temperatures and fish introduction schedules. Results indicated that the infectious stage was present in the water supply from April through November with the peak prevalence of infection occurring in June. Infections were not observed in the winter months (December-â€‹March) in groups exposed to ambient or heated hatchery water. The failure to detect PKX in fish exposed at 27 deg C (heated group) and subsequently incubated at 18 deg C, temperatures conducive to the development of the disease, supports the conclusion that the infectious stage of PKD was truly absent, or below threshold levels able to induce infections, during the winter."
