12,Abstract:,"The current practice of wave load modeling for failure path based system reliability analysis consists of using a deterministic wave load pattern (corresponding to the position of a regular design wave with respect to the structure when the base shear is maximum) scaled by the total lateral load (base shear) which is considered random. However, local variations due to uneven marine growth and uncertainties in modeling wave forces result in less than perfect correlation among the nodal wave forces. In the present work, an analytical form is assumed for the spatial distribution of correlation between nodal wave forces. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the effects of variation of the correlation model parameters on both the member level and system level failure probabilities including changes in potential failure sequences."
