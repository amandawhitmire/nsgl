11,,"Pipelines are exposed to various wave and current conditions in the ocean; the spatial orientation of the pipeline with respect to the flow conditions and marine biofouling can increase the hydrodynamic forces considerably. Research was performed at Oregon State University in the laboratory concerning the forces on vertical and horizontal cylinders in waves. The force differences are displayed with the force transfer coefficients; tests were performed on smooth, sand-roughened and artificially marine-â€‹roughened cylinders. Results for the vertical cylinder show significant increases in both the force transfer coefficients and the maximum forces."
