11,Abstract:,"Researchers have identified the steroids produced endogenously by ovarian follicles collected from mature white sturgeon females. Suggestive identification of these steroids was based on their isopolarity with authentic standards on high performance liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography-â€‹mass spectrometry provided for the positive identification of several steroids. The objective of this work was to examine the potency of several of these steroids in the in vitro induction of oocyte maturation."
