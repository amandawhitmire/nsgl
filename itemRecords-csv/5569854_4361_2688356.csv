10,Abstract:,"The number of polycyclic aromatic alkaloids isolated from sessile marine invertebrates has increased rapidly in the last several years. Their significant antitumor activities and remarkable structural features have attracted considerable attention from both synthetic chemists and pharmacologists​. This paper reports the isolation and structural elucidation of two octacyclic alkaloids, eudistones A and B, which are minor metabolites of the Seychelles tunicate ""Eudistoma"" sp."
