11,Abstract:,"Species of the gymnosperm ""Podocarpus"" species have been reported to be resistant to many insects, and nor- and bisnorditerpene dilactones such as nagilactones from these plants have been shown to be responsible, at least in part, for this resistance. These terpenoids have been previously reported to be toxic to the housefly, the codling moth, and several other important agricultural pests. For previous experiments, nagilactones were isolated from ""Podocarpus nagi"" collected in Nara, Japan. These plants have been studied most extensively. For this study, ""P. nagi"" was collected from the Kochi and Kagoshima regions, where the nagilactones were different both in quality and quantity. Distributions of nagilactones in different parts of ""P. nagi"", expecially in the fruit, were analyzed, and the feeding deterrence and growth inhibtion of the four most abundant nagilactones larvae of the tobacco budworm, ""Heliothis virescens"", were tested."
