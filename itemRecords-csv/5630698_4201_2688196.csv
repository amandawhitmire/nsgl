13,Abstract:,"Insulin-​dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), when untreated or poorly controlled in mammals, results in growth retardation. To determine whether the same relationship exists in an ectothermic vertebrate, IDDM-like symptoms were induced in a teleost fish, the goby ""Gillichthys mirabilis"" by surgical removal of its pancreatic endocrine (islet) organ. Isletectomized (Ix) gobies lost body weight, their skeletal growth was retarded, as measured by changes in body weight, and they exhibited a 50% reduction in cartilage 35SO4 incorporation ""in vitro"", consistent with changes that occur in mammals with IDDM. Injections of bovine insulin into the Ix fish restored body growth parameters to control levels and stimulated cartilage 35SO4 incorporation in a dose- related manner. Diabetic fish did not develop resistance to growth stimulation by either GH or IGF-I. While these results support a role for insulin in maintaining the GH-IGF-I-growth axis in this ectothermic vertebrate, there may be important differences in the role of insulin in the promotion of anabolic processes."
