11,Abstract:,"This paper reports the isolation of four metabolites, all derivatives of the well-known microbial antibiotic enterocin (or vulgamycin), from an unidentified Western Australian ascidian of the genus ""Didemnum"". Isolated in this study were enterocin itself, 5-​deoxyenterocin, enterocin-5- behenate, and enterocin-​5-​arachidate, specific derivatives of this rare class of microbially-​produced antibiotics. This study adds further support for the concept that bacteria may produce some of the interesting molecules isolated from marine invertebrates."
