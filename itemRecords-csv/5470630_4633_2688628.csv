9,Abstract:,"An 8-week growth trial was conducted to compare the growth performance of hatchery-â€‹produced juvenile white sturgeon fed purified diets with different proteins. The diets were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous and contained one of eight different proteins as their sole protein source. The proteins were control (casein:wheat gluten:egg white, 62:30:8), casein, gelatin, egg white, soybean concentrate, and defatted herring, shrimp, and zein meals. Growth, feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio, productive protein value, and percent energy retained of sturgeon fed different proteins were significantly different. The body composition of sturgeon was also significantly different, and the difference was closely related to the fish growth."
