10,Abstract:,"The FDA Fish List is a compilation of existing acceptable market names for imported and domestically available food fish. The list was developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in cooperation with the National Marine Fisheries Service. Its purpose is to promote uniformity in the use of FDA acceptable market names by the fish industry, and to provide consistent advice on these names. The list represents an extensive, although not necessarily complete, listing of food fish commonly sold in the United States."
