15,Abstract:,"During the spring and summer upwelling season (April- August) of the El Nino and La Nina years 1997-99, researchers monitored settlement of juvenile crabs and sea urchins in northern California. They examined the relationships among wind-driven upwelling/relaxâ€‹ation, temperature salinity, and the settlement response of sea urchins and cancrid and non-cancrid crabs."
