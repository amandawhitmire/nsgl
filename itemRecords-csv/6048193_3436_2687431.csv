9,Abstract:,"Sea Grant Marine Extension Advisor Leigh Taylor Johnson wants boaters to know the problems caused by invasive species, to recognize common invasive fouling organisms on boat hulls and to learn to take steps to prevent their spread. To this end, her office has just produced a colorful, bilingual, educational poster, ""Stop Aquatic Invaders on Our Coast! /�Detenga el Transporte de Especies Invasoras Acu�ticas en Nuestras Costas!"" and is providing it free of charge to marinas, harbormasters, fishers, boat owners and anyone else interested in learning more about preventing the spread of invasive species through boat bottoms."
