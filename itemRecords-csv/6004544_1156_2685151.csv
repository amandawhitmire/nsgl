22,,"A 3-year study was conducted to evaluate mussels as bioindicators of faecal contamination in coastal ecosystems of California. Haemolymph samples from 4680 mussels (""Mytilus"" spp.) were tested for ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" genotypes using PCR amplification and DNA sequence analysis. The authors hypothesize that mussels collected from sites near livestock runoff or human sewage outflow would be more likely to contain the faecal pathogen ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" than mussels collected distant to these sites, and that the prevalence would be greatest during the wet season when runoff into the nearshore marine environment was highest. To test these hypotheses, 156 batches of sentinel mussels were collected quarterly at nearshore marine sites considered at higher risk for exposure to livestock runoff, higher risk for exposure to human sewage, or lower risk for exposure to both faecal sources. ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" genotypes detected in Haemolymph samples from individual mussels included ""Cryptosporidiu​m parvum,"" ""Cryptosporidiu​m felis,"" ""Cryptosporidiu​m andersoni,"" and two novel ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" spp. Factors significantly associated with detection of ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" spp. in mussel batches were exposure to freshwater outflow and mussel collection within a week following a precipitation event. Detection of ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" spp. was not associated with higher or lower risk status for exposure to livestock faeces or human sewage sources. This study showed that mussels can be used to monitor water quality in California and suggests that humans and animals ingesting faecal-​contaminated water and shellfish may be exposed to both host-specific and anthropozoonoti​c ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" genotypes of public health significance."
