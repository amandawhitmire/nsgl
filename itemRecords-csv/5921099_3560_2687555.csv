18,Abstract:,"Essential to the evolutionary divergence of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) systems was the presence of soluble IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). With high affinities for IGFs, but no binding affinity for insulin, IGFBPs block IGFs from binding to the insulin receptor. IGFBPs further evolved within the vertebrate line into centralized 'integrators' of the endocrine growth- regulatory apparatus. The six principal mammalian IGFBPs exhibit an array of specialized properties that appear to be derived from a complex evolutionary history. This review highlights selected 'comparative aspects' in the current IGFBP research, in an attempt to view this essential group of endocrine regulators from a wide biological perspective."
