Results from laboratory testing programs are used to determine if a public health hazard exists in eating sport-caught fish from certain locations in California where elevated levels of DDT, PCBs, chlordane and mercury have been reported. Recommendations for consumption levels are offered. Also available in Spanish (CUIMR-​G-​91-​007)."
