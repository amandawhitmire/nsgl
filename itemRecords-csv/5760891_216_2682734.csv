9,Abstract:,"In California and elsewhere, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) serve as a primary tool for protecting and sustaining intertidal ecosystems. Throughout much of urban southern California, California Marine Life Refuges (CMLRs) are the principal form of MPA designed to protect intertidal organisms. However, CMLRs allow recreational fishing and, while placing restrictions on the collecting of most species of invertebrates and seaweeds, do not limit visitor access. In a year-long study of eight sites in Orange County, California, four of which have been designated CLMRs since 1968-71, unlawful collecting was observed to be widespread and frequent both in and outside historical CMLR boundaries. Human visitation is often extreme on southern Claifornia rocky shores. The canopy-forming rockweed ""Pelvetia compressa"" suffers substantial damage from trampling, including the loss of large amounts of potential reproductive material. It is concluded that CMLRs, as currently designed and patrolled, are ineffective in protecting coastal populations in regions of high visitor density. Knowledge of the current status of coastal ecosystems and the processes that affect them should be used to evaluate California's MPA system with the goal of designing truly effective refuges and sanctuaries for sustaining coastal populations."
