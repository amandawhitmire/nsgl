10,Abstract:,"The channel 3 data of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on the NOAA series of weather satellites (NOAA 6-12) are contaminated by instrumentation noise. The signal to noise ration (S/N) varies considerably from image to image and the between sensor variation in S/N can be large. The characteristics of the channel noise in the image data are examined using Fourier techniques and a Wiener filtering technique is developed to reduce the noise in the channel 3 image data. Use of the filtered data to improve image segmentation, labeling in cloud screening algorithms for AVHRR data, and multichannel sea surface temperature estimates is demonstrated. The method can also be used with success in land applications. The Wiener filtering model is compared with alternate filtering methods and is shown to be superior in all applications tested."
