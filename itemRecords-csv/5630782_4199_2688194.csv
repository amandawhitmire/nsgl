16,Abstract:,"Twelve out of twenty-nine compounds isolated from benthic marine algae from the phyla Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta and Rhodophyta have been found to be potent inhibitors of bee venom derived phospholipase A2 (>50%) in the micrometer range. This is the first report of bee venom PLA2 inhibition ""in vitro"" by pure compounds isolated from marine algae."
