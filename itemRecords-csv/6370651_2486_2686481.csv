9,Abstract:,"Deep sea deposit feeders selectively ingest large volumes of sediments. Knowledge of the nature of this selectivity will help to elucidate the limiting nutritional components and geochemical impacts of these abundant animals. Shallow water and theoretical studies suggest that deep-sea deposit feeders should select particles rick in protein, bacterial biomass, and /or chloropigment concentrations. Recent studies indicate that deep-sea surface deposit feeders exhibit strong enrichment of excess (xs) ^234 Th activity and chlorophyll a in their gut sediments. Th is scavenged in the water column by sinking particles, yielding and ""excess activity"" when these particles reach the seafloor. The excess activity exceeds the activity supported by the decay of U within particles. Due to its 24 day half life, Thxs activity may be used to trace particle behavior for ~100 days after material reaches the seafloor. Synchronously, labile organic matter associated with recently settle particles in degraded, presumably lowering the material's food value. Thxs activity is easily measured and strongly selected by megafaunal deposit feeders, even though it lacks nutritional quality itself. What can this selection for Th tell us about the feeding of deep-sea deposit feeders? To rest what food qualities excess Th activity is correlated with, surface sediments were analyzed from three quiescent bathyal basins off Southern California for Thxs activity and concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl a), enzymatically hydrolysable amino acids (EHAA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and total organic carbon and nitrogen. Chl a, a labile photopigment, was used as a tracer of fresh phytoplankton detritus. EHAA is used to estimate concentrations of amino acids in sediments extractable by the gut enzmes of deposit feeders. Lastly, ATP concentrations are used to estimate microbial biomass in sediments. Thxs activity was positively correlated with chl a and phaeopigment concentrations and not linearly correlated with concentrations of EHAA, ATP, organic carbon, or organic nitrogen. The results suggest that deep-sea deposit feeders select Thxs activity because it is associated with recently settled phytodetrital material. However, there is no evidence that this Thxs activity -rich material is particularly rich in labile amino acids or microbial biomass. Phytodetrital material may be an important source of some other limiting nutrient to deep-sea deposit feeders, e.g., organic carbon, polyunsaturated fatty acids and/or vitamins."
