13,Abstract:,"Resources and programs offered by six professional societies for graduate students and early career professionals in the ocean sciences are cataloged and profiled. The organizations range from very large and international (American Geophysical Union), to two mid-size organizations (Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography and Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispan​ics and Native Americans in Science), to three smaller ones (Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation, The Oceanography Society, and Marine Technology Society). All of these societies support focused programs for undergraduate and graduate students as well as early career professionals including postdoctoral fellows. Three of the societies co-sponsor the large biennial Ocean Sciences Meeting in even years that have, in the last decade, offered a wide variety of programs for student and early career groups."
