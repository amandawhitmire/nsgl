9,Abstract:,"Seafood comes in all types of prepared forms and sushi from the Japanese culture is one of the versatile dishes that most consumers can enjoy. Sushi, not to be confused with sashimi, is a Japanese food made of cooked vinegared rice (shari) mixed with other ingredients or toppings called neta. The most common neta in sushi is seafood which may be raw or cooked. Raw fish is known as sashimi; not all sushi is sashimi. Sometimes the terms are used interchangeablyâ€‹, but the two are uniquely different dishes. Some sushi dishes might not even contain seafood and could appeal to your vegetarian customers."
