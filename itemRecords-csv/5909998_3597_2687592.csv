11,Abstract:,"To assess the role of parasites in marine invasions, the authors review reasons why introduced species often leave their natural enemies behind. They define three types of invasion success and explore whether parasites can facilitate the success or failure of introduced marine species. They use a theoretical framework developed to model invasion success; and compare published studies of introduced species in both their native and introduced geographic ranges to examine the extent to which lack of parasites is a general phenomenon in marine invasions. They also review cases in which infected hosts invade new regions, and explore the potential for introduced marine parasites and pathogens to impact native ecosystems. Finally, they discuss the importance of parasites as an indirect impact of invaders on food webs."
