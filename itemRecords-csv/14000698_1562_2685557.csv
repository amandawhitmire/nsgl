10,Abstract:,"If you canâ€™t see something with your eyes, can it leave fingerprints? According to Professor Kevin Kelley of California State University, Long Beach, something invisible indeed leaves fingerprints; to find them you just have to use the right tools and know where to look. Dr. Kelley and his research team use cutting-edge technologies to ""see"" the molecular fingerprints caused by chemical pollution in marine organisms off the urban Southern California coastline. These methods provide new, more cost-effective mechanisms to detect negative health effects of contaminants in organisms, and insights into potential effects on human health."
