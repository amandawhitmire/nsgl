11,Abstract:,"Chemical studies of the Caribbean red alga ""Vidalia obtusaloba"" have resulted in the isolation of two new bromophenolic metabolites, vidalols A and B. The new compounds were discovered as part of an organized effort to isolate new naturally-​occurring antiinflammator​y agents with a focus upon those which may function through the inhibition of phospholipase A2."
