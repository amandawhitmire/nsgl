8,Abstract:,"The Olympia oyster was once a profitable commercial commodity along the Pacific coast, as well as an important contributor to estuarine health and species diversity. However, overharvesting, urban development, pollution, siltation, and the introduction of non-native species have caused significant declines in native oyster populations. Today remnant, reproductive populations of native oyster still exist throughout much of the historic range from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico, although the northern range limit may be northern British Columbia."
