11,Abstract:,"Wave interactions with sediments have received considerable attention in the literature but frequently sediment properties have been assumed rather than measured. The coupling of water waves with cohesive sediment response was the incentive for this study on cohesive sediment rheology under oscillatory forcing. Experimental measurements demonstrate that clay muds behave as elastic solids at low oscillatory strains, and as viscous fluids at high oscillatory strains. At intermediate strains the sediment must be described as a viscoelastic material with properties that depend on forcing as well as mineralogy and solids content. Experimental measurements of cohesive sediment rheology are necessary inputs for predicting the cohesive sediment fluidization depth and the water-wave damping."
