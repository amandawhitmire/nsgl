12,Abstract:,"A previously described electrical stimulation technique for collecting spermatophores from living lobsters (""Homarus americanus"") was used successfully on ""H. americanus"", ""H. gammarus"" and hybrid males. Laboratory reared ""H. americanus"" and ""H. gammarus"" extruded spermatophores in 60-85% of all trials; the majority of these were of high quality containing large sperm masses with morphologically normal sperm. Stressed ""H. americanus"" extruded fewer spermatophores of shorter length and inferior quality. Hybrid males extruded spermatophores possessing a morphologically normal wall, but lacking sperm. This electrical stimulation technique can be used to screen males for spermatophore production and identify certain types of infertility."
