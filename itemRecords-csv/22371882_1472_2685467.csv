12,Abstract:,"Climate change preparation should include water quality improvement and conservation measures, particularly in urban ecosystems. The project site, Manzanita Canyon, is located in the heart of a “disadvantaged” community in San Diego, California. In urban watersheds such as this, ecosystems provide services disproportionat​e to their size, yet are also highly vulnerable to climate change hazards because of the heavy reliance on services and the relatively degraded state. This two-year project improved water quality and climate resilience of an urban ecosystem and an underserved community by engaging 2,253 community members in stewardship activities; restoring 7.56 acres of native coastal scrub ecosystem, including planting, maintaining and monitoring 1,536 natives; and removing 22 metric tons (758 m3) of invasive plants and trash."
