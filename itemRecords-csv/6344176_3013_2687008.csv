9,Abstract:,"Two federal agencies, US Department of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, recently released the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Consumers (including pregnant and breastfeeding women) are encouraged to eat seafood for its heart and brain benefits. For the general adult population, the recommendation is that consumers increase the amount of seafood they eat to at least 8 to 12 ounces (2-3 servings) weekly; the serving size for young children should be less. The Dietary Guidelines specifically address consumer confusion by stating that pregnant and breastfeeding women should eat at least 8 and up to 12 ounces (2-3 servings) of seafood each week to boost babies' brain and eye development. The palm of your hand can be used to estimate the size of a 4-ounce portion of fish. Currently, pregnant and breastfeeding women consume less than 2 ounces of seafood per week."
