Project partners include attorneys from the National Sea Grant Law Center, University of Mississippi School of Law; Rhode Island Sea Grant Legal Program, Roger Williams University School of Law; Virginia Coastal Policy Center,William & Mary Law School; Carl Vinson Institute of Government, University of Georgia; and the California Sea Grant Program. In collaboration with shellfish industry members and the wider Sea Grant network, the Project Team identified eight priority legal and policy barriers or success stories that would benefit from the development of case studies. The following eight Case Study titles are in this report: 1. The effects of the Endangered Species Act on shellfish aquaculture in New Jersey., p. 6. 2. Shellfish aquaculture permitting under NWP 48, p. 15. 3. Overcoming impediments to shellfish aquaculture: Access to public boat launches, p. 27. 4.
