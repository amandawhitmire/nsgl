12,Abstract:,"In this chapter, we discuss the Sacramento River restoration project as an example of the biological, physical, and social barriers and bridges that can exist when attempting large-scale riparian restoration (Gore and Shields 1995; Wohl et al. 2005). Large-scale river restoration must take into account the complex social and biophysical interactions that occur between different patches across landscapes. For example, stakeholders bring multiple frames of reference to restoration projects, including reasonable objections to restoration and valuing natural capital (Pahl-Wostl 2006). Although restorationists generally view restoration as having only positive effects, many stakeholders view it as having local negative effects. Whether these negative effects are real or perceived, large-scale restoration projects must incorporate these concerns as part of their research and management programs. We discuss potential methods for restoring the Sacramento River, the conflicts that have arisen due to perceived negative impacts, and methods for resolving these conflicts. We also discuss the lessons learned and how they may be applied to other restoration projects facing social conflicts."
