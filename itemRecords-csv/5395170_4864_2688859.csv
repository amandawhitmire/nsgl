8,Abstract:,"This study was initiated to determine if crab egg age somehow cues the onset of egg predation by nemerteans. Worms of differing ages were exposed to eggs of differing ages, but the picture which emerged was too complex to confirm or explain the field observation that the worms feed minimally during the crabs' early brooding period. While egg age may still be an important cue in the latter part of the worms' trophic period (very old eggs were avoided), very young eggs, at least in vitro, did not inhibit predation by any age or sex class of worms."
