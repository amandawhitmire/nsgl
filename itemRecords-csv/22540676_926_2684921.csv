10,Abstract:,"Seventy percent of Earth’s surface are oceans and 99% of the Earth’s living space is provided by the oceans. Besides, oceans provide the highest amount of protein for human consumption although it is being “farmed” mostly from wild animals. Domestication of marine life is almost not existent. Domestication of wild species improves yield and efficiency of farming. (Turcotte, Araki, Karp, Poveda, & Whitehead, 2017). This is a contrast to land-based agriculture production, which is mainly based of domesticated products. Ocean based farming, also called aquaculture, has great potential to feed the world. More precisely, aquaculture is defined as the breeding, rearing, and harvesting of all types of animals and plants in any type of water environments. Although aquaculture is a very old practice, up until the 1970’s the amount of sea food produced by aquaculture was approximately the same as the amount of sea food produced by wild capture. After the 1990’s, production from wild capture stayed the same, while aquaculture production increased steadily every year up until 2016 (FAO 2018) and is predicted to continue to grow (FAO, 2016). The main reason for this is that we are already harvesting the wild as much as we can and any further harvesting will result in the decay of natural environment, which provides the food. To prevent this, worldwide fisheries management activities are in place. Given that harvesting the wild habitats is not a sustainable way to increase food production, aquaculture is a great solution for this problem."
