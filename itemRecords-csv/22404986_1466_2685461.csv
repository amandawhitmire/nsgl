8,Abstract:,"Knowing how to identify adult coho salmon, steelhead, and Chinook is a critical skill for anyone fishing waters where these species coexist. In some areas, such as the Russian River, coho and other salmon species are protected, and catching or harming one can lead to penalties and stiff fines. This guide, developed by the California Sea Grant Russian River Salmon and Steelhead Monitoring Program, can help you refine your salmon ID skills. For current fishing rules and regulations please visit the California Department of Fish and Wildlife website and call the Low-Flow Closure Hotline at 707-944-5533 before heading out on the water. If you are not completely confident in the identification of a fish, handle it with great care and release immediately."
