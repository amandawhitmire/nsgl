9,Abstract:,"This study considers in historical perspective the ethical and juridical norms relevant to commercial and indigenous whaling activities and their regulation. The author rejects arguments by Japan, Norway, and various scholars that coastal whaling communities in industrialized countries should be regarded as equivalent to indigenous whaling communities such as the Inuit in justifying exceptions to the International Whaling Commission's moratorium. Only strongly based indigenous cultural claims should be permitted to trump a general rule against whaling."
