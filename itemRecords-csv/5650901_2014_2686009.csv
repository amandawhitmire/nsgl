11,Abstract:,"Highly fragmented populations connected by low levels of dispersal can be subject to sudden collapse caused by slow environmental degradation below a persistence threshold. Precipitous changes are particularly likely if the populations display Allee effects, i.e., depressed per capita survivorship or fecundity as populations become small. Most benthic marine invertebrate populations consist of isolated subpopulations of relatively sessile adults, which interact through dispersing larvae. This paper explores the effectiveness of using marine reserves as a conservation mechanism for such marine populations with Allee effects, to insure that there are always enough high density source areas to maintain regional population stability."
