10,Abstract:,"Here researchers treat restoration of a salt marsh in Mission Bay, California, as a large-scale experiment to investigate controls on early succession of macrofaunal invertebrates. They evaluate (1) modes of initial recolonization, (2) soil and vegetation factors influencing faunal recruitment and succession, (3) recovery relative to an adjacent natural system, and (4) potential influence of the atypical environmental conditions associated with El Nino on recovery processes."
