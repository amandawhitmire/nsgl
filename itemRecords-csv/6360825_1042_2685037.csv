15,Abstract:,"Between 1999 and 2010, we documented incidental catch of one hundred eleven juvenile White Sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) during surveys of the artisanal and commercial fisheries along the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico and opportunistical​ly collected stomach samples. Sharks ranged in size from 123 to 274 cm total length (TL). Most (79.8%) were young of the year (YOY) (≤175 cm TL), and the remainder were juvenile White Sharks (JWS) (>175?300 cm TL). Of the four documented fishing-gear types, bottom gillnets represented 74.7% of the catch, followed by drift gillnet (18.0%), artisanal seine net (4.5%), and surface longline (2.7%). Catch data indicate that the continental shelf is an important habitat for YOY and JWS in the region, with a possible core nursery area in Bahia Sebastian Vizcaino, where sixty-six YOY specimens were documented. Stomach content analysis for fourteen JWS agree with previous studies showing that the species feeds primarily on bony fish and demersal elasmobranchs. National (NOM-059 and NOM-029) and international [Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES)] regulations ban the capture and trade of this species. However, monitoring of all White Shark catches is complicated by the remote nature of the fishing grounds, as well as socioeconomic considerations. Our data suggest that future White Shark conservation must include cooperative research and management plans between Mexico and the United States."
