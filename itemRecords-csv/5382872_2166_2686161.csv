9,Abstract:,"This paper reports on research conducted in support of a coastal zone management effort to reduce erosion and sedimentation impacts in a wetland watershed in Monterey County, California. Methods of determining soil erosion susceptibility are reviewed and related to land-use intensity within the watershed, measured by a land disturbance index. Erosion susceptibility is measured in three ways: by a combination of slope and the erosion factor of the Universal Soil Loss Equation; by field measurement of erosion and deposition on selected sites; and by computer-​assisted terrain analysis of data from secondary sources. Land use is shown to be a more important factor than landform in influencing relative erosion susceptibility."
