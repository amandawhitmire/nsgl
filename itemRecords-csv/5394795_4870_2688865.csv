12,Abstract:,"The cytotoxic nonpolar extract of a Fiji sponge contains a simple chiral butenolide which is accompanied by epimeric substituted 3,6-​dihydro-​1,2-​dioxins, xestin A and xestin B. A 5""R"" absolute stereochemistry is proposed for the former. Among the three metabolites, xestin A is the most in-vitro active compound against leukemia cells."
