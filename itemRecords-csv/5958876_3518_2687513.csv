11,Abstract:,"Biweekly sediment trap samples were collected from the Santa Barbara Basin between August 1993 and April 2000. Researchers compare the siliceous phytoplankton species from these traps with mixed-layer phytoplankton samples from quarterly cruises. The outcome of this work is not a detailed interpretation of either data set but rather a comparison of their primary signals. The information content of each data set may be modified by several factors: the different total number and frequency of samples in the two data sets, the different temporal/spatiaâ€‹l scales represented by a single sample from each data set, and their different species compositions. The authors find that species' relationships, which are often expressed over relatively short scales of time and space, are better captured by the small-scale water samples. Regional oceanographic and climatic signals are more efficiently captured in trap samples, which integrate over small-scale variability."
