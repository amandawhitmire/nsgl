11,Abstract:,"In California, the fishery for red sea urchins grew rapidly from its beginnings in 1972 to become by the 1980s one of the state's most lucrative fisheries. But concerns about possible overexploitatio​n of the resource grew rapidly, and the California Department of Fish and Game and industry participants have negotiated an increasingly restrictive management system in an attempt to maintain a sustainable fishery. In addition, a landing tax has been established to fund research needed for wise management. Nonetheless the resource remains highly vulnerable. In order to obtain a broad perspective on utilization of California's kelp bed resources, and particularly sea urchins, a major Pacific Rim conference on sea urchins, kelp, and abalone was held in March 1992. This publication comprises full, unedited papers on resource management presented at the conference. Summaries of the conference presentations and discussion group recommendations will be published as a separate publication."
