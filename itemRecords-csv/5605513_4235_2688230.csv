10,Abstract:,"Moorings are ubiquitous in man's useful occupation of the ocean. They are used to secure instruments and other unattended apparatus for scientific, civil and military uses and to fix the location for various lengths of time of manned platforms for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction and for marine transportation and ocean construction applications. Subject to wave and current loads, vibration from eddy shedding, and a hostile chemical environment, moorings fatigue and eventually fail if not replaced in time. This research is directed toward significantly improving the reliability and the service life of ocean mooring systems by developing the use of nonconventional materials (particularly advanced composites) and constructions that are significantly less sensitive to fatigue and stress corrosion than conventional components. Subscale mooring elements (lines, terminations, and flexures) are tested for fatigue resistance in a seawater environment in the laboratory."
