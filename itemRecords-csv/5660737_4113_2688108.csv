10,Abstract:,"A system of high rate biofilter packed columns was operated using 'synthetic' fish waste in order to characterize the operating parameters and nitrification rate for aquacultural water. Two sets of experiments were conducted: the first was designed to determine the range of hydraulic loading rates that could be achieved with the nitrification columns. The second served to determine the effect of oxygen concentration on nitrification rate within the columns. The first experiment verified that the lowest hydraulic flow rate did not allow effective nitrification in the column. Conversely, the highest flow rate resulted in high nitrification rate but the column had a tendency to flood or restrict air flow as the filter matured. The second experiment resulted in nitrification rates that average 0.08 g m-2 d-1 with maximum of 0.15 g m-2 d-1."
