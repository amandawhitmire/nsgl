8,Abstract:,"As with the previous CWO conferences, CWO '10 will seek the experience, views and innovative ideas of experts throughout California, the United States, and the international community in addressing ocean and coastal resource management issues facing California and other states and nations. In addition, the conference will provide an opportunity to bring together representatives from government, academia, industry, and the public to share ideas and formulate action strategies for the 21st century. CWO '10 will take place as President Obama begins the implementation of a new national ocean policy and national framework for marine spatial planning. This is an exciting time for ocean and coastal policy in this nation and throughout the world, and participants should use this conference as an opportunity to help stimulate creative approaches to address the ecological, environmental and economic challenges that we face. Presentations at CWO '10 will address all ocean and coastal subjects that can be applied to resource management and policy. Emerging topics such as climate change impacts, marine spatial planning, marine protected areas, regional ocean governance, and renewable offshore energy will be featured, among other important topics. Presentations will focus on actions that can be taken at the local, state, regional, national, and international levels."
