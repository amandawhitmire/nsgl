15,Abstract:,"The goals of this research project were to 1) assess the performance of Pier 3 with respect to both the quantitative strain limit states and qualitative limit states described in the ""Seismic Design for California Marine Oil Terminals"" (Ferrito et al., 1999) and 2) back-calculate horizontal soil springs for silt-type soils found in West Coast ports. In order to accomplish these goals ambient vibration, forced vibration, and lateral load tests were performed on reinforced precast concrete piles and pile groups of Pier 3 at the Port of Long Beach."
