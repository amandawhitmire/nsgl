14,Abstract:,"Catalytic halogenation reactions are presently carried out with haloperoxidase enzymes. For instance, vanadium bromoperoxidase (V-BrPO) catalyzes the bromination of a variety of organic substrates under mild conditions using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant of bromide. Like V-BrPO titanium (IV)-grafted mesoporous silicate materials (e.g., Ti/MCM-48 18) and Ti/MCM-41) efficiently catalyze peroxidative halogenation reactions in aqueous solution at neutral pH and in organic solvents. As such, they are the first functional biomimics of vanadium bromoperoxidase which perform at neutral pH. Catalytic halogenation has many useful applications in synthetic organic chemistry, both as end products and as synthons. Thus, transition-​metal-​ion-​grafted MCM materials offer a simple, useful, and direct approach to catalytic halogenation."
