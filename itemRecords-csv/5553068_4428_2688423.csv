10,Abstract:,"Extraction of nucleic acids from red algae is complicated by the presence of phycocolloids. For this reason, methods used for nucleic acid isolation from other organisms are not always amenable to use with red algal preparations; modifications in some cases lead to protocols that are time consuming and complicated, often requiring large amounts of algal tissue for starting material. Described here are the isolation of both RNA and DNA followed by fractionation and identification of nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial DNAs from a single preparation of ""Polysiphonia boldii"" using a simple method that yielded approximately 100 micrograms of total RNA and 20 micrograms of total DNA from 1 gram of frozen powdered algae."
