10,Abstract:,"""Spartina alterniflora"", introduced into the UK in the 1800s, was the seed parent in an interspecific hybridization with ""S. maritima"". The sterile F1 hybrid ""S. x townsendii"" gave rise to the fertile allopolyploid ""S. anglica"" by chromosomal doubling. In this study the authors explore the hybrid origin of ""S. x townsendii"" and ""S. anglica"", survey worldwide populations of ""S. anglica"" for genetic variation to evaluate the likelihood of multiple origins, and distinguish the lineage of the female parent using nuclear DNA markers."
