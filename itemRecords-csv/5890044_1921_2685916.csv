9,Abstract:,"This study describes the reproductive collapse of a large giant-kelp forest (""Macrocystis pyrifera;"" Point Loma, southern California) and the dynamics of its subsequent recovery. High-frequency sampling within one area combined with a 3-year reproduction time-series from four other sites over a broad depth gradient were used to (1) quantify temporal and spatial patterns of change in size and fertility of adult sporophytes, and (2) examine physical and biological factors that regulate such changes. Results suggest a trade-off between sporophyte growth and reproduction, allowing short-term disturbances to have lasting impacts on the reproductive output of giant-kelp populations."
