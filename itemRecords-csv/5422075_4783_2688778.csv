9,Abstract:,"As part of a search for new bioactive substances from sponges, the authors found that crude extracts of ""Spongia mycofijiensis"" were extremely cytotoxic to epithelial carcinoma of the larynx and monkey kidney cells. During the course of collecting this sponge, we repeatedly observed that the nudibranch ""Chromodoris lochi"" was attached to it. Reported here are the two most abundant metabolites of both the sponge and nudibranch, which are latrunculin A, a 16-membered macrolide with an attached 2-​thiazolidinone unit, and dendrolasin, a simple furanosesquiter​pene."
