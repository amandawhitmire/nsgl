13,Abstract:,"The term 'live bottom' has been used to denote areas of hard bottom with broken relief that have large associated populations of sessile invertebrates and fishes. 'Live bottom' communities have been described in continental shelf waters from North Carolina to Texas. 'Live bottom' habitats are considered by several federal regulatory agencies to be areas of biological importance. The use of the term 'live bottom' suggests that other kinds of bottom habitats, especially soft bottom habitats, are unproductive and uninteresting. Research shows that soft bottoms support large, productive populations of benthic microalgae, demersal zooplankton, and eipfauna. Fishes associated with 'live bottom' habitats frequently obtain a substantial portion of their diets from soft bottom habitats, either by off-reef foraging or import of soft bottom-derived food items. It is suggested that the term 'live bottom' be replaced by the term 'hard bottom community.'"
