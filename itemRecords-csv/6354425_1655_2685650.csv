10,Abstract:,"On February 7, 2012, a US court in Los Angeles ordered a California company to pay $1million in fines and community service payments. The crime? Intentionally mislabeling frozen Pangasius fillets as Paradise grouper, Falcon Baie grouper and ponga. The company was also sentenced to three years of probation, ordered to forfeit all remaining inventory of mislabeled fish and to create and implement a corporate compliance plan. Federal agencies investigating the case include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Law Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs enforcement. The case was prosecuted by the Department of Justice, Environmental Crimes Section and the US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California. When species substitution (either accidentally or intentionally) occurs, restaurants, retailers and companies selling seafood to consumers risk years of bad publicity from the media, even if the restaurant or retailer did not realize the substitution or mislabeling occurred and/or it was a first time occurrence. It's possible that somewhere in the chain, from boat to plate, someone may have incorrectly mislabeled the fish. Thus, even if mislabeling was not intended by the seller, the risk of media revelation, tort liability, and regulatory punishment are real."
