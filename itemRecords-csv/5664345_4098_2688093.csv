11,Abstract:,"In Crustacea, it is possible that ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) expression or activation may vary in muscles through the moult cycle and between muscle groups at a given moult stage acting as a possible mechansism for differential regulation of growth. Reported here as part of a further investigation into the role of ecdysteroids in tissue growth, an immunocytochemi​cal study, using monoclonal antibodies to a ""Drosophila melanogaster"" EcR, was conducted to identify the presence of EcR in muscle and eyestalk neural tissue from lobsters."
