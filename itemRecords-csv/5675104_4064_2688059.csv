10,Abstract:,"The production of a precisely controlled radiation pattern is central to the proper design of many acoustical systems. Synthesis of a beam having a prescribed beam-width and low sidelobes is an important problem in this regard. This article describes the use of densely spaced random arrays to solve this problem. The theoretical development is presented, followed by a description of the design and construction of an underwater transducer which produces a Gaussian beam."
