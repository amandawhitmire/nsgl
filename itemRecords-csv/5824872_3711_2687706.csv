11,Abstract:,"The effect of pentachlorophen​ol (PCP) combined with salinity stress on specific aspects of cellular immunity was examined in two species of abalone. Overall, black abalone demonstrate greater phagocytic ability than red abalone both in the presence and absence of PCP. Furthermore, increases in salinity are accompanied with reduced phagocytic ability with red abalone demonstrating particular sensitivity to salinity variations. While PCP inhibits ATP synthesis, salinity variations may impose an additional stress on intertidal animals exposed to transient or seasonal environmental changes."
