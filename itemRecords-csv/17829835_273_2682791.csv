16,Abstract:,"This workshop was first in a series and convened to develop the frames of reference and rationale for creation of an offshore finfish aquaculture industry in southern California. It was attended by 44 people that represented a crosssection of scientists, regulators, and industry practitioners with proven expertise in the field of aquaculture and environmental science. All state and federal agencies with regulatory responsibilitie​s for permitting aquaculture were invited to participate and each agency was generally well represented. Workshop participants were asked to share and prioritize concerns regarding the complex, high-stakes environmental and resource issues often associated with coastal development activities. A professional facilitator guided conversations and consensus building activities, especially when tough policy questions combined lively politics and contested facts. While permitting remains an uncertain, uncoordinated, unstable, and inconsistent process for offshore farms in California, all workshop participants were requested to work together to formulate specific recommendations to improve the process for reviewing permits and obtaining approvals for aquaculture development projects. This summarizes the major findings and recommendations of this workshop."
