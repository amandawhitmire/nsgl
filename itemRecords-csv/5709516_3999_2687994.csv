10,Abstract:,"A 1600 base pair region of the mitochondrial rRNA genes from 74 yellowtail rockfish, collected from three north-east Pacific localities, was amplified via PCR. RFLP analysis yielded a total of 33 restriction sites allowing examination of 139 base pairs or 0-8% of the mtDNA molecule. Essentially no variation was detected within or among the three populations."
