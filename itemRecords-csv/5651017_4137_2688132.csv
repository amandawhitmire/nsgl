10,Abstract:,"Just after midnight on March 24, 1989, the tankship ""Exxon Valdez"" ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska. The consequences of the accident were the loss of 258,000 barrels of crude oil resulting in substantial environmental and economic loss. The vessel possessed the best technologies available to the tanker industry and was the pride of the Exxon fleet. However, the complexity and the potential catastrophic consequences of using these new technologies is leading to the examination of a more critical element: the human factor. It has been determined that approximately 65% of catastrophic marine- related accidents have been the result of compounded human and organizational errors (HOE) during operations. This paper examines (1) the human and organizational elements which led to the grounding of ""Exxon Valdez"", (2) structuring of the accident cause-effect relationships into an analytical framework, (3) methods for probabilistic risk analysis of HOE in the accident, (4) changes in operational and regulatory policy in the post- ""Exxon Valdez"" era, and (5) methods for determining HOE management alternatives for future tanker operations."
