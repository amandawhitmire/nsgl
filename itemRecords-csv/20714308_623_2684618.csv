11,Abstract:,"The Ocean Resources Enhancement and Hatchery Program (OREHP) was established by the California State Legislature in 1983 to conduct a program of basic and applied research on the artificial propagation, rearing and stocking of important marine fish species occurring in ocean waters off southern California (the OREHP’s original legislative intent; FGC § 6592). Over the years, the Legislature has modified language describing the intent of the program; current legislative intent provides a focus on determining if hatchery-​released fish can enhance stocks of wild species through increased hatchery production of fish, and the monitoring of fisheries to assess hatchery contributions (FGC § 6590). The ultimate goal of the OREHP legislation has been, however, “to enhance populations of marine finfish species important to California for their sport and commercial fishing value.”1 The legislative intent was used to craft a “primary goal” for the OREHP, which is “to evaluate the economic and ecological feasibility of releasing hatchery-reared fish to restore depleted, native, marine fish populations to a higher, sustainable level.”1,2 The original objectives developed to achieve this OREHP primary goal were to: 1. Develop and implement hatchery operation and growout methods that provide a supply of healthy and vigorous fish. 2. Conduct the replenishment program in a manner that will avoid any significant environmental impacts resulting from operation of either the hatchery or pen rearing facilities. 3. Maintain and assess a broodstock management plan that results in progeny being released that have genotypic diversity very similar to that of the wild population. 4. Quantify contributions to the standing stock in definitive terms by tagging fish prior to release and assessing their survival in the field. 5. Continue to develop, evaluate, and refine hatchery operations to maximize the potential for achieving the goal of the program. 6. Develop quantitative measures of success. With guidance from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), CASG created a 9-member Science Advisory Committee (SAC), comprised of scientists from around the country who were responsible for evaluating the program. The SAC, appointed by the CDFW Director, included members with demonstrated expertise in a wide variety of disciplines, including aquaculture, fish pathology, population dynamics, genetics, and water quality. Comprehensive and rigorous evaluations of marine enhancement programs are, in general, lacking, making this thorough and detailed evaluation one of the first of its kind."
