9,Abstract:,"Environmental influences on recruitment are usually detected by correlation analysis using environmental and recruitment data. When recruitment data are unavailable, abundance data are sometimes used instead. Computing correlations using abundance data instead of recruitment data can change both the magnitude of computed correlation coefficients and the computed significance levels. This effect is explained here and two approaches for recovering correlations between the environment and recruitment from environmental and abundance time series are examined."
