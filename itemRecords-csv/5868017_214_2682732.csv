22,Abstract:,"This symposium proceedings compiles worldwide expertise in spatial features of marine population dynamics, spatial fisheries management applications, and technological advances in spatial fisheries research and management. Thirty-five peer-reviewed articles feature research in analytical tools, modeling, life history patterns, distribution, physical environment, species interactions, fisheries patterns, and marine protected areas. The symposium was held in Anchorage, Alaska in October 1999."
