9,Abstract:,"Early reports of the eclosion process in invertebrates were often incidental to embryological or life-history studies and, as a consequence, were often made with a lack of careful attention to details. It has often been assumed that crustacean prelarvae escaped from their eggs by mechanical means; however, the actual mechanism has been a subject of debate. The purpose of this paper is to examine the development of the caudal spines and setae during both pre- and early posthatch periods, and to investigate their role in the eclosion process in the penaeid ""Sicyonia ingentis""."
