13,Abstract:,"Extracts of marine invertebrates collected in Palau were tested using an assay for the inhibition of proliferation of arthritic cells. Arthritis is a general term for inflammation of the joints, with rheumatoid arthritis being one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis. The crude methanolic extract of the reddish brown encrusting sponge ""Plakortis lita"" displayed activity in this assay. Further analysis yielded new carboxylic acids, ""homo""- plakotenin, the sodium salt of ""homo""-​plakotenin, the sodium salt of ""nor""-​plakotenin, the sodium salt of plakotenin, and the known compound plakotenin."
