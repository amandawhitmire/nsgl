11,Abstract:,"Traditionally, almost all albacore, ""Thunnus alalunga"", produced on the U. S. west coast has been canned; in order to develop alternative markets, the albacore harvesting industry has recognized the need to improve handling of products for fresh markets. The objectives of this study were to determine effects of onboard handling techniques and chilling methods on fresh albacore quality and storage life under controlled handling and storage conditions, and to determine appropriate objective indicators of storage life."
