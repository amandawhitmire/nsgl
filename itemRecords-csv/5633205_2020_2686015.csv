12,Abstract:,"Anthropogenical​ly induced global climate change is likely to have a major impact on marine ecosystems, affecting both bio-diversity and productivity. These changes will, in turn, have a large impact on humankind's interactions with the sea. By examining the effects of past climate changes on the ocean, as well as by determining how shifts in physical parameters of the ocean may affect physiology, biochemistry and community interactions, scientists are beginning to explore the possible effects of global climate change on marine biota. This review combines predictions derived from atmosphere-​ocean modeling with descriptions of the effects of both paleoclimatolog​ical temperature change and more recent transitory climatic effects such as El Nino to offer a synoptic view of the expected effects of global warming on the ocean ecosystem."
