11,Abstract:,"Molting in crustaceans involves a complex interplay of hormonal stimuli. There appears to be an endocrine factor in the eyestalks that normally inhibits molting--a molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH). The authors have purified a peptide with MIH activity from sinus glands of the lobster ""Homarus americanus"" by reverse-phase HPLC, using molt cycle interval and ecdysteroid titer bioassays to monitor eluted fractions. This paper reports the complete amino acid sequence of this peptide, the first reported amino acid sequence of a crustacean molt-inhibiting hormone. This peptide also has significant hyperglycemic activity."
