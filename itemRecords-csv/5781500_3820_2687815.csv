12,Abstract:,"Vanadium bromoperoxidase (V-BrPO) has been isolated primarily from marine algae. Because of the abundance of halogenated marine natural products, and because V-BrPO can catalyze halogenation reactions, its' physiological role is thought to be in the biosynthesis of halogenated marine natural products. In this article the authors review the results of competitive kinetic studies which address the mechanism of halogenation and then examine new results on the pH dependence of the competitive kinetic studies as well as fluorescent quenching studies which can probe binding of organic substrates to V-BrPo."
