12,Abstract:,"In 1985, we held our first Sea Grant workshop on the taxonomy of economic seaweeds in Agana, Guam, with the University of Guam Marine Laboratory and Dr. Roy Tsuda as hosts. Seven volumes of articles published by the California Sea Grant College Program on studies and expansion of articles from this first workshop and ensuing workshops have resulted in over 1600 pages of expertly edited, well-​copyedited, first-class, prize-winning, and very useful contributions. We can be proud of these efforts. So, I hope that the participants of the eighth workshop thought of that accomplishment when they were asked to prepare their manuscripts and illustrations once again and to submit the materials for review when everyone (especially I)thought that the next time you saw the materials, they would be in a bound volume. It was not to be. The U.S. Postal Service delivered an empty carton to the California Sea Grant office. All manuscripts, illustrations, and diskettes were gone-lost in the mail system that had served us so well for 14 years. With considerable dismay, and sighing, I notified all authors of the loss. For some, getting new pictures to that ""strict"" editor in Honolulu was the hardest. It seems that in many countries, it is now particularly difficult and expensive to get black and-white film, and the original submissions that came with colored pictures were returned to the authors, meaning a big ""to do"" to furnish black-and-white pictures. We simply cannot publish colored pictures as they are prohibitively expensive. Although some publications Journals) now accept digitized illustrations (which can start with a colored picture), most of us do not have the proper equipment, or if our institution has it, we do not know how to use it. For that reason, I insisted on black-and-white photographs. We understand black-and-white photographs: we know how to evaluate their quality, and editors will accept them. The luckiest people were those who still do old-fashioned black-and-white drawings, like thosethat adorn the pages of the chapters by C. K. Tseng and Lu Baoren, and by Xia Bangmei. Those drawings translate for publication very easily."
