10,Abstract:,"Introduced ""Spartina alterniflora"" (smooth cordgrass) is rapidly invading intertidal mudflats in San Francisco Bay, California. At several sites, ""S. alterniflora"" co-occurs with native ""S. foliosa"" (California cordgrass), a species endemic to California salt marshes. In this study, random amplified polymorphic DNA markers (RAPDs) specific to each ""Spartina"" species were identified and used to test for hybridization between the native and introduced ""Spartina"" species in the greenhouse and in the field. Previous work identified competition from introduced ""S. alterniflora"" as a threat to native ""S. foliosa"". In this study, the authors identify introgression and the spread of hybrids as an additional, perhaps even more serious threat to conservation of ""S. foliosa"" in San Francisco Bay."
