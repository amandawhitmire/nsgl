12,Abstract:,"In this study scientists investigated the effect of progressive infection of the Norway lobster by ""Hematodinium"" parasites on the plasma titer of the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone as a possible sensitive indicator of stress. They examine whether these changes may be implicated in the altered plasma glucose and tissue glycogen concentrations that often accompany these infestations."
