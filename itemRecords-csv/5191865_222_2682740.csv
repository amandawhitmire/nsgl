10,Abstract:,"USC's commitment to applied marine research dates back to the early 1900's when studies on Santa Monica Bay water quality were begun. Through the years university faculty and staff have worked with representatives of the public and local industry to solve marine and coastal problems of importance to the region. The goals of USC's marine research program therefore paralleled those of the National Sea Grant College and Program Act of 1966, which called for the rational development of the nation's coastal, marine, and Great Lakes resources—devel​opment that balances maximum social and economic use with good management and conservation practices. USC joined the National Sea Grant Program in 1969. This report summarizes the eighth year of participation in this program. Some 19 projects were undertaken, 10 of which were research projects. They are divided into five substantive areas—Resource Development, Coastal Zone Management, Marine Environmental Quality, Marine Advisory Services, and Marine Education and Training. The following sections summarize the results of these projects."
