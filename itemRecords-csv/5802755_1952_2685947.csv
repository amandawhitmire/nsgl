11,Abstract:,"The effects of stormwater runoff on the ocean are of great concern in urban Southern California. Current water quality monitoring programs do not assess the effects of stormwater runoff on the environment. This executive summary reports on a three-year study investigating the impacts of urban stormwater on ecosystem health. Plume characterizatio​n, water column and seafloor biology, watershed types, and future recommendations are discussed."
