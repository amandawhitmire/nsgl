11,Abstract:,"Haloperoxidases are enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of halides (iodide, bromide and chloridae) by hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the halogenation of appropriate organic substrates or the halide-assisted disproportionat​ion of hydrogen peroxide forming dioxygen. Two classes of vanadium haloperoxidases are known: vanadium bromoperoxidase​, isolated mainly from marine algae, and vanadium chloroperoxidas​e from terrestrial fungi. A review of the structure, reactivity, and enzyme kinetics of these enzymes is presented. Kinetic and mechanistic studies of several functional mimics of the vanadium haloperoxidases are also presented, including peroxo-​complexes of vanadium (V) and other transition metal ions. These catalysts have proved useful in testing hypotheses concerning the role of vanadium in the haloperoxidase enzymes."
