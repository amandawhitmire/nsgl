11,Abstract:,"Near-threshold corrosion fatigue crack propagation rates have been studied in ASTM A710 steel exposed to air and ASTM seawater environments, both with and without cathodic protection. Crack growth rates were retarded and the threshold stress intensity range increased in seawater compared to air environments. The threshold stress intensity range increased further when cathodic protection of -0.8V or -1.0V was applied, with the -0.8V protection level giving the maximum retardation of crack growth rates in the slow growth regime. The results can be interpreted in terms of crack closure mechanisms, hydrogen embrittlement, and a new microstructural model proposed in this paper."
