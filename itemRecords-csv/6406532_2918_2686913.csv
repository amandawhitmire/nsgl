14,Abstract:,"The Boca de Camich estuary is located in the mouth of the San Pedro river, lower Gulf of California and it is situated in the coastal zone of the municipality of Santiago Ixcuintla in Nayarit State, Mexico. This place receives a considerable volume of fresh water and part of the discharges of residual water from Tuxpan and Mexcaltitlan cities. Although there is little water quality data, these discharges, including those coming from human residences in Boca de Camich represent an important source of potential contamination. Other point sources include agricultural activities, open air garbage accumulations, tourist activities and washing of boats with toxic substances. These compromise the water quality of aquaculture areas and the species found in them. Beginning in 1978, oyster culture (Crassostrea corteziensis) by the social sector has become an important alternative to traditional fishing activities which have been conducted by fishers in the Boca de Camich From their beginnings to the present, oyster culture practices have been conducted on an empiric rather than scientific basis, including the processes of spat collecting, fattening and harvest. Equally as unknown is the affect of water quality in shellfish growing areas to oyster health and the development of the oyster cultivation industry. The objective of the first stage of the project is to study the physical-​chemical parameters of the oyster cultivation areas and assess the water quality in the context of classification of shellfish growing waters and sanitation. This information will allow for identification of sites for depuration of oysters and other shellfish if sanitary risks are present. In this way, the productive processes related to oyster culture and harvest can be improved. At the same time, public training and outreach events will be held for topics such as financing, protection against sanitary risks, regulation, among others, that are associated with this activity, with the short-term goal of developing a manual of best management practices for this form of aquaculture. These activities will also be carried out in similar coastal communities, particularly those located in the wetland area of Bahia Santa Maria (e.g. La Reforma) in the Municipality of Angostura in Sinaloa State, Mexico."
