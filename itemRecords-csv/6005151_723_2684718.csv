8,Abstract:,"""Cryptosporidiu​m"" spp. are protozoan parasites that cause gastrointestina​l disease in humans and animals, and are spread directly by fecal-oral transmission or indirectly by fecal contamination of water and food supplies. In California, there is evidence of significant fecal pathogen pollution flowing from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems along the coast. To develop ecosystem monitoring and management strategies, the author tested the hypothesis that ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" spp. are detectable in nearshore filter feeding bivalves and in terrestrial storm runoff collected from fecal-impacted coastal ecosystems in California. The goals of this dissertation research were 1) to evaluate innovative detection methods for ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" spp. in bivalve and water samples, 2) to evaluate bivalves such as mussels and clams as bioindicators of fecal contamination with ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" spp. in marine, estuarine, and freshwater ecosystems, and 3) to evaluate farm management solutions to reduce the load of ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" discharged into downstream waterways from coastal dairies. First, innovative molecular and immunologic methods were evaluated for detection of ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" spp. in marine mussels (""Mytilus californianus"") and freshwater clams (""Corbicula fluminea"") using tissue spiking and tank exposure experiments. The most analytically sensitive detection method was immunomagnetic separation in combination with immunofluoresce​nt detection of oocysts in mussel digestive tissues. Second, field studies tested 4800 mussels and 600 clams from marine, estuarine, and riverine ecosystems along the California coast for ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" spp. Genotypes detected in bivalves included the anthropozoonoti​c ""C. parvum"" genotype 2, as well as the host specific ""C. andersoni"" and ""C. felis"" that are shed by cattle and cats, respectively. In addition, 2 novel ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" genotypes were detected in mussels. Third, a 3-year study evaluated the distribution of ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" on coastal dairies and the efficacy of various farm management practices to reduce the load of ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" oocysts in storm runoff. Calves were found to be important loading sources of ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" on the farms, and vegetative buffers were found to effectively reduce the load of ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" oocysts in storm runoff. In conclusion, ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" spp. were detected in terrestrial runoff and nearshore bivalves, suggesting that ""Cryptosporidiu​m"" spp. will be useful bioindicators of fecal contamination in ecosystem monitoring and management programs."
