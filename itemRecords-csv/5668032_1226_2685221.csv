14,Abstract:,"Domoic acid (DA) poisoning first became a concern along the west coast of North America in September of 1991, when over 100 brown pelicans and cormorants were found dead or suffering from unusual neurological symptoms in Monterey Bay, California. This was followed by another occurrence of DA poisoning along the coast of Oregon and Washington, in which humans were afflicted after consuming domoic acid-​contaiminated razor clams. The 1991 domoic acid-poisoning event in Monterey Bay was attributed to a bloom of ""Pseudonitzschi​a australis"". The objectives of this investigation were to identify ""Pseudonitzschi​a"" species affiliated with occurrences of DA in the waters of Monterey Bay and to document seasonal patterns and hydrographic conditions associated with ""Pseudonitzschi​a"" growth."
