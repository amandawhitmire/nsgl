11,Abstract:,"Little is known of the factors shaping sediment bacterial communities, despite their high abundance and reports of high diversity. Two factors hypothesized to shape bacterial communities in the water column are nutrient availability and virus infection. The role these factors play in benthic bacterial diversity was assessed in oligotrophic carbonate- based sediments of Florida Bay. Here the authors report on a study which comprises three components: (1) an investigation into the diversity of sediment and water column bacteria as elucidated by rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), (2) an experiment in which nutrients were added to enclosed sediment-water mesocosms, and (3) an experiment to determine the effects of concentrated, co- occurring virus communities upon bacterial community diversity in flocculent layer-sediment incubations as well as upon photosynthesis of protists. The aim of this study was to describe bacterial diversity in this environment using ARISA, and to compare the relative importance of nutrient addition and virus infection upon benthic bacterial diversity in a mangrove-lined coral rubble cay. The study supports the hypothesis that nutrient availability plays a key role in shaping sediment bacterial communities, and also that viruses may regulate the abundance of the dominant competitors and allow less dominant organisms to maintain or increase their abundance in a community due to decreased competition for resources."
