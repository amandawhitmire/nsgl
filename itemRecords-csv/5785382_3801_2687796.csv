9,Abstract:,"Alongshore propagating low-frequency waves related to the direction and intensity of the alongshore current were first observed in the surf zone by Oltman-Shay Howd & Birkemeier (1989). Based on a linear stability analysis, Bowen & Holman (1989) demonstrated that a shear instability of the alongshore current gives rise to alongshore propagating shear (vorticity) waves. The fully nonlinear dynamics of finite-â€‹amplitude shear waves, investigated numerically by Allen, Newberger & Holman (1996), depend on the non- dimensional ratio of frictional to nonlinear terms, essentially an inverse Reynolds number. In this paper, a weakly nonlinear theory, applicable to this ratio is developed. Limitations in the Allen, ""et al."" numerical model prevent the development of a side-band instability. The stability of the equilibrated shear wave is demonstrated analytically, and confirms that the Allen ""et al."" model correctly reproduces many important features of weakly nonlinear shear waves."
