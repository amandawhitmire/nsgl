12,Abstract:,"The cordgrasses in the genus ""Spartina"" have become model organisms for studying biological invasions from both ecological and genetic perspectives. Here the authors characterize 11 disomic loci in ""Spartina alterniflora"" that show promise for population studies and for studying hybridization events between ""S. alterniflora"" and ""S. foliosa."" Comparisons among invasive and native ""S. alterniflora"" populations showed that levels of allelic variation are lower in invasive populations. In addition, nearly all loci that amplified in ""S. foliosa"" populations and in a swarm of ""S. alterniflora"" x ""foliosa"" hybrids were polymorphic. The authors found that several loci amplified successfully in other ""Spartina"" species."
