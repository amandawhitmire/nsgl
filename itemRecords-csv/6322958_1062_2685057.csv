17,Abstract:,"Recreational angling is big business. A recent NOAA Fisheries survey estimated that saltwater anglers had an overall economic impact of $82 billion and generated more than a half a million jobs nationwide. Even in times of economic distress, people go fishing and are willing to spend their hard-earned dollars on items that they perceive as being superior in production results. Live baits have always been popular with recreational anglers. In commercial aquaculture, the most valuable species to culture may not be a food fish, but an ornamental or, in this case, live bait. There has been increasing interest in the potential for culturing different marine or estuarine finfish specifically for the recreational live bait market. To better characterize the potential market and identify species of interest to the recreational angling community, a regional project was conducted to gain a better understanding of the opportunities for using cultured saltwater products in the live bait business. Bait shops and bait dealers from New Jersey to South Carolina were surveyed to gather basic information on live bait usage, including species of preference, sizes, quantities utilized, and preliminary economic data. This presentation will highlight the results from the individual states and provide a regional summary of the survey findings."
