11,Abstract:,"Modified atmosphere packaging of fresh fish is used to market high quality products in some European countries. The potential risk of ""Clostridium botulinum"" growth in these extended shelf-life foods is still a concern, especially since toxigenesis may precede organoleptic spoilage. This paper presents toxigenic data from rockfish, salmon and sole muscle tissues inoculated with ""C. botulinum"" type E and stored, under vacuum and 100% CO2 at temperatures between 30 and 4 degrees C, for up to 60 days. Predictive formulae were developed to describe the lag time prior to ""C. botulinum"" toxigenesis and the probability of one spore to initiate toxigenesis based upon the storage conditions. Such studies will support safe exploitation of these packaging systems in the market place, and identify critical control points for potential product or process abuses."
