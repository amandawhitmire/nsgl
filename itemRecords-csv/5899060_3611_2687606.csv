17,Abstract:,"A guide for recognizing and reporting potential aquatic invaders, to prevent their establishment and spread. For the Monterey Bay region from Moss Beach to Morro Bay, this booklet describes two-dozen 'least wanted' invaders. These are species that are not yet present in the area but have successfully invaded other coastal regions, spreading rapidly and posing a threat to native ecosystems. Each profile includes a photo or illustration and a description of physical characteristicsâ€‹, habitat and concerns pertaining to invasion."
