10,,"""Global Heartbeat"" is a unique project that brings together young people and scientists through a partnering of universities, community colleges, research institutions, schools and aquariums. This environmental education program utilizes a special monitoring device in which the heart rate of crabs and mussels can be recorded under different environmental conditions to assess the ability of the animals to adapt to the environmental stress. This technology is referred to as Computer Assisted Physiological Monitoring, or CAPMON. The team of The College of Exploration (TCOE) and the University of Southern California Sea Grant joined together in 2001 to offer a unique program for high school students on the health of oceans and health of living organisms. Using crabs as biomarkers of pollution, the students conducted hands-on science experiments by monitoring the heartbeats of crabs. The Global Heartbeat Program can be used by high school science programs, aquariums, museums or any other science-based organization. It allows students to learn scientific methodology while using authentic science research tools. An online component is included that allows students to share data with other students at different sites and to compare data and results. The Program is working to develop an online crab heart beat monitoring database and is working with teachers to design a data entry model. Partners will develop their own sources of funding for purchasing or leasing the CAPMON equipment.
