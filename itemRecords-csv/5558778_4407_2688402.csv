10,Abstract:,"This brief report lists specific recommendations for future studies of elasmobranch age and growth. Factors suggested for incorporation in these studies are greater precision and accuracy in age estimates and new growth algorithms; larger size and range in samples; cross-â€‹comparison in growth studies and allowance for individual variations; use of tagging studies; new techniques for age determination, such as using lipofusion as an indicator; studies of calcification physiology; and the use of computer-aided image analysis, electron microprobes, and radiometric and stable isotope dating techniques."
