12,Abstract:,"Moorings and variably steered CTD mapping were used to study the temporal and spatial variability of physical processes and suspended particulate material over the continental shelf of the Palos Verdes Peninsula in southwestern Los Angeles during the late summer of 1992 and winter of 1992-93. Researchers identified four sources of particulate material that are associated with the water mass characteristics of the region. Terrigenous particles are most apparent during storm events due to runoff. Phytoplankton occur in areas where there is nutrient supply to the euphotic layer either from seasonal runoff or from ambient nutrients beneath the surface layer. Distribution of particles from the outfall effluent reflects the stratification and current variability over the shelf. The nearbottom turbid layer appears to advect seaward at times, indicating the potential for broader dispersion of particles from the shelf. The data indicate that much of the hydrographic variability in the upper layer is due to seasonal variation in insolation, air temperature, day length, and rainfall."
