11,Abstract:,"Epizootiologica​l studies of PKD (proliferative kidney disease) at a hatchery in California resulted in the examination of non-salmonid fishes in the water supply as possible sources of PKX. This report describes ""Sphaerospora"" spp. parasitizing non-salmonid fish and rainbow trout, ""Salmo gairdneri"", and discusses their possible relationship to PKX, the causative agent of PKD in salmonid fish."
