7,Abstract:,"In 1999, California was the first state to pass a law requiring the establishment of science-based, statewide network of marine protected areas (MPAs). What is an MPA? It is a special place in the ocean, similar to a national or state park on land, where people are encouraged to visit and explore, but where harvest of wildlife is limited. Around the globe, from Hawaii to Australia, in the Pacific and the Indian Ocean, and elsewhere, thousands of MPAs representing 1.8% of the ocean, protect marine life from the pressures of human activities. These MPAs consistently have more marine life, greater diversity and larger animals than unprotected areas outside of these underwater parks. In California the animals and plants that live in MPAs are allowed to grow and thrive, and to reproduce safely in protected habitats with limited fishing pressure, allowing marine life and the habitats they depend upon to recover from human impacts and to maintain their ecosystem integrity for future generations. MPAs foster robust populations that can withstand current and future threats from climate change and other factors. With diverse habitats protected, organisms can move between and among habitats as necessary due to life cycles, seasonal cycles, and ecosystem changes. In addition, many coastal areas have been important to native peoples, who have relied upon them for their livelihoods and spiritual values. Some MPAs protect this cultural heritage and site history; MPAs can protect these values and other sites of historical significance. Protection of marine biodiversity was one of the key arguments in creating MPAs. Marine biodiversity is the variety and abundance of life (microbes, algae, plants, and animals) found in the ocean. In this publication, students are introduced to some of the biodiversity found in our amazing California ocean waters and the science of MPAs (ie: life cycle, fish populations, and solutions) through interactive lessons. In the last section, students will discuss and identify ways that they can play an active roll in protecting our California coast and Marine Protected Areas."
