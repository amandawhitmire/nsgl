13,Abstract:,"The aquatic zoonotic pathogen, Streptococcus iniae, represents a threat to the worldwide aquaculture industry and poses a significant risk to humans who handle raw fish. Because very little is known about the mechanisms of S. iniae pathogenesis or virulence factors, we established a high-throughput system combining whole genome pyrosequencing and transposon mutagenesis that allowed us to identify several virulence gene candidates. In this study, we describe one of these candidates, pdi, or the polysaccharide deacetylase of S. iniae."
