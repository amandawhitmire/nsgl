12,Abstract:,"Dissolved-iron, which plays a critical role in controlling phytoplankton growth in the oceans, is available in two main forms: siderophore complexes and porphyrin complexes. In this study scientists compare the uptake of siderophore- and porphyrin-​complexed iron by eukaryotic phytoplankton and prokaryotic picoplankton (cyanobacterial​). Results suggest that the two plankton groups exhibit fundamentally different iron-uptake strategies."
