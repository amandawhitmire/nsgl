9,Abstract:,"In this study, the complete cDNA sequence of a new cytochrome P450 family, CYP45, is presented from the hepatopancreas of the American lobster, ""Homarus americanus"". The CYP45 is shown to be expressed only in the hepatopancreas of juvenile lobsters. In a series of Northern blotting studies, the lobster CYP45 is shown to be inducible by treatment with 20-â€‹hydroxyecdysone (20E), the normal endogenous steroid molting hormone, and by several typical cytochrome P450 inducers. Hormonal and xenobiotic modulation of lobster CYP45 expression provides a potential pathway for endocrine disruption in lobsters."
