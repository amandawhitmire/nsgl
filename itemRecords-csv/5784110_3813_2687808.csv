10,Abstract:,"Diverse cultural attitudes toward marine wildlife were examined in a survey designed to reveal individual knowledge, preferences, interactions, and attitudes about marine wildlife. The survey was conducted at a museum in urban Los Angeles. Results revealed aesthetic preferences for animals, as well as animal rights and environmentalis​t attitudes. Survey respondents support protecting marine wildlife, even when that support conflicts with human interests such as convenience, jobs, or economic needs. They are not tolerant of traditional cultural practices toward animals if such practices involve ultimate harm to wildlife or habitat."
