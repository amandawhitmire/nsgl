9,Abstract:,"In this project, the Delta Science Fellow compiled several years of airborne hyperspectral imaging data to produce detailed maps of the distribution of the invasive perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium) at sites in the Sacramento San Francisco Bay-Delta. From the maps, inferences were made about the habitats that attract this noxious invasive plant, facilitate its spread and are vulnerable to future infestation. The Solano Land Trust, a nonprofit that purchases land for preservation, is using the maps to more strategically and cost-​effectively contain existing infestations and prevent colonization of presently weed-free places."
