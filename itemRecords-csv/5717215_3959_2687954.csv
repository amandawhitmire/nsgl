10,Abstract:,"Nakamura et. al.(1991) have reported the isolation of halipanicine from an Okinawan specimen of ""Halichondria panicea."" Apparently, only the isothiocyanate was found in this sponge. This paper reports on the isolation of the corresponding isonitrile and formamide from a specimen of ""Axinyssa aplysinoides"" from Palau."
