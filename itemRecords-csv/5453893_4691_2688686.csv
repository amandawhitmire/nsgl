9,Abstract:,"In order to optimize the strengths and toughnesses of vanadium-â€‹containing steels, it is essential to understand the mechanisms governing the formation of the interphase precipitates and to predict their sizes and spacings as a function of transformation temperature. This paper re-examines current models for the interphase precipitation reaction and shows how a new solute balance model can be applied to explain many aspects of the interphase precipitation of vanadium carbide in ferritic steels. The model establishes predictive correlations between the interphase precipitate sheet widths, intersheet spacings and boundary migration speeds as a function of isothermal transformation temperature, and shows that the time associated with the interphase precipitate repeat of a period is a constant for each alloy over the temperature ranges studied. From a single intersheet spacing it is possible to predict the intersheet spacing and width as a function of temperature."
