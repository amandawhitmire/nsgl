15,Abstract:,"The chemical constituents of the colonial zoanthid ""Zoanthus"" sp. were investigated as part of a program to study toxic marine organisms from the coast of India. The colonial zoanthids, which occur as dense mats on intertidal rocks, eject jets of fluid when disturbed. If the spray contacts a victim's eyes, it causes tears followed by prolonged redness and pain. A preliminary investigation of extracts of the whole organism has revealed the presence of a series of novel alkaloids. In this communication we report the structural determination of zoanthamine (1), the first member of the new class."
