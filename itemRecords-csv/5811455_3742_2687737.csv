10,Abstract:,"A multixenobiotic defense mechanism has been identified and characterized in several marine invertebrates. To assess whether multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) functions as a defense mechanism against environmental toxins, studies were undertaken to determine the inducibility of the transporter by environmental toxins. Both MXR substrates and non-substrates appeared to induce MXR activity and protein titer in the gill tissues of the mussel ""Mytilus californianus"". These results suggest that MXR induction may be part of a general cellular stress response to organic toxins."
