12,Abstract:,"In a search for correlates and possible causes of the difference in recruitment success of Pacific hake of the 1981 and 1984 year-classes, the authors analyzed the distribution of preserved zooplankton samples from stations with and without larval hake in winter and spring of these two years. They also assessed the onshore/offshorâ€‹e distributions of larvae, potential for geostrophic and Ekman transport and overall survival rates. Cluster analyses of biovolume spectra led to the development of simple ratio of zooplankton size that statistically separated stations where larval hake were likely to be found from those where they were unlikely to be found. This biovolume ratio was independent of temperature. However, they found no property or process that might explain why the 1984 year-class was spectacularly successful."
