20,Abstract:,"This report was produced by the OPC-SAT working group and Ocean Science Trust on behalf of the Ocean Protection Council (OPC) and the broader community of California managers with the aim of: *communicating emerging scientific understanding of the ability of seagrass and macroalgae (kelps) to ameliorate ocean acidifcation (OA) in a California-​specific context, *summarizing knowledge gaps and opportunities for filing them through research and monitoring, and *providing guidance on next steps for the State as it considers future nature-based actions to reduce the negative impacts of OA in California and beyond. This report summarizes workshop (May 2017) discussion and provides synthesis and interpretation of emerging data and results from research and monitoring in progress."
