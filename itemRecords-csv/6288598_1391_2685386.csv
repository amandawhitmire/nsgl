20,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of local climatic variability on the biochemistry of southern Kaneohe Bay, Oahu. Intense or prolonged rainfall over the bay and its watershed generate pulses of nutrient- and sediment-rich freshwater that subsequently induce phytoplankton blooms and impact carbon cycling. Variable land-based inputs, boundary layer dynamics, as well as changes in water circulation patterns make it difficult to classify coastal waters solely as CO2 sinks or sources on annual time scales. This issue has been examined by various research groups, which have produced contradictory results, and has gained complexity owing to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to anthropogenic input. High frequency surface water data collection was carried out from instruments on our Coral Reef Instrumented Monitoring and CO2 Platform (CRIMP-CO2), which was first deployed in November, 2005. In addition, water column properties throughout the South bay were investigated through synoptic sampling. The ""La Ni�a"" event that occurred since the deployment of the buoy represented one of the wettest winter seasons in the area over the past 30 years. The results from the sampling of the major rainfall events during this period have been examined and contrasted, including one which lasted for over 40 days causing floods, triggering periodic sewage spills, and leading to highly turbid plumes extending far out into the South bay. Phytoplankton blooms and a drawdown of CO2 occurred following each of the major storm events, with pCO2 minima of approximately 228 to 280 μatm, causing the South bay waters to switch from being a net source to a net sink of atmospheric CO2. Wind speed, along with the extent of the CO2 drawdown, was found to be the major control on the magnitude of this sink. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations cause a greater difference between air and water pCO2 during the blooms, when bay water pCO2 is relatively low, facilitating air to sea CO2 flux. Sea to air flux varied between extremes of approximately +0.4 and -0.3 mmol/m2/hour during the winter season. Wind direction was found to strongly affect air pCO2, and therefore had a large influence on CO2 exchange. Regardless of the large deviations when the bay water acted as a sink for atmospheric CO2, the (southern) bay remained a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere throughout the winter season."
