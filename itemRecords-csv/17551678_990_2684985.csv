12,Abstract:,"We use a simple regulatory event study approach to evaluate hypothesized economic attributes of C alifornia commercial fishermen who remain as active fishery participants (“stayers”) following regulatory events that attenuate fishing opportunities. The attributes of greater revenue diversification from multi-fishery participation, ​ lower interannual income variation, and higher annual gross fishing income are hypothesized to distinguish stayers from those who leave commercial fishing after a regulatory event. We find consistent and (in many but not all cases) significant associations as hypothesized between these economic attributes of commercial fishermen and their status as a stayer or a leaver, with interannual fishing income stability being the most consistently significant. In light of declining numbers of commercial fishermen in California, and the importance of multi-fishery participation in sustaining those who remain, policy makers should provide for flexible multi-​fishery participation when designing fisheries regulations, where possible."
