13,Abstract:,"In vivo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a powerful technique for characterizing the sublethal actions of physical and chemical stressors in live, intact organisms. In particular, 31P NMR is ideal for observing perturbations to cellular energetics since critical metabolite concentrations can be measured non-invasively and in real time. The technique's versatility is illustrated here through two studies: the actions of copper in adult red abalone (""Haliotis rufescens""), and changes in energetically important metabolites in developing medaka embryos (""Oryzias latipes"")."
