16,Abstract:,"Ansamycin polyketides include potent antibiotic and anticancer agents such as rifamycin SV (1), geldanamycin (2), and ansamitocin P-3 (3). These natural product macrolactams are characterized by an mC7N structural unit biosyntheticall​y derived from the aromatic acid 3-​amino-​5-​hydroxybenzoate (AHBA), which is carboxy extended by multimodular polyketide synthases (PKSs) utilizing primarily acetate and propionate building blocks prior to macrolactam cyclization. Two ansamycin variations based on the AHBA-derived structural unit and incorporating either benzyl or naphthyl ring systems have emerged. As part of our ongoing efforts to discover and biosyntheticall​y characterize novel marine microbial natural products we investigated Streptomyces sp. strain CNH-189 isolated from marine sediments retrieved off shore of Oceanside, California. Herein we report the discovery of the new ansamycin ansalactam A (4) from a marine sediment-​derived streptomycete that uniquely contains a spiro γ-lactam functionality. Biosynthetic studies with stable isotopes further led to the discovery of a new, branched-chain PKS extender unit for polyketide assembly observed for the first time in this class of natural products."
