9,Abstract:,"The endocrine regulation of several important life processes in shrimp is reviewed. Hormones are chemical messages synthesized and secreted by an endocrine gland and released to circulating blood. Blood carries the hormone to a (usually) distant target cell(s) where the hormone alters that cell's physiology. Usually, hormones mediate long-term, pervasive physiological alterations, as opposed to short term, localized events that are usually mediated by the nervous system. Although the focus is on penaeid shrimp, by necessity other decapod crustaceans are discussed due to limited knowledge about certain aspects of shrimp endocrinology; this is especially true for molting. There is good reason to believe that data from other crustacean species generally apply to shrimp."
