11,Abstract:,"This report examines the role of Mg2+ in affecting intracellular egg calcium in ""Sicyonia ingentis"", using oocytes loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-3. External Mg2+ was found to trigger a Ca2+-propagated Ca2+ activation wave within the oocyte, and subsequent monitoring of oocytes revealed a second Ca2+ wave. To determine the relationship of sperm entry and meiotic maturation to intracellular egg calcium to changes, nuclear events were carefully examined during egg activation and fertilization."
