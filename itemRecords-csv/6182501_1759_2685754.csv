9,Abstract:,"Abalone are broadcast spawners, but as this California Sea Grant research is showing, fertilization is more than just random collisions between gametes floating in the vast sea. Biologists now know that red abalone eggs release beckoning ""come hither"" compounds that guide sperm. (Chemical signaling is part of mammalian reproduction, too.) Sperm navigate along gradients in these chemical clouds, similar to mountaineers charting their course with the help of topographic maps. Without chemical signaling, abalone fertilization rates would be lower and areas in which these unusual mollusks could live and reproduce would, therefore, be greatly restricted Such discoveries and more to come may help determine abalone densities, spacing and sex ratios for maximizing reproductive success. This information, it is hoped, will lead to better strategies for restoring the state's depleted abalone populations through ""outplanting"" of cultured abalone or translocation of wild ones."
