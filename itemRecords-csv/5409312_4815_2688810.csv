9,Abstract:,"Elasmobranchs have been aged using opaque and translucent bands in their spines and vertebral centra, but few reports have verified the temporal deposition patterns of these bands. The authors present information for calcium and phosphorus across vertebral centra of the tropical, nearshore gray reef shark and the temperate, pelagic common thresher shark. In both species, the number of peaks in calcium and phosphorus concentrations was equal to the number of opaque growth bands counted in either x-radiographs or sections of the vertebrae. Also, those caught in warm-water months had peaks, while those caught in cold-water months had valleys, in these elemental concentrations. Thus, electron microprobe analyses proved helpful in verifying the annual periodicity of band formation for two elasmobranchs from different habitats and geographical regions."
