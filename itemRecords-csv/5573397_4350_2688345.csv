11,Abstract:,"Marine sponges of the order Verongida are characterized by their ability to synthesize brominated tyrosine derivatives, many of which possess antimicrobial activity. Chemical modification occurs both on the side chain and aromatic ring of the brominated tyrosine precursors, giving rise to a broad range of biosyntheticall​y related compounds. Two new tyrosine-​derived antimicrobial metabolites, 14-​debromoaraplysi​llin and 14- debromoprearapl​ysillin, together with the known compound araplysillin, have been isolated from the sponge ""Druinella (=Psammaplysill​a) purpurea""."
