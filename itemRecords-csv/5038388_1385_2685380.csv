11,Abstract:,"Recreational crab fishing is a popular activity on estuaries in Oregon, Washington, and northern California. The author has worked out a fairly simple plan for building a home crab cooker. It uses strong materials and guards against a hot outer surface. It is not the only way to build a crab cooker, of course, but it's tested and is known to work. Some skill in acetylene or arc welding is called for. If you are not so skilled, find a welder who can handle the job for you."
