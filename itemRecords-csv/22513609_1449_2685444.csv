7,Abstract:,"Three experiments were used to assess initial capture survival, and short- and long-term post-release survival of line-caught (18 to 225 m) southern California rockfish following recompression. Initial capture survival of 19 rockfishes held in a live well for a 10 min period following capture was 68% overall (95% CI: 60% to 75%; n = 168). Two-day survival of 17 rockfishes following recompression in cages was also 68% overall (95% CI: 62% to 73%; n = 256). External and internal signs of barotrauma were not significant predictors of initial capture survival or short-term survival. The most significant predictor of short-term survival was surface holding time (logistic regression model: Χ 2  = 8.63, p = 0.003, OR = 0.95). Fish recaptures and 2-year monitoring data of acoustically tagged rockfish (n = 84) provided evidence of long-term post-​release survival of rockfish of at least 690 days."
