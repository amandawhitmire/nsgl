15,Abstract:,"We examined the role of individual size and origin (wild versus hatchery) to predation risk and marine survival for threatened juvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in a coastal California watershed. In this study, we found that individual size and origin were strongly associated with increased predation risk of steelhead by a generalist avian predator (western gull, Larusoccidental​is) and associated with survival to reproduction by tracking the fate of juvenile steelhead tagged with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Across six cohorts (2005–2010), larger steelhead (>170 mm fork length (FL)) experienced marine survival rates at least 60 times higher than the smallest individuals. Predation risk by western gulls was highest for intermediate-​sized fish (145–190 mm FL), which was at least ten times higher than the predation risk of the smallest individuals and four times higher than the predation risk of the largest individuals. Wild steelhead experienced both higher predation risk and higher survival rates than hatchery fish of the same size. Although gulls disproportionat​ely remove intermediate-​sized wild steelhead from the population, they also remove large wild individuals that may otherwise experience the highest adult return rates.Instead of focusing on population size alone, conservation measures could also be guided towards the recovery of larger and wild individuals, whose survival is paramount for population recovery."
