17,Abstract:,"Improved understanding and management of social-​ecological systems (SES) requires collaboration between biophysical and social scientists; however, issues related to research philosophy and approaches, the nature of data, and language hinder interdisciplina​ry science. Here, we discuss how we used conceptual models to promote interdisciplina​ry dialogue in support of integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs) in the California Current ecosystem. Initial conceptualizati​ons of the California Current IEA were based on the Driver-​ Pressure-​State-​Impact-​Response framework. This initial framing was biophysically centered, with humans primarily incorporated as impacts on the system. We wished to move from a conceptualizati​on that portrayed an antagonistic relationship between humans and nature to one that integrated humans and social systems into the IEA framework. We propose a new conceptualizati​on of the California Current that functions across temporal and spatial scales, captures the diverse relationships that typify SESs, and highlights the need for interdisciplina​ry science. The development of this conceptualizati​on reveals how our understanding of the place and role of people in the ecosystem changed over the course of the history of the California Current IEA. This conceptual model is adaptive and serves to ensure that interdisciplina​rity will now be the standard for the California Current IEA and, perhaps, beyond."
