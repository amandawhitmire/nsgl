11,Abstract:,"Although buoyant plumes have been intensively studied theoretically and experimentally, field investigations of wastewater plumes are comparatively rare. There exist large differences between laboratory-â€‹produced plumes and large scale ocean plumes because of disparities in spatial and temporal scales, and the nature of variable local currents and changing ambient density stratification in the ocean environment. This article discusses observations of the wastewater field from a large outfall system and the effects of local currents on its structure and dilution."
