10,Abstract:,"The gray smoothhound, ""Mustelus californicus,"" and brown smoothhound, ""M. henlei,"" are relatively small sharks abundant in inshore shallow waters off western North America. Age composition, age at maturity, growth rate, and longevity are among some characteristics that are not known for these species. The purposes of this study were to test methods for elucidating bands in the vertebrae for age estimation, and to determine the size and age at which reproductive maturity is reached. Age estimates were verified by describing centrum edge characteristicsâ€‹."
