9,Abstract:,"Conflicts between ocean-going tugs and commercial crab gear caused severe problems along the Washington, Oregon and California coasts in the early 1970s. Crab pots were fouling tugs and barges as they moved between ports, and the loss of crab gear was a severe economic problem for fishers. Through efforts by Sea Grant programs on the West coast, an agreement was reached between fishers and tug operators on areas where crab gear would not be set, providing lanes for tug and barge traffic. During its 30-year existence, the Crabber/Towboat Lane Negotiation Project has saved millions of dollars in gear and vessel repair costs for both user groups. The 2008 edition of the Towlane Charts is a result of discussions and final agreements between the two groups over a twelve-month period. Changes in the towlanes have been made only in the Columbia River area of northern Oregon, and southern Washington. All other lane designations have remained unchanged from the 2002 edition."
