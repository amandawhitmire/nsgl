12,Abstract:,The authors describe a novel random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) based technique to rapidly assess the overall success of treatments designed to induce gynogenesis. To test this technique they produced white sturgeon meiotic gynogens. A total of 108 putative gynogens of known parentage from four different experimental treatments were screened using RAPD primers which were known to generate sire-specific markers. This simple RAPD-based technique could be generally applicable for the verification of gynogenesis or androgenesis in other species. They also determined the ploidy of sturgeon by using a Coulter Counter to analyze erythrocyte nuclei size and verified the results with flow cytometry. The technique proved to be rapid and accurate.
