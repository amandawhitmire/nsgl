11,Abstract:,"Differences in key biological processes, such as growth and reproduction, can greatly influence localized population dynamics. Thus, it is important to characterize spatial variation in life history traits of harvested species to develop management plans that maximize fishery sustainability.â€‹ We estimated sex- and region-specific growth, total mortality, and reproductive seasonality to assess biogeographic differences in California Halibut life history. We found that central California Halibut grew faster but attained smaller maximum sizes than those from southern California. Catch curve analysis illustrated no difference in total mortality by sex or region, though females lived longer than males. Year-class frequency distributions suggested greater recruitment variability in central California, where abiotic factors (e.g., upwelling strength, sea surface temperature) are likely drivers. Reproductive data indicated that summer spawning seasons peak earliest in Mexico, followed by southern and central California. These results demonstrate a need to assess and manage California Halibut at the regional scale."
