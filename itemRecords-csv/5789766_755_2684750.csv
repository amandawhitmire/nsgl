12,Abstract:,"In California, the sea urchin ""Strongylocentr​otus franciscanus"" is a commercially and ecologically important species. The sea urchin grows relatively slowly and exhibits variable growth. The nutritional requirements for its growth are not known. Adequate interpretation of the nutritional quality of a feed requires knowledge, not only of the feed's composition, but the response of the animal in terms of feeding, absorption, and assimilation. In this paper, the authors evaluate responses in small ""S. franciscanus"" to protein concentration."
