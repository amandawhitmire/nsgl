10,Abstract:,"Welcome to the second issue of the Coho Monitor. The Russian River Coho Salmon Captive Broodstock Program is possible because of the partnerships and the contributions that each member makes. This is particularly true for the cooperation and participation of private landowners within the Russian River tributary streams where young coho are being released and monitored. This issue illustrates the ongoing collaboration, with contributions from Warms Springs Hatchery, California Department of Fish and Game, NOAA?s National Marine Fisheries Service, Bodega Marine Laboratory, Sonoma County Water Agency, Trout Unlimited and others. Program partners have completed the third year of releases and have monitored winter and summer survival of released coho for two seasons. This fall will mark the anticipated return of the first release group as adults. A great deal has been learned in a short time leading to improvements for the program in the hatchery and in the field. The stories in this issue are provided to share those lessons and improvements. We hope you enjoy learning more about the program and look forward to your comments and thoughts as the program progresses. (Production of this newsletter is made possible with support from the California Department of Fish and Game Fisheries Restoration Grant Program and the County of Sonoma.)"
