12,Abstract:,"A model that accurately simulates surf zone waves, mean currents, and low‐frequ​ency eddies is required to diagnose the mechanisms of surf zone tracer transport and dispersion. In this paper, a wave‐reso​lving time‐depe​ndent Boussinesq model is compared with waves and currents observed during five surf zone dye release experiments. In a companion paper, Clark et al. (2011) compare a coupled tracer model to the dye plume observations. The Boussinesq model uses observed bathymetry and incident random, directionally spread waves. For all five releases, the model generally reproduces the observed cross‐sho​re evolution of significant wave height, mean wave angle, bulk directional spread, mean alongshore current, and the frequency‐​;dependent sea surface elevation spectra and directional moments. The largest errors are near the shoreline where the bathymetry is most uncertain. The model also reproduces the observed cross‐sho​re structure of rotational velocities in the infragravity (0.004 < f < 0.03 Hz) and very low frequency (VLF) (0.001 < f < 0.004 Hz) bands, although the modeled VLF energy is 2-3 times too large. Similar to the observations, the dominant contributions to the modeled eddy‐indu​ced momentum flux are in the VLF band. These eddies are elliptical near the shoreline and circular in the mid surf zone. The model‐dat​a agreement for sea swell waves, low‐frequ​ency eddies, and mean currents suggests that the model is appropriate for simulating surf zone tracer transport and dispersion."
