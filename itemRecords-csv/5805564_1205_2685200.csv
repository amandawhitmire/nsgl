11,Abstract:,"The mission of the California Sea Grant College Program (CSGCP) is to maximize the contribution of universities and affiliated institutions to the wise use of the sea’s resources and the meaningful defense from its hazards through research, education, and advisory services for the benefit of the state and the nation. This plan outlines a vision for the program for the next four years and seeks to build consensus among the diverse constituencies served by the program. It will provide a framework for determining the most relevant priorities to address and important goals that can be achieved through marine research, education and outreach in California. While it is useful to prioritize the issues identified in this plan, prioritization might lead to the exclusion of innovative, high-risk, high-potential research. As a result, the strategic plan for each of the subject areas is not stated in terms of a strict prioritization, but rather includes a comprehensive list of projects that are relevant to current needs. The chapters that follow explain in detail the plans for each subject area (in alphabetical order), as well as the plans for the extension, communications and management components of the program."
