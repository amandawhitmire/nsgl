12,Abstract:,"A comprehensive inventory of geological and geophysical data related to the nature and distribution of heavy mineral placer deposits of the southern Washington, Oregon and northern California continental shelves and coastal region was compiled in this study. The beach and coastal terrace deposits contain such strategic and economic minerals and metals as chromite, ilmenite (titanium), zirconium, and gold which are believed to occur within the continental shelf deposits of this region. The inventory consists of four components: (1) text summary, (2) one degree latitude map sheets, (3) data base, and (4) reference or archive. A Long-range plan is presented which will serve as a guide to future research and exploration activities in the region."
