11,Abstract:,"A nested-PCR method was used to detect the occurrence of human adenovirus in coastal waters of southern California. Water samples were collected from 12 beach locations at mouths of major rivers and creeks. Human adenoviruses were detected at 4 of the 12 sites, coliphages at all sites, and F-specific coliphages at 5 sites. The presence of human adenovirus was significantly correlated with F-specific coliphage. The bacterial indicators (total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and enterococci) were found to exceed California recreational water quality limits at 5 sites. However, this excess of bacterial indicators did not correlate with the presence of human adenoviruses. The authors recommend a reevaluation of recreational water quality standards to better reflect viral pollution."
