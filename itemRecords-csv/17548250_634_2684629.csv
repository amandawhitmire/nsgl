9,Abstract:,"Physical ocean climate indicators illustrated weak upwelling in the region for the early months of 2014, followed by anomalously warm water conditions. Sea surface temperature data were mixed, with some sources showing cold waters in the winter and spring (possibly reflecting localized conditions), while other sources (covering a broader area) showed warm waters throughout the year. Sea surface salinities were high through March, followed by average salinities for the remaining months. Sea surface heights were anomalously high most of the year, suggesting downwelling conditions and resulting in lower than average productivity. Weak alongshore winds confirm warm water conditions, and upwelling indices (like sea surface temperature) were mixed depending on the source, which could be confounded by localized conditions. Spring transition date was average. Climate variables showed average to warm water conditions. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) showed mostly average conditions for the year, with warm water periods (Mar and Sep). The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) values indicated anomalously warm water conditions for the North Pacific Ocean, while the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation showed average to less productive waters through the year. Biological ocean climate indicators echo results from the physical indicators. Starting at the base of the marine food web, we found phytoplankton abundance (as indicated by chlorophyll a concentrations) appeared highest during the early months, coinciding with colder waters; this was followed by low phytoplankton densities for the latter half of the year. The phytoplankton community consisted mostly of diatoms; this result is confounding, as this normally indicates productive ocean conditions. Zooplankton community composition results are not yet available for 2013-14. Results from 2011 reflect productive ocean conditions on overall zooplankton abundance, with increased zooplankton abundance compared to warm, poor productivity years (e.g. 2004-06), particularly for euphausiids and copepods. However, preliminary results from 2012 show a decline in zooplankton abundance. Intra-annual results generally show increasing zooplankton abundance in spring, peak abundance in June, and a decline in fall. Analyses of zooplankton samples show two main clusters: the first three years (2004-06), and the next six years (2007-12). Results on various mid-trophic level species are not available for 2013-14. Similar to the zooplankton community results, copepod community composition results to date indicate large increases in the abundance of boreal copepods (i.e., species from northern latitudes which are generally considered better prey based on their larger size and greater lipid content) during cold, productive ocean conditions. Copepod species common to mid-latitudes also became more abundant in cold water years, although not as dramatically. Equatorial copepods (i.e., copepods from southern latitudes which are smaller and have less lipid content) increased in abundance in the September cruises some years. However, declines in all copepods are evident in preliminary results for 2012. Within year results for the copepod groups generally showed peak abundances of boreal copepods in June, while the other copepod groups showed highest abundances in the fall. Pteropod abundance has remained relatively low throughout our time series, with significant increases in 2011. Euphausiid biomass results (as measured by acoustics) are not yet available for 2014, but krill densities appear to peak in late summer (July) in most years. Adult krill, which are larger and higher in lipid content than their younger counterparts, dominate the zooplankton samples during cold water years; however, with the arrival of the warm water conditions in 2014, the percentage of adult stages dramatically dropped in samples collected in July and September. The top-level predators in our region are represented by three resident breeding seabirds and two migrant whales. Cassin’s auklet, a zooplanktivorou​s seabird, was observed foraging close to SEFI in 2014; the average egg laying date was average for this species and it experienced high productivity. An omnivorous seabird species, the common murre, foraged more in nearshore waters and near SEFI in 2014, had an average start to breeding, experienced average breeding success, and fed mostly on rockfish. Brandt’s cormorants are piscivorous and were observed in low numbers near SEFI and in nearshore waters in 2014. This species had a slightly later start to breeding, experienced very high productivity (contrary to recent years of low breeding success), and consumed mostly rockfish species in 2014. For marine mammals in 2014, humpback whales were observed in higher numbers in the July and September cruises, and they were spotted near the shelf break, between SEFI and over Cordell Bank. Few blue whales were sighted in 2014; they were mostly observed on the shelf break in the northern part of the study region."
