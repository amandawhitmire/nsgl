11,Abstract:,"Since 1994, federal disaster relief programs have been implemented for New England, Pacific Coast, and Gulf Coast fisheries. The Pacific Northwest coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") fishery serves as a case study for results of a disaster relief program. Federally funded relief efforts included an emergency program that provided one-year assistance to an estimated two-thirds of the salmon gillnetters and trollers in Oregon, Washington, and California. A multi-year Northwest Emergency Assistance Program (NEAP) sought to reverse harmful habitat and capacity conditions and helped a quarter of the salmon gillnetters and trollers. NEAP was an important catalyst for programs to restore habitat, one of the primary causes of salmon stock decline. Interview, survey, and documentary data presented here suggest that disaster relief helped commercial fishers continue fishing but did not adequately meet many human needs for assistance."
