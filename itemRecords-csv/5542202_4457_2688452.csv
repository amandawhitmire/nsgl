12,Abstract:,"The influence of prolactin (PRL) in the control of hydromineral balance in freshwater (FW) teleosts is well documented; its role in salmonid osmoregulatory physiology is less clear. Prolactin appears not to be mandatory for FW survival of salmonids. Recent studies have revealed differences in the response of PRL during seawater (SW) adaptation among smolting salmon species and non-smolting strains of rainbow trout. The authors investigated the effects of salinity on circulating levels of PRL in a smolting species, the coho salmon, and how they might be correlated to cortisol concentrations and osmotic parameters. Results showed changes in salinity caused changes in circulating prolactin which were inversely correlated with internal osmotic pressure or natremia, irrespective of developmental stage."
