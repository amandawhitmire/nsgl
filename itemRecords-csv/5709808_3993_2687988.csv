10,Abstract:,"To aid in assessing the functioning of a constructed salt marsh and the adjacent natural marsh, the authors conducted a one-year study of epibenthic invertebrates using a new sampling method. Invertebrates were trapped in litter bags (5-mm mesh) filled with ""Spartina foliosa""; these were compared with bags containing other substrates (plastic grass, ""Typha"", and ""Scirpus"", all of which trapped fewer individuals. Invertebrate abundances differed by season, elevation, cover of ""Spartina"", and marsh type. There were more invertebrates trapped in fall than in winter; there were more in the lower than higher elevation, and in the natural marsh, there were twice as many invertebrates in areas with >80% cover of ""Spartina"" that with <20% cover. The strongest pattern was with marsh type. Natural, fully vegetated marsh had 2-3 times as many individuals as the sparsely-â€‹vegetated, 4-year-old constructed marsh."
