10,Abstract:,"The Visible Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR) aboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) was intended to provide frequent, high-â€‹resolution, visible and infrared images for monitoring weather events and thermal gradients over large areas. However, accurate cloud detection in GOES data over the ocean is a difficult task complicated by poor spatial resolution (4 km) in the GOES IR data, relatively coarse quantization (6 bits) for GOES VIS data, a visible sensing region of the spectrum not ideally suited for cloud versus ocean segmentation, and relative small oceanic signal dynamic range compared to that of either cloud or land structures found in a typical GOES scene. This paper reports an algorithm for cloud detection in GOES scenes over the oceans that provides a computationally efficient, scene-specific way to circumvent these difficulties."
