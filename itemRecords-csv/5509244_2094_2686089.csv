9,Abstract:,"Many people who gather clams, mussels, scallops, and oysters from California's coastal waters believe that red tides resulting from the presence of millions of dinoflagellates​, tiny one-celled organisms having both plant and animal characteristics​, cause these molluscs to be poisonous. In fact, most red tides are harmless. The dominant dinoflagellate in red tides along the southern California coast is the nontoxic ""Gonyaulax polyedra,"" which can, however, be responsible for fish kills, because it removes oxygen from the water. Although the presence of a red tide is a warning that the molluscs may be poisonous, the absence of a red tide does not mean they are safe to eat. Because of their ability to filter large quantities of water, molluscs can consume enough toxic ""Gonyaulax catanella"" to become poisonous even when not enough of these organisms are present to form a visible red tide. How state regulatory agencies attack this problem, what precautions the shellfish gatherer should take, and what you should know about commercially harvested shellfish are described here."
