11,Abstract:,"Some marine organisms, such as the fouling alga Ectocarpus siliculosus, have developed resistance to copper-based antifouling paints.1 2 This adaptation may be evidence of an evolutionary process among ship fouling organisms.3 Resistance to heavy metals is a potentially important trait for invasive marine species, facilitating their success in invading disturbed, natural communities. For example, the invasive bryozoans Bugula neritina and Watersipora subtorquata can settle, survive and grow in elevated concentrations of copper.4 5 The invasive bryozoans Schizoporella errata and Tricellaria occidentalis also have a wide range of copper tolerance.6 In addition, copper contamination has contributed to lowering the numbers of some ascidians, or sea-squirts, that are less copper-tolerant and increasing the density of some polychaetes, or marine worms, that would otherwise be limited for space by the ascidians."
