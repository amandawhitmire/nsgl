11,Abstract:,"Few consumers realize that there are risks associated with eating raw or undercooked fish and seafood, just as there are risks associated with eating undercooked meat. Although the overall risk of infection by parasites in seafood is slight in developed countries like the United States, changes in dietary habits (especially the growing consumption of raw fish dishes) and the tendency to reduce cooking times when preparing fish products may well be increasing consumers' chances of becoming infected with helminthic parasites. This publication is designed to help consumers, health officials, and those in the seafood industries better understand possible risks, and to present easy, common-sense precautions."
