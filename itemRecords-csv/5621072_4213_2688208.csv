10,Abstract:,"This paper describes development and verification of a simplified procedure and computer program to estimate the ultimate limit state lateral load capacity of conventional, steel, template-type offshore platforms. The procedure is based on limit equilibrium analyses of the three principal structural components that comprise such platforms: deck legs, jacket (braces, joints, legs), and foundation piles. The procedure includes simplified analyses of storm loadings including deck wave inundation forces. Modification factors are introduced to correct the static capacities in recognition of the interactions of the transient wave loading and the nonlinear-​hysteretic structure characteristics​."
