10,Abstract:,"This symposium on scientific diving covered a range of topics; 23 presentations are included here. Among the offerings are 8 papers on training and research methods; one each on shark-human interactions and upwelled cold waters of the Pacific coast; several on production platforms removal or conversion, coral reef studies, and submersible observations, and a sprinkling of site- specific research reports."
