11,Abstract:,"An 8-week feeding trial was conducted in a commercial farm, using a randomized complete block design to determine the growth responses of white sturgeon yearlings to different feeding rates. Sturgeon were fed 0.5, 0.9, 1.3, or 1.7% body weight/day of a prototype commercial sturgeon feed. Percent body weight increase was significantly affected by the feeding rates, but feed efficiency was not. The optimum feeding rate of white sturgeon yearlings under the commercial production conditions was approximately 1.3% body weight/day."
