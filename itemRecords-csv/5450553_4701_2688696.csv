10,Abstract:,"A chocolate sponge, ""Spongia mycofijiensis"", collected from Vanuatu, became the object of an intense study because the liquid squeezed from freshly collected material rapidly (approx. 10 min) killed common tropical fish being held in an aquarium. Furthermore, its organic extracts showed anthelminthic activity. Two cytotoxic macrocyclic lactones, fijianolides A and B, were isolated; these are the first 20-membered ring lactones to be observed from a marine sponge."
