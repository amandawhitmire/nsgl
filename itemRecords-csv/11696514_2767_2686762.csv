13,Abstract:,"Improper disposal of pet and human pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is an emerging public and watershed health threat in North America. Research is limited on awareness and what motivates people—and specifically, pet owners, who comprise more than 60% of all households in North America—to make environmentally and socially responsible decisions regarding disposal of their pet and human PPCPs. We conducted an online survey with educational and veterinary pet owners in Washington, Oregon, and California to assess the current use, disposal, and drivers of pet and human PPCPs. Our research reveals that the majority of pet owners do not finish their pet and human PPCPs. Unused PPCPs are primarily disposed of in the garbage, to a lesser degree flushed, and the remaining are stored indefinitely, leading to future disposal issues. The desires to (1) minimize PPCPs in the water and (2) avoid accidental poisonings are the highest-ranked motivations driving proper pet PPCPs stewardship. The highest-rated solutions were more environmentally friendly PPCPs alternatives, easier access to PPCPs collection, and providing disposal information on product labeling. Understanding the drivers and environmental outcomes of this issue can lead to more-effective programs, studies, and policies on PPCPs use and disposal and help minimize further impacts on the environment."
