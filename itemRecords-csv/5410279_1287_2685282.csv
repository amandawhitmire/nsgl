9,Abstract:,"An overview of the currently available methods for predicting the response of nonlinear systems to general random excitations is presented, together with their relative advantages and limitations, with particular reference to ocean engineering applications. A new technique is described, and its results are compared to those of various existing procedures for the particular case. An application to the prediction of the surging motion of a tension leg platform in heavy seas is then provided. The surging motion probability density functions of the deviation with respect to its mean value and of the maxima are both obtained."
