11,,"The development of new technologies for improved control over those basic biological processes that limit the efficiency and yield of abalone production has infused new life into this nascent industry. While most U.S. development of abalone cultivation has occurred in California, recent efforts also indicate feasibility and interest in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Abalone grow well in Hawaii, but the absence of suitable supplies of kelp-type brown algae is a barrier to abalone cultivation there and in the eastern and Gulf states. Whereas the presence of large and protected populations of sea otters precludes ocean ranching of abalone in northern and central California, this potentially cost-effective method of cultivation is particularly attractive to new industrial entrants and the commercial abalone harvesting industry based in southern California. As the traditional, commercial abalone harvesting industry continues its transition toward mariculture-â€‹based seed production, planting, and sustained harvesting operations, and as new entrants into the field of abalone cultivation bring modern methods and needed capital into this developing industry, prospects for the profitable production of abalone in the U.S. now appear encouraging."
