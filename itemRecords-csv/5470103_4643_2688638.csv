12,Abstract:,"As part of a collaborative program to investigate the metabolites of marine organisms from Indian waters, the authors have examined the metabolites of the unusual gorgonian ""Isis hippuris""; in physical appearance, ""I. hippuris"" more closely resembles a soft coral than the familiar seawhip or sea fan gorgonians. Five new hippurins and a new polyhydroxylate​d sterol were isolated from a specimen collected at the Andaman Islands, India. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by interpretation of spectral data."
