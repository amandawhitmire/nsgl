11,Abstract:,"Monitoring populations of marine animals has never been easy. Yet nowadays, as global natural resources become ever more depleted, tracking our precious marine animal populations is vitally important as part of a program of ecosystem management. The Gulf of Mexico oil spill and its resultant effects, to cite one instance, highlight how accurate information about marine populations is paramount to the management of oil drilling and the promotion of healthy ecosystem recovery."
