9,Abstract:,"Closing fishing in one area, by means of a marine reserve, for example, can intensify groundfish trawling nearby, and this compression of fishing activity into a smaller area may reduce a closure's ecological benefits temporarily. In the long term, a reserve may cause minimal intensification of fishing in nearby open waters. Uniform assumptions about how fishers will respond to marine reserves, however, may misrepresent both their ecological and economic ramifications, as shifts in fishing activity are predicted to vary significantly depending on a vessel's homeport. These conclusions are based on a computer model developed by economist Mike Dalton, a former professor at Cal State University Monterey Bay, now with NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center, and ecologist Steve Ralston at NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center."
