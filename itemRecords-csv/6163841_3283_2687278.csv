10,Abstract:,"A large-scale revegetation technique to cover large areas and capable of reaching marsh interiors most affected by erosion is crucially important to successfully control widespread coastal erosion in Louisiana. Sea salt contaminates freshwater marshes and farm land with increased frequency because of seasonal hurricanes and other means. There are strong indications that marsh losses are highest where saltwater intrusion invades freshwater marshes. For decades, native coastal marsh plants have provided a natural defense against coastal marsh erosion but currently are unable to cope with the increasing pressure. In addition to developing superior marsh plants, a coastal plant development program at the Rice Research Station incorporates salt-tolerant traits into a breeding and selection process. The program involves two major marsh plant species, smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) and California bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus). Research is also being extended to Black mangrove (Avicennia germinans)."
