12,Abstract:,"Furanosesterpen​es, which display a range of bioactivity, are frequently isolated from marine sponges. Palinurin, a linear furanosesterter​pene, was isolated in gram quantities from a Red Sea sponge ""Ircinia echinata"". In this paper, researchers describe two novel microbial metabolites of palinurin, palinurine A and B, produced by the fungus ""Cunninghamella​"" sp. NRRL 5695. This reaction may be of significant value in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. The possible transformation of furans to amides through a biomimetic reaction is certain to have applications in synthetic chemistry."
