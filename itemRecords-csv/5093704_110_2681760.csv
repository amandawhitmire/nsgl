10,Abstract:,"The objective of the Coherent Area Sea Grant Program at Humboldt State University is, as the title states, the 'Development of the Living Marine Resources of Northern California.' This clearly indicates the emphasis that has been given to support the commercial and recreational fisheries of this region. To accomplish our objective, we are attempting to involve marine users and resource persons available in our area. We believe that through this cooperative involvement, the opportunity exists to identify, and solve, relevant problems. This is a report on the Humboldt State University Sea Grant Program September 1972 - September 1973. It describes the activities of the four research projects and Marine Advisory Program which received Sea Grant support during FY 72-73."
