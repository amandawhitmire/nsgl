11,Abstract:,"Very few alkaloids isolated from sponges have a beta-carboline skeleton. However, the pursuit of bioactive substances from the massive Indo-Pacific sponge ""Fascaplysinops​is reticulata"" has yielded unusual salts. Each has a sesterterpenoid anion associated with an alkaloid cation, and a new substituted beta- carboline arrangement is present in two of the three salts."
