11,Abstract:,"The California spiny lobster, ""Panulirus interruptus"", failed to exhibit appetitive feeding or locomotion in response to a low molecular weight fraction prepared from an extract of muscle of abalone, a natural prey. Excitatory responses were induced by single, low molecular weight compounds, but these responses were inhibited by suppressants which occur naturally in the muscle fraction. Results indicate that tests of single chemicals cannot always reliably predict the stimulatory properties of solutions combining even as few as two or more compounds. The stimulatory properties of complex odorants, including prey extracts, are best assessed by fractionating and then combining and testing the fractions in bioassays of factorial design."
