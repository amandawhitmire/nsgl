12,Abstract:,"In this report, we highlight some of the activities underway at California Sea Grant in support the goals of using advanced science and technology to increase aquaculture production, recover metals from polluted sediments, detect harmful bacteria in coastal waters, and conserve genetic diversity in threatened species. Outreach efforts are described to help government agencies and others use GIS to coordinate water quality and resource management plans, improve the quality of seafood, and educate the public on nonindigenous species. And, a few of the 40 or so graduate students are introduced that the program supports annually. In short, this publication describes just some of the contributions being made by California Sea Grant to the network's ambitious national agenda of marine science in the service of society."
