10,Abstract:,"RNA isolated by conventional guanidinium isothiocyanate methods from tissues of a mollusc (red abalone: ""Haliotis rufescens"") is largely degraded and discolored by contaminants. These contaminants are associated with inhibition of reverse transcriptase, prevent accurate spectrophotometâ€‹ric determination of RNA concentration, and impart undesirable viscosity to the preparations. A cold two-step method of RNA isolation was devised which provides high yields of full-length RNA templates from these tissues and elimates the discolored contaminant."
