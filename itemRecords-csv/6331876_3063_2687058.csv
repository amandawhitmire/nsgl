14,Abstract:,"Halogenases catalyze reactions that introduce halogen atoms into electron-rich organic molecules. Vanadium-​dependent haloperoxidases are generally considered to be promiscuous halogenating enzymes that have thus far been derived exclusively from eukaryotes, where their cellular function is often disputed. We now report the first biochemical characterizatio​n of a bacterial Vanadium-​dependent chloroperoxidas​e, NapH1 from Streptomyces sp. CNQ-525, which catalyzes a highly stereoselective chlorination- cyclization reaction in napyradiomycin antibiotic biosynthesis. This finding biochemically links a vanadium chloroperoxidas​e to microbial natural product biosynthesis."
