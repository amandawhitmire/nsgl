13,Abstract:,"Competition in the California Dungeness crab fishery is intense; eighty-percent of landings are made in the first month of the seven-month season. This study of fishermen's operating costs and management measures is intended to support discussions and decision-making about policy changes that may affect the economics of the fishery. The survey results presented here show that a majority of fishermen have favorable views of only two of twelve alternative measures (one trap-limit for all size vessels and daylight-only fishing). However, experiences in other crustacean trap fisheries around the world suggest that simply implementing these two measures may not significantly decrease total trap numbers fished or slow the race for crab."
