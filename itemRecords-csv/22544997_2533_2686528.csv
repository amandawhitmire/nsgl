19,Abstract:,"Change, adaptation, and resilience have emerged as central concerns in the study of natural resource governance.The mobility of fisheries makes them particularly dynamic and susceptible to long term drivers ofmovement, such as changing climatic conditions and human pressures. To explore how movement impactsresource systems, this paper presents a mixed-method empirical analysis of long-term geographic shifts andsocial response in the Northeast U.S. summer flounder fishery from 1996 to 2014. First, the paper describeschange​s in the distribution of summer flounder and the catch location of commercial fishing trips landingsummer flounder. This is followed by a description of the institutional context of summer flounder fisherymanageme​nt and a narrative policy analysis of the ongoing regulatory process. Results indicate significantnort​hward movement of both resource and resource users. Fisheries movement patterns are a result of bothecological change, and an institutional context that allows for some types of fishery mobility while constrainingoth​ers. Significant conflict has emerged over the distribution of resource access and benefits as these fisheryshifts occur within a spatially allocative, and relatively static management context. The analysis identifiescompe​ting policy narratives that have emerged to advocate for different forms of adaptation. Narratives offercontesting constructions of the nature and extent of locational shifts, and the fundamental goals of allocation.The differences in these narratives highlight how policy history shapes contemporary disagreements aboutappropriat​e response. This fishery serves as a case study for exploring human response to large scale, long-​termmovements of a natural resource."
