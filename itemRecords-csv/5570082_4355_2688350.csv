13,Abstract:,"Compounds of mixed biogenesis that are based on the farnesyl hydroquinone skeleton are commonly found in Dictyoceratid sponges and occasionally in brown algae of the genus Dictyopteris. Smenochromenes A-D are four unusual macrocyclic chromenes that can be derived by cyclization of farnesyl hydroquinone. The unusual geometry of smenochromene A gives rise to some unexpected spectral data. The sponge ""Smenospongia"" sp. also contains smenodiol, which is related to compounds previously found in this genus."
