16,Abstract:,"Bioremediation of industrial flue gas is an attractive option to reduce costs of biofuel production, supplying algae with CO2 necessary for growth while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Limitations to the “CO2 to algae to biofuel” process are imposed by the harsh conditions algae must survive while growing on flue gas. High concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx, primarily NO) in flue gas are toxic and inhibit the growth of most microalgae. Stewart and Coyne (2011) recently described a novel chimeric enzyme, NR2-2/2HbN, in the unicellular alga, Heterosigma akashiwo, that incorporates a 2/2 hemoglobin domain within a nitrate reductase protein. We have shown that increased expression of NR2-2/2HbN is linked to the removal of NO from culture medium by H. akashiwo cells. Results of our investigation support the hypothesis that this enzyme is involved in NO metabolism and is capable of converting NO to nitrate, which is then assimilated into algal biomass. During the production of biofuel from microalgae, it is estimated that 45% of energy input comes from the addition of nitrogen. Harnessing NOx emissions as a free nitrogen source would further reduce the overall costs of algal biomass production. Elsewhere, H. akashiwo has been identified as a promising candidate for biodiesel production. H. akashiwo is capable of achieving high total lipid content and produces high amounts of saturated fatty acids similar to palm oil. Additionally, H. akashiwo is a robust organism that tolerates wide fluctuations in temperature, salinity and nutrient conditions, in addition to surviving long periods under nutrient limitation. Together, these factors suggest that H. akashiwo may be an ideal candidate for the simultaneous production of sustainable biofuels and the bioremediation of industrial emissions. Currently, we are focused on the isolation and characterizatio​n of NR2-2/2HbN and are investigating the long term effects of a model flue gas on gene expression, photophysiology and lipid production in this species."
