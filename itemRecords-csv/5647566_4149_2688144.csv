9,Abstract:,"Phenolic materials are present in industrial and municipal wastewaters, groundwaters, sediments, and soils; they are also present in natural environments such as streams, lakes, estuaries, freshwater and marine sediments, marine microlayers, marine algae and humic matter from terrestrial sources. This study was undertaken to develop a relatively rapid, accurate and reliable method for the determination of phenolic materials at extremely low concentrations in coastal marine environments."
