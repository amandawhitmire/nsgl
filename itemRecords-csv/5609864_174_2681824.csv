10,Abstract:,"This volume contains the edited essays printed at the Coastal Ocean Space Utilization Symposium. Because of the broad geographic representation at the conference, discussions covered a wide range of topics, from land reclamation activities along the coast of Bangladesh to the marine policy issues raised by multiple uses of marine and coastal resources around the world's oceans. Papers are divided into thematic sections, including summaries of national efforts to protect and utilize the coasts, developments in the uses of coastal space, including the creation of 'sea cities' by means of reclamation and developing artificial islands, especially in Japan. Other sections discuss means to wisely manage the extraction of minerals in the seabed, increase fisheries resources, and utilize the vast energy potential of ocean waves, thermal gradients and winds. The development of ports and harbors, and issues concerned with the safety of shipping are covered, along with means for improving decision making about competing uses, environmental values and priorities for future use and protection of the world's coastal margins."
