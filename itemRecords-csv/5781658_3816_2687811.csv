12,Abstract:,"This study's objective was to examine the sex ratios present in gynogenetic and polyploid white sturgeon. The finding of a 1(male):1(femal​e) sex ratio in the diploid progeny and a significantly different ratio in the triploid and gynogenetic progeny supports the contention of a genetic sex determination system. The data do not allow the authors to distinguish between a dominant 'W' sex determination switch mechanism and an autosomal balance mechanism, or to determine whether the WW 'super'-female is viable. Viability is of commercial importance as such females would be ideal brood stock for monosex culture at caviar aquaculture production facilities."
