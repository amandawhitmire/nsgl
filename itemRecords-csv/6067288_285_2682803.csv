10,Abstract:,"Sustaining and conserving the nation's coastal and marine environments creates an array of challenges that require both technological innovation and active collaboration among scientists, policymakers, resource managers and a variety of coastal constituents. The University of Southern California Sea Grant Program embarked upon this strategic plan in an effort to allow it to chart a course that meets these challenges and anticipates the future. It draws input from broad regional constituents as well as state and federal priorities. We will continue to review and refine our goals and objectives to assess our progress as we follow the course we have set to serve the people of Southern California. This program plan is dedicated to Robert L. Friedheim (1935-2001). As Director of USC Sea Grant from 1980 to 1989, he recognized the important role that Sea Grant could play in addressing the problems of Southern California's ""Urban Ocean."" Dr. Friedheim served as an invaluable advisor to the program after his tenure as Director; his wisdom and his compass will be sorely missed."
