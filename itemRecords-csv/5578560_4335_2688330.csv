11,Abstract:,"The effects of hypoxia and pentachlorophen​ol (PCP) were investigated in red abalones using flow-through exposure and in vivo 31P NMR spectroscopy. In general, the metabolic effects of hypoxia did not change upon pretreatment with PCP; the biochemical interaction of the two factors was additive. PCP produced no additional effects with or without hypoxia; thus it does not significantly impact red abalones at currently measured environmental concentrations. Use of in vivo NMR allows measurement of the interactive effects of multiple stress factors in live aquatic organisms, allowing assessment of the actual environmental effects of pollutants in the laboratory."
