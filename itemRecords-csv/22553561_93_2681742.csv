The workshop was attended by sixty-seven participants representing a variety of stakeholders and emergency responders including county representatives and agencies, state and federal agencies, non-​governmental organizations, academic researchers, indigenous community representatives​, legislative representatives from Santa Barbara county and congressional offices, consultants, and private industry. The workshop goals were to: 1. Share lessons learned from the 2015 Refugio oil spill 2. Consider impacts of oil spills on public health and socioeconomic sectors 3. Examine opportunities for community involvement in oil spill response 4. Review best practices 5. Improve future preparation The workshop was structured in two parts to achieve these goals: a morning session was designed to review challenges and lessons learned in the 2015 Refugio oil spill, followed by an afternoon session focused on future improvements in oil spills, with panel discussions and breakout sessions on public communication, oil spill response, monitoring of human health and social dimensions, and a closing panel on oil spill prevention."
