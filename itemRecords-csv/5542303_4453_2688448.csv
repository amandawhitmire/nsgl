10,Abstract:,"Covalent intermolecular crosslinks in collagen are responsible for the stability, physical strength and mechanical properties of connective tissue. The low collagen content in fish muscle makes quantitative analysis of collagen crosslinks difficult. A method has been developed for the quantitative determination of reducible difunctional collagen crosslinks in samples containing as little as 0.5 picomoles of crosslink per microgram of hydroxyproline. The method is used to show that the difunctional crosslink composition of muscle collagen from two species of Pacific rockfish differs quantitatively from each other and from that of rat tail tendon."
