11,Abstract:,"As the ocean undergoes acidification, marine organisms will becomeincreasin​gly exposed to reduced pH, yet variability in many coastal settingscomplic​ates our ability to accurately estimate pH exposure for those organisms thatare difficult to track. Here we present shell-based geochemical proxies that reflect pHexposure from laboratory and field settings in larvae of the mussels Mytiluscaliforn​ianus and M. galloprovincial​is. Laboratory-​based proxies were generated fromshells precipitated at pH 7.51 to 8.04. U/Ca, Sr/Ca, and multielemental signaturesrepre​sented as principal components varied with pH for both species. Of these, U/Cawas the best predictor of pH and did not vary with larval size, with semidiurnal pHfluctuations, or with oxygen concentration. Field applications of U/Ca were testedwith mussel larvae reared in situ at both known and unknown pH conditions. Larvalshells precipitated in a region of greater upwelling had higher U/Ca, and these U/Cavalues corresponded well with the laboratory-​derived U/Ca-pH proxy. Retention ofthe larval shell after settlement in molluscs allows use of this geochemical proxy to assess ocean acidification effects on marinepopulatio​ns."
