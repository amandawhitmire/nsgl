10,Abstract:,"The hypothesis that postmolt size is predetermined at the time of epicuticle deposition was tested and confirmed. Three treatments, induced limb autotomy, eyestalk ablation, and space manipulation, were made on juvenile American lobsters (""Homarus americanus"") at different molt stages. In addition, the critical stage for autotomy to increase the molt interval and that for eyestalk ablation to decrease it were determined."
