10,Abstract:,"Rockfish represent one of the most important groups of species to commercial and recreational fishermen in California and the Pacific Northwest, but there is a lack of the basic knowledge needed to utilize and manage this important fishery, which faces serious problems relating to gear conflict and increased fishing pressure. A meeting was sponsored by California Sea Grant in April 1986 to examine whether this fishery should be the target of a concerted research effort by university, state, and federal scientists. Participants included representatives from government, industry, fishermen's groups, and academic research programs. The publication includes an overview of the fishery and an extensive bibliography."
