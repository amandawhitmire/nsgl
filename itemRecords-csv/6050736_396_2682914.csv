11,Abstract:,"""Recent Advances in Marine Science and Technology, 92"" is the first refereed publication of a series based upon papers presented at the fifth Pacific Congress on Marine Science Technology (PACON 92) held in Kona, Hawaii, 1-5 June 1992. A unique process was adopted to bring about this refereed publication: session chairs selected authors (based on presentations at PACON 92) and recommended their manuscripts for possible inclusion in this publication. Out of 205 PACON presentations, 47 papers were accepted for this publication. Papers dealt in areas of ocean sciences, technology, management and policy."
