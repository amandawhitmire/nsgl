17,Abstract:,"This article demonstrates a method for spatially and temporally monitoring in vivo the entire shell-formation process, beginning with the deposition of an organic sheet and proceeding through the various structures and growth transitions that comprise the biomineralizatiâ€‹on of gastropod molluscs. The authors describe the application of this methodology, by studying the in vivo growth of ""flat pearls"" to obtain detailed structural information about calcite and aragonite growth transitions in the shell of the red abalone ""Haliotis rufescens""."
