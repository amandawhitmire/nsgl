11,Abstract:,"The salt water culture of an ""Aspergillus"" species separated from the Indo-Pacific sponge ""Jaspis cf. coriacea"" has yielded two new chlorine containing polyketides, chlorocarolide A (1a) and B (1b). These compounds have an overall structural analogy to carolic acid whose biosynthesis has been intensely studied. The structures and stereochemical features of the chlorocarolides are reported. Also noted are the similarities of their butyrolactones to those of the litsenolides and mahubenolides, both derived from plants."
