11,Abstract:,"In early March 2019, the World Aquaculture Conference was held in New Orleans, Louisiana. Two of us California Sea Grant Fellows, Madelyn Roycroft and Josh Graybiel, were fortunate enough to attend for an immersive four days of aquaculture presentations, discussions, networking, and wonderful New Orleans food and music. We thought it would be worthwhile to share the insight and experience from this conference with the rest of our 2019 California Sea Grant Fellow cohort, since momentum is building to further develop coastal and offshore aquaculture in the United States and it will likely be a topic we come across (or continue to engage with) at some point in our careers. Part 1: Attending a conference; Part 2: U.S. Aquaculture Insight; and Part 3: CA Sea Grant Fellows Conference Survival Kit information."
