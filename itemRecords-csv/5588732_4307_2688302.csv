13,Abstract:,"The white sturgeon (""Acipenser transmontanus"") and other Chondrostean species are becoming important species in aquaculture. Unfortunately, little is known about the endocrine control of reproduction in these species. To study the neuroendocrine control of reproduction of the white sturgeon, two gonadotropins (GTH) have been isolated from sturgeon pituitary extracts and radioimmunoassa​ys (RIAs) have been developed to measure these GTHs."
