11,Abstract:,"The aquaculture industry in California currently produces farmed sturgeon for the food market. Sturgeon mature at an older age than other fish, and growers rely on the seedstock obtained by spawning of wild-caught fish. They started rearing broodstock in the early 1980's, and the increasing numbers of ripe females have become available for spawning. This report provides a brief summary of reproductive cycles in domestic white sturgeon and management procedures used by farmers."
