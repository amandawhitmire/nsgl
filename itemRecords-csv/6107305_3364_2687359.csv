9,Abstract:,"Rapid chilling at harvest can help preserve the quality of fresh fish. Since microbial activity is responsible for most fish spoilage, delaying the onset of autolytic reactions and growth of microorganisms gives the greatest extension in shelf life. ""Rested harvest"" and bleeding methods, high-pressure processing, and modified atmospheric packaging can reduce discoloration and the development of off-flavors."
