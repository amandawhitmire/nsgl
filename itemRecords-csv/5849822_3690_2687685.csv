14,Abstract:,"Researchers cultured cells from dissociated embryos of the Pacific oyster, ""Crassostrea gigas,"" and infected these primary cultures with pantropic retroviral vectors carrying the luciferase reporter gene and different heterologous promoters. Reporter gene expression mediated by the retroviral vector allowed the comparison of different constitutive and inducible promoters and will facilitate future studies of gene regulation and expression in molluscan cells."
