12,Abstract:,"Reporter genes have been successfully used to examine gene expression in chloroplasts of higher plants, and high levels of recombinant protein expression have been reported. However, in the chloroplast of the green alga ""Chlamydomonas reinhardtii"", there has been more limited success. The authors hypothesized that the inability to achieve high levels of recombinant protein expression in the ""C. reinhardtii"" chloroplast was due to the codon bias seen in its genome. To test this hypothesis, they synthesized a gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), optimizing its codon usage to reflect that of major ""C. reinhardtii"" chloroplast-â€‹encoded proteins. They then monitored the accumulation of GFP in chloroplasts transformed with the codon-optimized GFP cassette and compared this expression with the accumulation of GFP in ""C. reinhardtii"" transformed with a non-optimized cassette."
