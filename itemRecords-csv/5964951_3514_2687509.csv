13,,"Because of the high percentage of impervious ground surfaces found in developed areas, storm water runoff can frequently deliver high concentrations of pollutants to regional waters. Increasingly, developers and architects are playing an important role in pollution prevention. This report describes numerous procedures, protocols, structural devices, and site designs (i.e., Best Management Practices) that prevent or mitigate storm water runoff. These include source controls, which prevent pollutants from entering storm water; design considerations, which reduce both pollutants and runoff through prudent decisions regarding building materials, landscaping, xeriscaping, design of parking areas and the like; and treatment controls, which separate pollutants from storm water. The authors include illustrations of a number of Best Management Practices, and profiles of relevant commercial products, such as filters, drainage systems, roofing materials, and pavement alternatives."
