10,Abstract:,"The marine sponge ""Lendenfeldia frondosa"", collected from the Solomon Islands, has yielded homoscalarane sesterterpenes. Two new metabolites, epihomoscalaral​actone IIA and homoscalarate II, were accompanied by two known metabolites, homoscalaralact​one IIA and homoscalaralact​one IIB. One of these homscalaranes is moderately potent in an anti-​inflammatory assay."
