7,Abstract:,"The coastal rivers of Southern Oregon and Northern California are home to some of the best salmon and steelhead runs on the Pacific coast. Anadromous salmonids populations in these rivers include spring and fall Chinook (Onchorynchus tschawytscha), coho (O. kisutch), summer and winter steelhead (O. mykiss) and coastal cutthroat trout (O. clarkia). Each river hosts varying runs of summer, spring and winter populations of adult salmonids. The recreational fishing guide industry has existed on West Coast rivers for over 50 years. This industry is an important economic component within the southern Oregon and Northern California coastal communities. Thousands of anglers utilize guide services annually, providing income for hundreds of local and regional fishing guides. Significant increases in the number of salmon and steelhead fishing guides operating in Curry, Del Norte and Humboldt coastal streams seems to have occurred from 1990-1995. However, no directed studies were conducted to quantify these fishing guide industry demographics, use trends and economic impacts. Some of this increase may have been a reflection of job reductions in the timber and commercial fishing industries with partial transformation of these resource workers to river guiding."
