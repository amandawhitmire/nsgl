10,Abstract:,"Movements of lingcod implanted with acoustic transmitters were monitored for a year in central California. Half of the tagged lingcod remained within 5 km of coastline for at least 50% of days in the year, and 30% of lingcod were detected for >80% of the study days. Lingcod demonstrated distinct patterns in residency that were correlated to sex, fish length, and season. Residence times of females decreased with total length; female lingcod >90% maturity were present during the fall spawning season and briefly during the spring. Size-specific movements were less pronounced for males, but daily detections of males declined in spring, at the end of the winter nest-guarding season. The majority of lingcod detections were constrained to a limited area, however a few lingcod exhibited movements up to several kilometers. These results indicate that marine reserves can serve to both protect lingcod and also provide fisheries benefits via spillover."
