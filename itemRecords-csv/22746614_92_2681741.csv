18,Abstract:,"USC Sea Grant aligns its cross-cutting principles with those of the National Sea Grant College Program. In the course of implementing the 2018-2023 National Strategic Plan, the National Sea Grant College Program will strive to address two specific areas to enhance the Program’s capabilities in order to meet national needs: • Cultivate partnerships by integrating the expertise and capabilities of partners from the international, ​ federal, tribal, and state communities and from academia, non-​governmental organizations, local, traditional knowledge, and industry. • Enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion by seeking and welcoming diverse perspectives to enhance cultural understanding, and enable the network to pursue its vision and mission more innovatively, responsively, effectively, and efficiently."
