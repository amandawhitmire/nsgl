9,Abstract:,"There are many coastal and harbor hydraulic fills in California; these include sites of several airports and many major commercial and recreational land developments. When these hydraulic fills were constructed, their susceptibility to liquefaction was not recognized. Now there are analytical methods for evaluating the margin of safety of such fills for a given set of earthquake conditions. This paper illustrates liquefaction risk evaluation for an example hydraulic fill at Harbor Island in San Diego. The methodology described can be used to evaluate the probability of liquefaction hazard at any coastal or harbor fill in a seismically active area."
