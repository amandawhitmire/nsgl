11,Abstract:,"Skeletal growth anomalies (SGA) have been documented in a number of coral species residing in oceans worldwide. This condition of unknown origin affects the morphology of coral tissue, and likely affects calcification. Despite the alarming predictions and reports that ocean acidification will lead to reduction in calcification rates of corals and other reef organisms, very little is known about the calcification process at subcellular level. Even less is known about how deviations in cellular processes lead to SGA. Galaxin is a calcium‐b​inding protein found in corals that is involved in skeletogenesis and calcification. Calcyclin is a calcium‐b​inding protein that is involved in several cellular processes and has been shown to be up‐regula​ted during tumor growth and formation in several mammal species. We are employing quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR to compare transcription patterns of calcyclin and galaxin genes in healthy and afflicted Montipora capitata colonies. These data will allow us to investigate the roles that these calcium binding proteins play not only in SGA formations but also in calcification process of corals in general."
