12,Abstract:,"Researchers investigated the relationship between wave energy and seacliff erosion rates for nine coastal cliff sites in San Diego County, California. They compared high- resolution, long-term seacliff erosion rates to wave parameters (height, energy, and power or energy flux) in 10 m of water, the break-point, and at the cliff toe. Seacliff erosion rates range from 3.0 cm/yr in well-lithified Cretaceous sandstone to 43.0 cm/yr in unlithified Pleistocene sands. The wave parameters were calculated using the California Data Information Program Southern California Refraction-​Diffraction Model, an empirical relationship for breaking wave height, and a new term defined as relative power at the cliff toe. Findings suggest that waves, while an important mechanism of seacliff erosion, are secondary to material properties in the overall retreat of San Diego seacliffs."
