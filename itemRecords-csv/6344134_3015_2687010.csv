9,Abstract:,"Food poisoning can result from cross contamination due to poor food handling practices. Cross-​contamination occurs when biological or chemical contaminants are introduced into food through direct or indirect contact with raw foods, food handlers, or the environment. The vectors causing food poisoning could be through unsanitary work surfaces, utensils, hands, packaging, etc. Food handlers can prevent bacterial cross-​contamination from occurring by: separating raw foods from cooked, ready-to-eat products; washing their hands and using clean utensils tongs, scoops, ladles, etc. in-between working with cooked and raw foods; and, staying at home when ill."
