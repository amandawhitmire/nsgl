9,Abstract:,"This project examines the environmental factors affecting the survival of mitten crab zoea, in the hopes of better understanding patterns of Chinese mitten crab abundance in the San Francisco Bay-Delta region. The basic idea behind the research is that under optimal conditions, zoeal survivorship should predict adult abundance three to four years later, the time it takes for the crabs to reach adulthood."
