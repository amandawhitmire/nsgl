9,Abstract:,"This thesis starts with an introduction to Vietnamese fishermen working the waters off Southeern California from the ports of Long Beach, San Pedro, and Ventura. It includes information on how many fishermen are operating what kind of boats and gear from which harbor to target what species, as well as historical pointers and basic economic data. The macro setting of the political and economic environment that surrounds the fishermen, shapes their interaction with society, and determines the chances of their professional survival is examined. Key issues addressed include the prevalent logic of resource management approaches, the mechanisms that drive the translation of these approaches into federal and state policies and law and, ultimately, the difficulties of implementation and enforcement. The micro setting is examined via communal interactions among the Vietnamese fishermen as well as their encounters with the fishermen of other ethnic backrounds and the many official agents of U.S. government institutions. Finally, the thesis summarizes efforts to produce and deliver to its intended audience in southern California a safety training video (SCU-V-96-001) for Vietnamese fishermen."
