10,Abstract:,"Conserve Alaska's rockfish! This brochure has essential information for anglers to identify rockfish and decrease unintentional harvest. Recreational harvest of rockfish in Alaska has averaged about 90,000 fish per year since 1980. Rockfish are extremely vulnerable to overharvest. By educating themselves on rockfish-​conserving tactics, Alaska anglers may be able to prevent drastic fishing restrictions enforced from British Columbia to California. The third edition emphasizes release devices. The 4-color brochure is an ideal promotional item to give away to customers at charter fishing operations, bait shops, and seafood stores. Funding for this project was provided by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation as part of restitution funds to benefit the marine waters of Alaska."
