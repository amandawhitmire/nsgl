11,Abstract:,"The story of Tijuana Estuary (San Diego County, California) is complex. Ecologically, it has been influenced by its highly variable environment. Historically, it has shifted from a natural to a highly modified system. Politically, its fate has been hotly debated, and competing interests continue to influence its management. This report is an attempt to synthesize and interpret a growing database on the estuary's diverse biota--its vegetation, algae, birds, fishes, and invertebrates. Because so many changes have occurred in response to catastrophic events, the authors describe how each aspect of the estuary appeared before 1980 and how it has responded to several perturbations. There is little reason to expect that environmental conditions have stabilized or that new types of disturbances won't occur. Thus, this profile should be viewed as a stage in the process of understanding Tijuana Estuary. Like the estuary itself, our knowledge is continuously evolving."
