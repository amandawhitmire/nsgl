10,Abstract:,"The one-â€‹dimensional, time-averaged alongshore momentum balance between forcing by wind and breaking waves and the bottom stress is examined with field observations spanning a wide range of conditions on a barred beach. Horizontal currents were measured and bottom stress, wave radiation stress, and wind stress were estimated from other data."
