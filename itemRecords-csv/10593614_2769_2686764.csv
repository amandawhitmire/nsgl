13,Abstract:,"There has been concern in U.S. coastal communities that debris arriving on Pacific beaches from the 2011 Japanese tsunami and nuclear power plant meltdown was radioactive, despite little evidence of this. A study examined the ability of implicit dimensions of risk perception and explicit feelings to predict behavior relevant to tsunami debris. 44 visitors to a marine museum on the Oregon coast were given separate single-category IATs measuring distinct affective dimensions of perceived risk (danger/safety, afraid/unafraidâ€‹, dread/calm) towards such debris, similar explicit measures, and items assessing behavioral intentions towards tsunami debris. Results indicated that on average participants had weakly negative implicit attitudes towards tsunami debris, that explicit and implicit attitudes were relatively unrelated, and that the less informed people were the more negative their implicit attitudes. However, this was unrelated to an interest in gaining more information about debris. Overall, explicit attitudes predicted behavioral variables most strongly. The ability of different implicit dimensions of risk perception to predict behavior relevant to beach debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami was examined. U.S. coastal visitors were given IATs measuring three affective risk dimensions. Less informed people were had more negative implicit attitudes. Explicit attitudes predicted behavioral variables most strongly."
