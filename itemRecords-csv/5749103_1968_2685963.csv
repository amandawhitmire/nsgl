10,Abstract:,"Transportation of abalone in California and Japan before 1970 was typically done with the abalone either in buckets of water or in boxes with wet newspaper, burlap, or algae covering them. Mortalities ranged from 20-90% and resulted from improper handling and elevated temperatures during shipment. Since then, the development of techniques to transport abalone longer distances and to increase survival has been explored in both California and Japan. The major changes included the addition of pure oxygen and a cooling source to the shipping container. Today, abalone are regularly packaged and shipped domestically and internationally for commercial and research purposes."
