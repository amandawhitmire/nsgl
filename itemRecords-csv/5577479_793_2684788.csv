10,Abstract:,"Studies are underway to determine the influence of sewage outfall-​impacted sediment on the exchange of nutrients and trace metals in the California coastal marine environment. Utilizing a benthic flux chamber, researchers are collecting samples incubated in-situ for direct measurement of exchange rates. Preliminary nutrient flux measurements show that exchange rates are high enough to detect a 7-liter chamber over a 24-hour incubation period; trace metals (Fe, Mn, Co, Cu) will also be measured. Using a model, these fluxes evaluate the importance of sewage-​influenced sediments on chemical budgets in coastal waters."
