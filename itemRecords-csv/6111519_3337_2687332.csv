12,Abstract:,"The physical consequences of barotrauma on the economically important rockfish (Sebastes) were evaluated with a novel method using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in combination with image segmentation and analysis. For this pilot study, two fishes were captured on hook- and-line from 100m, euthanized, and scanned in a 3Tesla human MRI scanner. Analyses were made on each fish, one exhibiting swim bladder overinflation and exophthalmia and the other showing low to moderate swim bladder overinflation. Air space volumes in the body were quantified using image segmentation techniques that allow definition of individual anatomical regions in the three-​dimensional MRIs. The individual exhibiting the most severe signs of barotrauma revealed the first observation of a gas-filled orbital space behind the eyes, which was not observable by gross dissection. Severe exophthalmia resulted in extreme stretching of the optic nerves, which was clearly validated with dissections and not seen in the other individual. Expanding gas from swim bladder overinflation must leak from the swim bladder, rupture the peritoneum, and enter the cranium. This MRI method of evaluating rockfish following rapid decompression is useful for quantifying the magnitude of internal barotrauma associated with decompression and complementing studies on the effects of capture and discard mortality of rockfishes."
