11,Abstract:,"Marina development is increasing in almost all coastal areas, but especially on the West Coast. Local governments are interested in increasing revenues from mooring fees, and the local population supports marinas for the public enjoyment. The trend will continue: the amenities and the weather of the West Coast are suitable for the boat users with very little downtime. However, there is lack of research on how mooring facilities harm the marine environment and shoreline health as a result of oil spills, soap and waste discharges and other environmental consequences and the extent to which these are offset by regional economic benefits. The study examines these issues in Washington and California. This research seeks to analyze alternative mitigation and economic promotion scenarios for coastal development strategies. The policy goal is to find ways of reducing the environmental costs with minimal damage to the substantial economic and social benefits."
