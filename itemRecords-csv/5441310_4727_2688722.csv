10,Abstract:,"Inhibition at the rate-limiting step of eicosanoid biosynthesis, AA release, as well as the inhibition of both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways in inflamed tissues seems likely to lead to the successful suppression of eicosanoid levels and could result in an effective new type of anti-​inflammatory therapy. The marine natural product manoalide has been reported to inactivate venom phospholipase A2 from several sources and phospholipase A2 from polymorphonucle​ar leukocytes. In this investigation, the regulation of eicosanoid production was studied in both an in-vitro and in-vivo model."
