15,Abstract:,"Spore-forming marine Mn(II)-​oxidizing ""Bacillus"" sp., strain SG-1, is one of the better characterized Mn(II)-​oxidizing bacteria. The spores, not the vegetative cells, oxidize metals making this organism particularly promising for use in biotechnologica​l applications. Bacterial spores are naturally resistant to a variety of physical and chemical stresses which may be encountered in a waste stream or polluted environment. This study lists the properties of SG- 1 that make it an excellent candidate for bioremediation. Development of molecular tools in SG-1 now allows the protein-​mediated oxidation system to be genetically manipulated to further enhance the utility of the spores for metal removal and recovery applications."
