13,Abstract:,"On a sunny April morning, finding mussels at Pinkham Point in Harpswell, Maine, proved to be a difficult task. Water lapped against bare gravel and granite. Where once the rocks were covered with thick, black crusts of mussels, only empty shells washed up on the beach. Just a few, tightly closed live blue mussels clung to rocks and each other. Only one percent of the once-abundant mussels at Pinkham Point remain, according to a 2016 study by ecologists Cascade Sorte of University of California, Irvine, and Jane Lubchenco of Oregon State and others. They found that at sites throughout the Gulf of Maine, blue mussels have declined more than 60 percent over the past 40 years. This decline is reflected in the harvest of wild mussels, which has also declined: from 15 million pounds in 2011 to 6 million pounds in 2017, according to Maine Department of Marine Resources landings records. Why is there such a decline in the blue mussel population? Researchers cite fishing as a contributing factor. Other theories include ocean acidification and the predatory behavior of green crabs."
