12,Abstract:,"Marine ecosystems are complex adaptive systems with physical and biological processes operating onmultiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present an operational regional indicator for California’scon​tinental shelf system and investigate its skill in predicting a variety of biological responses acrosstrophic levels. This updated Multivariate Ocean Climate Indicator (MOCI) version 2 includes data that arereadily available from the Internet so the indicator can be automatically updated and shared regularly. MOCIv.2 is a simplified version of MOCIv.1, but it captures ocean-climate variability similarly. MOCIv.2 illustrates all major ENSO events that occurred over the past 25 years as well as the phasing and magnitudeof the most recent North Pacific marine heat wave, dubbed ‘The Blob’. It also shows differences in themagnitude and timing of ocean-climate variability in different regions off California. MOCIv.2 has skillin nowcasting marine ecosystem dynamics, from zooplankton to top predators, and therefore may beuseful in establishing bio-physical relationships important to ecosystem-based fisheries and wildlifemanagem​ent in California."
