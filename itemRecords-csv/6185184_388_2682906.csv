11,Abstract:,"Size-selective harvesting often targets larger individuals of a population and has been shown repeatedly to affect size structure, growth rates, the timing of maturation, and reproductive output. For sex‐chang​ing species, such as the California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher), selective fishing practices may alter additional traits such as the mature population sex ratio and the timing of sexual transformation. Collections corresponding to the peak of commercial live‐fish landings in 1998 demonstrated striking changes in the timing of maturation and sex change(compared to historical samples) at sites in Southern California and Baja California that depended on the relative intensity of recreational or commercial harvest. Recent sampling from San Nicolas Island in 2007 revealed a rapid recovery in size structure, sex ratio, and the timing of maturation and sex change. We are currently exploring, through analyses of age structure and growth rates, whether this recovery is related to management actions implemented in 1999 that were targeted to regulate the commercial live‐fish fishery and which may have coincided with a strong recruitment pulse. In contrast, the population on Catalina Island has not exhibited signs of recovery to historical sizes and sex change schedules and continues to bear the signature of size‐sele​ctive removals, which may be a sign of continued intense recreational fishing pressure. We also present data on spatial variation in life history traits of this species throughout the Channel Islands, which will be informative for future stock assessments of California sheephead."
