10,Abstract:,"Among the many invasions that have stressed coastal marine systems in recent years are the ""Caulerpa taxifolia"" invasions of the Mediterranean Sea, Australia, and the United States. This invasive alga has produced dramatic changes both in the biological landscape of coastal bays and estuaries and the political landscape of invasive species management. And though efforts in southern California in many ways represent a model of successful eradication, questions remained unanswered about the details of the eradication process and how the management, research, and education efforts there compared with similar efforts in Europe and Australia. This CD contains the complete proceedings of the international ""Caulerpa taxifolia"" conference held in San Diego in 2002, including the detailed results of group discussions and breakout sessions."
