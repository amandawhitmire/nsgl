16,Abstract:,"1 Introduction Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010, the federal government asked the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to establish a new program dedicated to funding and conducting activities related to offshore energy system safety, human health, and environmental resources. The new program became the NASEM’s Gulf Research Program (GRP), “an independent, science-based program that funds studies, projects, and other activities in the areas of research and development, education and capacity building, and monitoring and synthesis” (NASEM GRP, 2019). Activities focus on the transfer of knowledge within the Gulf of Mexico region and other U.S. regions where human communities, ecosystems, and energy production coexist. Furthermore, GRP’s Thriving Communities Initiative “seeks to improve the quality, accessibility, and use of information about how to protect communities from the impacts of oil spills” (NASEM GRP, 2019). For more information about the GRP, visit www.nationalaca​demies.org/gulf​. In 2017, GRP and the Health and Medical Division of NASEM hosted a workshop in Washington D.C. titled “Preparing for a rapid response to major marine oil spills: Protecting and assessing the health and well-being of communities” (Giammaria, Nicholson, & Snair, 2018). The workshop participants discussed research opportunities for improving public health preparedness, response, and protection associated with oil spills. They identified potential challenges and opportunities for communities to support preparedness and resiliency after a spill and recommended that GRP gather input at the local level.To address the need for local-level input and other recommendations identified in the August 2017 workshop, GRP collaborated with seven of the 34 Sea Grant college programs via the Gulf of Mexico Sea Grant Oil Spill Science Outreach Program. The outreach program’s team is comprised of staff from the Florida Sea Grant College Program, Louisiana Sea Grant College Program, Mississippi-​Alabama Sea Grant Consortium, and Texas Sea Grant College Program. They focus on synthesizing, translating, and delivering peer-reviewed oil spill science information for people whose livelihoods depend on healthy natural resources. With support from the GRP as well as the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative, the team led two workshops in the Gulf of Mexico region and partnered with the Alaska Sea Grant College Program, University of Southern California Sea Grant Institutional Program, and Virginia Sea Grant College Program to lead regional workshops in their locations. The goal was to gather feedback at the local and regional levels to identify opportunities to improve preparedness for oil spills. The five regions identified for this national collaborative effort—the West Coast, mid-Atlantic, Alaska, and eastern and western Gulf of Mexico—are all home to communities that have been impacted by oil spills. One workshop was planned for each region, focusing on three broadly defined topical areas—minimizin​g health, social, and economic disruptions after oil spills."
