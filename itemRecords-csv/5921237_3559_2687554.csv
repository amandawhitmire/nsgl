13,Abstract:,"Withering syndrome (WS) is a lethal bacterial disease of wild and cultured abalone, ""Haliotis"" spp., along the west coast of North America. In this research therapeutic treatment of WS was assessed using oxytetracycline (OTC) by injection and oral administration. Survival of OTC-treated red and black abalone was significantly higher than that of sham-treated animals, as were feeding rates. The authors also examined the depletion of the therapeutant in abalone foot muscle over time using a bacterial inhibition assay."
