9,Abstract:,"Jasplakinolide (jaspamide) is a novel bioactive 19-member macrocyclic ketide-​cyclodepsipepti​de isolated from the marine sponge ""Jaspis"" sp. Jasplakinolide has potent in-vitro cytotoxicity against tumor cells and in-vitro and in-vivo activity against the fungi ""Candida albicans"". Jasplakinolide was the first macrocyclic mixed polyketide depsipeptide reported from a marine organism and has been the subject of total synthesis. Here the authors report on its solution conformation using NMR, molecular mechanics, and dynamics calculations."
