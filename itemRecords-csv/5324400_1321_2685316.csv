12,Abstract:,"Water quality in Marina del Rey is determined by both the oceanographic conditions prevailing in the adjacent open coastal oceanic waters and the factors superimposed on those conditions associated with the rainfall, urban runoff and general usages of the marina waters. Due to the seasonal and annual variations in rain and runoff the pollutant load discharged into the marina and the resultant water quality also show strong variations. This creates an environment that is suitable only for organisms capable of surviving a wide range of salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen and the presence of a variety of metals and other pollutants. The limited measurements of metals and chlorinated hydrocarbons that have been made in the marina waters and sediments suggest that many of the water-borne pollutants may originate in deflection of storm flows from Ballona Creek back into the marina and in storm drain flow. The marina would be an excellent area for study of the impact of non-point source flow, but thus far such a project has not been undertaken. The present investigation began in July 1976, to study biological, physical and chemical aspects of the marina, which had not previously been undertaken. Thirteen sites were selected for establishing stations representative of the diverse environmental conditions in the marina."
