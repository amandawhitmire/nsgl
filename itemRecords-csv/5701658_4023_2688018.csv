10,Abstract:,"A real time, high resolution three-​dimensional acoustical imaging system for use in the ocean is designed to resolve biological behavior and interactions on the scale of centimeters to a few meters. As such it represents a bridging technology between large scale mapping sonars, and very fine scale optical systems. The acoustical system, Fish TV (FTV), is described in this article and measurements demonstrating its ability to track targets in three dimensions are presented."
