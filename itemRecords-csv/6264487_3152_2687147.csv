10,Abstract:,"Follicle-​stimulating hormone (FSH), produced primarily by the pituitary gland, is thought to play a major role in regulating oocyte growth and spermatogenesis in fishes. However, little is known about specific biological actions of FSH. A basic knowledge of FSH function is critical to understanding how gametogenesis is regulated in fishes and developing methods to reduce common reproductive problems in aquaculture, such as delayed puberty and poor gamete quality. The goal of this study was to gain a fundamental understanding of how FSH acts at the level of the fish ovary by identifying FSH-regulated ovarian genes and analyzing changes in sex steroid production in response to FSH. To examine time course effects of FSH, previtellogenic ovarian follicles of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were cultured with or without salmon FSH for 12-72 h. Culture medium was collected for estradiol-​17beta (E2) measurement, ovarian RNA was isolated, and the abundance of candidate oocyte and follicle cell mRNAs was measured by quantitative PCR. Medium E2 secretion was significantly elevated in response to FSH by 12 h and plateaued after 36 h. Messenger RNAs encoding steroidogenic enzymes, such as steroid acute regulatory protein (star) and 3beta-​hydroxysteroid (hsd3b) were significantly upregulated by 12 h, while P450 aromatase (cyp19a1a) showed no change in response to FSH. Other putative follicle cell transcripts such as FSH receptor (fshr) and lipoprotein lipase (lpl) were depressed initially by FSH treatment and later recovered to control levels. Putative oocyte transcripts such as zona pellucida glycoproteins, alveolin, and a C-type egg lectin showed no change over the 72 h experiment. Additional FSH-regulated ovarian genes were subsequently identified through construction of four suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries with RNA isolated from FSH-treated and untreated whole ovarian follicles, as well as follicle/inters​titial cell enriched ovarian tissues. Genes identified by SSH are involved in cell survival, growth and differentiation (e.g., clusterin, insulin-like growth factor 2), tissue remodeling (e.g., connective tissue growth factor), cell-cell communication (connexins), and transcriptional regulation (wilms tumor suppressor). As evident by the rapid and significant increase in E2 secretion and changes in steroidogenic enzyme gene expression within the ovary, we can conclude that FSH strongly influences steroidogenesis in the salmon ovary during previtellogenic growth and may be a critical signal for puberty onset. This is the first comprehensive assessment of the biological actions of FSH at the fish ovary. Discoveries may aid in developing methods to reduce common reproductive dysfunctions in aquaculture, including delayed puberty and poor egg quality.
