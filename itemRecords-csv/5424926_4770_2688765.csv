9,Abstract:,"Juvenile coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") were acclimated to seawater beginning at one of two stages of development. The first group was seawater-​acclimated before the 1- to 2-month period of elevated plasma thyroxine (T4) concentrations associated with smoltification; the second group, midway through the period of elevated T4 levels. Transfer to seawater before T4 elevation prevented the rise in thyroid hormone concentrations and reduced the response to bovine thyrotropin. Transfer of salmon during the period of elevated T4 levels did not change thyroid hormone concentrations; however, the response to thyrotropin was greater. The authors conclude that the longterm response of the thyroid to seawater acclimation is partly a function of the stage of development at the time of transfer."
