8,Abstract:,"""Three samples of ""Dysidea herbacea"" from Bowl Reef near Townsville, Australia were examined; one specimen contained the known metabolite dysidin and a new ichthyotoxic 9,11-​secosterol, herbasterol. The structure of herbasterol was elucidated by interpretation of spectral data. Treatment of herbasterol with either acid or base caused a retro-aldol reaction resulting in the formation of 19-​norherbasterol."
