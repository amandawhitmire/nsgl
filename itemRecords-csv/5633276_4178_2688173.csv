12,Abstract:,"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of temperature (23 and 26 deg. C) and feeding rate (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5% BW/day) on growth, feed efficiency, and body composition of 30-g-size white sturgeon. Body weight increase (BWI) and feed efficiency (FE) were significantly higher at 23 deg. than 26 deg. C when the sturgeon were fed at the same rate. BWI, FE and body lipid content were significantly elevated with increasing feeding rates. There were no significant interactions between water temperature and feeding rate for all measurements."
