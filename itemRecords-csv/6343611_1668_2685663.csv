12,Abstract:,"The purpose of the Fishing Communities Project was to provide detailed historical and current social science information on four Northern California port communities - Crescent City, Trinidad, Eureka/Fields Landing, and Noyo/Fort Bragg. In addition to profiling each community, the project also provides a regional overview that encompasses the three counties - Mendocino, Humboldt, and Del Norte - in which these communities are situated. While this report is intended to help address fishery management needs, it can be used in a range of processes, from local planning and education to state and regional policy issues. This regional overview provides county-level demographic and economic information, a discussion of fishery regulations, and customized summaries of commercial and recreational fishery data for the three North Coast counties and the tri-county region. The demographic and economic data contained in that overview illustrate the larger context within which North Coast fishing communities operate and adapt to change, and are also suggestive of how life in rural areas contrasts with the largely urban environment in which most Californians live. Each individual port profile provides the history of that community and its fisheries, present-day fishery operations, activities and associated infrastructure, and identifies key regulatory and economic factors highlighted by study participants that interact with and affect the local fishing community."
