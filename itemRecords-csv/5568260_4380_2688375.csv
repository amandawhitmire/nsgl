11,Abstract:,"When dry seeds, pollen, yeast cells, and anhydrobiotic microscopic animals are rapidly rehydrated they leak their soluble cellular contents into the surrounding medium, as a result of which they are often killed. This imbibitional leakage has long been known to be a major source of damage to the dry organisms, particularly if the imbibition is accomplished at low temperatures. This study indicates that the most probably cause of the leakage seen when dry cells or organisms such as seeds, pollen, or yeast cells are plunged into water is a gel to liquid crystalline phase transition in membrane phospholipids accompanying rehydration. Below the apparent transition, viable pollen shows low germination and high leakage when placed in water, but above the transition germination increases and leakage decreases. The apparent transition temperature falls with increasing water content, much as in pure phospholipids."
