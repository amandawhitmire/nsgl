12,Abstract:,"Baseline reproductive information is crucial to identifying species responses to spatiotemporal variation and changing environmental conditions. We collected 205central California halibut (2012 and 2013) to better understand the reproductive tactics of a batch spawner with indeterminate fecundity. We used histology to identify subphases of actively spawning fish, approximated spawning duration based on weekly proportions of reproductive females, calculated daily spawning fractions to estimate interspawning intervals, and quantified batch fecundity using the hydrated oocyte method.The spawning season lasted approximately 10 weeks. Interspawning intervals were 1.3 to 2.7 d, depending upon the spawning marker (i.e., hydrated oocytes orPOFs) used. Mean batch fecundity for fish in the late hydration subphase of spawning was 597,445 ± 318,419eggs, resulting in annual fecundities that ranged from5.2 × 106 to 8.1 × 107 eggs per fish. These findings provide a preliminary assessment of reproductive output forCalifornia halibut and foundation data for future spatiotemporal analyses."
