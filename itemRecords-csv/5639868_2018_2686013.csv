10,Abstract:,"Under traditional management methods, including limited entry, fishermen tend to overinvest in vessels and gear to compete for fish and often overexploit the resource. In theory, individual transferable quotas (ITQs) motivate fishermen to maximize their revenues (prices) and minimize their costs to earn the highest profit on their individual quota. ITQs involve the allocation of a share of the total allowable catch (TAC) to individual operators. The individual quotas can be a fixed quantity or a percentage of a variable TAC and can be allocated for specific time periods or in perpetuity. Usually, ITQs are fully transferable (buy, sell, lease) to allow operators to optimize their business. Other aspects of ITQs and how they have worked else where are briefly discussed."
