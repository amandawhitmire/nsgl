13,Abstract:,"This study characterized stormwater plume development and associated phytoplankton dynamics in a coastal marine ecosystem through shipboard monitoring. We focused on plumes within Santa Monica Bay, California (USA), a coastal system that is subject to rapid pulses of untreated runoff from the urbanized watershed of Los Angeles during the winter rainy season. The physical, chemical, and biological signatures of stormwater plumes were tracked over time after each of 4 precipitation events ranging in magnitude from 1.5 cm to 9 cm. Low salinity surface plumes persisted in Santa Monica Bay for at least 2 to 5 days over spatial scales of up to 15 km. This is consistent with a 6-day residence time for surface water plume parcels, which was estimated from a drifter trajectory in the bay. Shipboard sampling and salinity measurements in the surf zone showed that plumes often persisted even longer nearshore. Plume waters were generally characterized by higher concentrations of dissolved nitrogen, colored dissolved organic matter, and higher light attenuation than non-plume waters. The magnitude of the effect of stormwater runoff on phytoplankton dynamics was dependent on the size of each storm and subsequent residence time of runoff within the bay. Rain events led to increases in primary productivity, phytoplankton biomass, and specifically, increases in diatom biomass, as measured by concentrations of biogenic silica."
