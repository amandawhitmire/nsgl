11,Abstract:,"From the results of a 3-yr study of the vital demographic statistics of adult female Dungeness crabs in northern California, a remarkable picture of their life history is painted. In particular, strong size-dependence of molt increments, molting probabilities, fecundity and survival rates was found; such dependence was often unexpected. Among females exceeding 155 mm carapace width, fecundities were often low, annual molting probabilities were effectively zero, and annual survival rates were about 10%; these figures were far less than those for smaller younger adult female crabs. Based on these findings, and other bits of evidence, an argument for senescence among adult female Dungeness crabs is presented."
