13,Abstract:,"Unlike the case with modern teleosts, the presence of a dual gonadotrophin (GTH) system in chondrostean species is just being studied. Initially, it was believed that sturgeon possessed only a single gonadotropin that regulated all aspects of reproductive development. Radioimmunoassaâ€‹ys for two sturgeon GTHs have recently been isolated and developed by the authors, however. This paper presents data from several experiments which support the view that sturgeon, like modern teleosts, possess a dual GTH system reponsible for the regulation of gametogenesis."
