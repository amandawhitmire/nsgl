10,Abstract:,"Understanding the mechanisms by which environmental chemical signals, chemical defenses, and other chemical agents mediate various life-history processes can lead to important insights about the forces driving the ecology and evolution of marine systems. This paper reviews the scientific relevance of various topics within the field of chemical communication, such as feeding stimulants and deterrents, hydrodynamics, and small vs. large scale chemical signaling. The authors also discuss current knowledge and technologies, including known biologically significant molecules and a variety of instruments and techniques."
