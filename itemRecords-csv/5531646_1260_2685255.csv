10,Abstract:,"Present restoration and mitigation policies allow natural wetlands to be degraded or destroyed if other wetlands are enhanced or constructed in their stead. But there is considerable controversy over whether restoration efforts are successful in providing the habitat required for native species to persist in perpetuity, and whether such projects are contributing to the overall objective of maintaining regional diversity of plant and animal species. This manual presents recommendations for assessing the structure and functioning of coastal wetlands, with emphasis on salt marshes and tidal creeks, toward the goal of standardizing assessment methods. A case study of the Sweetwater River Wetlands Complex, San Diego Bay, California, is included."
