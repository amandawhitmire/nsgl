11,Abstract:,"This study was undertaken to examine the effects of fasting on modulating the IGF-​IGFBP-​growth axis in the striped bass, ""Morone saxatilis."" Changes in circulating IGFBP levels were assessed in relation to the influence of fasting on body growth, metabolism, and cartilage sulfation and mitotic activity. Results demonstrate that an IGFBP of low molecular weight is increased with growth inhibition in the fasting striped bass, suggesting that a teleost fish counterpart to mammalian IGFBP-1 may exist."
