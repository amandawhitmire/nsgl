9,Abstract:,Described in this study is a microphotometri​c method for identifying kelp zoospores from in situ plankton samples based on light-​absorbance characteristics of zoospore plastids. The author presents (1) absorption spectra for laboratory suspensions of zoospores from four dominant species of southern California subtidal kelps; (2) an identification algorithm to discriminate zoospores among species; (3) various cross-​validations; and (4) a protocol for distinguishing kelp zoospores from non-kelp cells.
