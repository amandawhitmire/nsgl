10,Abstract:,"The functions and mechanisms of action of pituitary growth hormone (GH) in teleost fish have not been completely elucidated. The long-jawed mudsucker, ""Gillichthys mirabilis"" (Gobiidae), is abundant, easy to maintain and recovers well from surgery. Studies were undertaken to investigate the role of GH in the regulation of hepatic GH receptors, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) bioactivity, and tissue responsiveness to IGF-I in this species. Because of its similarity to other vertebrate systems, ""G. mirabilis"" presents a good teleost model of growth regulation and of the functions and interactions of GH and IGF-I."
