10,Abstract:,"Despite a close similarity in the primary structures of prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH), there is much evidence to suggest an antagonistic relationship during development of hypoosmoregulat​ory mechanisms in salmonids. Plasma PRL and GH levels are normally inversely related during both smoltification and seawater (SW) adaptation, with PRL levels decreasing and GH levels increasing in both events. This study investigated the effect of simultaneously-​injected PRL and GH on short-term adaptation to seawater in ""Salmo trutta"" and ""Oncorhynchus mykiss"". PRL significantly abolished the seawater-​adaptive effect of growth hormone GH in a dose-related manner, and also significantly reduced the GH-induced stimulation of gill Na+ - ATPase activity."
