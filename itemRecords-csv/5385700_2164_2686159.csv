11,Abstract:,This report describes the histopathologic changes present in gill tissues from 44 channel catfish obtained during outbreaks of chronic branchitis in commercial fish farms in California. Large numbers of microorganisms with a morphology consistent with immature stages of a histozoic myxosporean are thought to be responsible for the severe granulomatous branchitis found in most fish. This is the first detailed report on the pathology of this disease in commercial channel catfish in the western U.S. Similar cases referred to as `Hamburger Gill Disease' or `proliferative gill disease' have been known to occur in the south central U.S.
