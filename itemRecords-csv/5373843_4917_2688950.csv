9,Abstract:,"Female lobsters attach fertilized eggs to ovigerous setae on the pleopods by a stalk. Often a large percentage of the clutch is lost during the 6-12 month brooding interval, especially in laboratory-​maintained females. We have compared the morphological characteristics of egg stalks from wild and laboratory-​spawned females and correlated these characteristics with egg retention. Data show that the morphology of egg stalks varies among laboratory-​maintained lobsters and that there is a strong positive correlation between abnormal stalk morphology and clutch attrition. We conclude that improper formation of the egg stalk is a major cause of egg loss in laboratory-​maintained lobsters."
