9,Abstract:,"Techniques for studying the mechanisms of chemical corrosion in fiber-â€‹reinforced plastics are of considerable importance. The most common analysis technique for studying chemical changes in polymers is Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. For polymers reinforced with graphite fibers, however, study of the matrix is hindered by the presence of the graphite, which strongly absorbs IR radiation in a broad band of wavelengths. The purpose of this study was to investigate the degradation of AS- 4/3501-5a graphite/epoxy composite material exposed to solutions of hydrogen peroxide. Evidence was also sought for degradation in high pH (up to pH=12) solutions."
