10,Abstract:,"Reliability theory has found widespread application in the analysis and design of offshore structures. A major challenge in such applications is to determine a minimally sufficient probabilistic description of the governing load and response variables. While these variables are often assigned Gaussian distributions, non-Gaussian aspects may be induced by nonlinearities in wave kinematics, fluid drag forces or structural behavior. Here non-Gaussian models are constructed from limited, easily estimated statistics: correlation coefficients and either marginal distributions or moments. Applications shown include moment-based models of correlated long-term environmental variables, such as significant wave height and average period, and of short-term wave elevations and forces. These short- and long-term models are also combined to predicts extreme wave levels."
