11,Abstract:,"This paper describes the use of age structure of seagrass samples to estimate survival and recruitment and then population growth rate. The authors explain that survival rate can be estimated from age structure only if the population is neither growing nor declining, so the age distribution is both stable and has stationary structure. They present examples of incorrect estimations that would result from this method in instances of growing or declining populations."
