9,Abstract:,"Selective feeding of copepods on heterotrophic protists over co- occurring phytoplankton may be very important in the population dynamics of both prey, especially if the phytoplankton are also prey for the heterotrophic protists. This study investigated feeding rates and selective feeding of the common copepod ""Acartia tonsa"" on mixtures of the heterotrophic dinoflagellate ""Protoperidiniu​m"" cf. ""divergens"" and the co-occurring red-tide dinoflagellate ""Gonyaulax polyedra"" and predation effects of ""A. tonsa"" on the population growth of ""P"". cf ""divergens"" during simulated red-tide and non-tide periods."
