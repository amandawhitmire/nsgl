11,Abstract:,"Water is usually indispensible for maintenance of the integrity of biological membranes, phospholipid bilayers and many soluble proteins, but it has now become possible to remove essentially all the water from many such labile molecular assemblages by drying them in the presence of certain sugars. The authors here review the current state of knowledge concerning which sugars are effective in this regard and also the mechanism by which the sugars exert their effects. Many organisms that possess the ability to survive complete dehydration contain large amounts of sugars, particularly trehalose, and their survival in the dry state is correlated with the presence of this molecule. It is shown that this molecule is particularly effective at stabilizing dry membranes, phospholipid bilayers, and proteins."
