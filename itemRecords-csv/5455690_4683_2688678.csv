11,Abstract:,The quality of fish maintained in frozen storage deteriorates at a steady rate. This loss in quality is a significant factor in the utilization of fish. Changes are known to occur during freezing in the chemical/biocheâ€‹mical composition of the fish; these are species dependent. Changes also take place in the structure of the tissue; these may be freezing rate dependent. Further changes then occur in tissue structure during frozen storage. In this study special microscopic procedures are employed to follow and describe the structural changes that take place in frozen stored fish.
