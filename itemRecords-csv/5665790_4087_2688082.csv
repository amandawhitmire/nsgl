12,Abstract:,"Although wave forces are not the dominant design criteria, wave action around the structure is a major consideration in the design of Arctic structures. Summer wave action experienced by the Tarsuit Island clearly demonstrated that the wave environment around a platform can be very severe and may inflict heavy damage to the structure (Myers, et al 1983). If the design is not properly carried out to withstand severe wave action the damage to the structure can be great. The local bathymetry, the geometry of any undersea berms or embankments, and the structures shape may lead to wave amplification around the structure, leading to overtopping, excessive spray, and scour of the foundation. This section addresses the following aspects of design, which are associated with the wave environment: (1) Wave action around structure and wave run-up (2) Wave erosion of foundation and (3) Wave forces."
