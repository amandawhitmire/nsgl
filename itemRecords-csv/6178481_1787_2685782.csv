9,Abstract:,"Rapid advances in DNA sequencing and our understanding of the molecular genetics of secondary metabolite biosynthesis have created new opportunities to improve the process by which natural products are discovered. In this poster, we will describe a TRFLP-.based method to generate a genomic fingerprint of the biosynthetic potential of individual bacterial strains. These fingerprints can be used to cluster strains into similar groups and identify those with the greatest potential to produce secondary metabolites of various structural classes. Phylogenetic analyses of cloned biosynthetic genes can be further used to predict the potential richness of individual strains and the novelty of their products. Genome sequences of two Salinispora species are used to demonstrate the utility of these methods while it is demonstrated in biosyntheticallâ€‹y unknown strains that the production of specific metabolites can be predicted prior to fermentation and chemical analysis."
