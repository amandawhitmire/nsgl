9,Abstract:,"Abalone are primitive large herbivorous marine gastropods with all species in one genus, ""Haliotis"". The reproductive cycle of the Japanese abalone (ezoawabi), ""Haliotis discus hannai"", offers an opportunity to elucidate the hormonal control of reproduction in abalone since the level of gonad maturation is quantifiable and repeatable. The relationship between water temperature and gonad maturation in ""H. discus hannai"" allows the level of gonad maturation to be quantified. The difference between the ambient water temperature and the biological zero point is summed daily, and this value is called the effective accumulative temperature (EAT). This study used the EAT to measure precisely the level of gonad maturation of the experimental animals and to correlate the neurosecretory staining in the cerebral ganglia with an exact level of gonad maturation."
