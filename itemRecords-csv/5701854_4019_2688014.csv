10,Abstract:,"The kalihinols and related compounds are diterpenoids from sponges of the genus ""Acanthella"" that contain two, and often three, isonitrile functionalitiesâ€‹. Members of this series of compounds have been reported to have antimicrobial, antifungal, cytotoxic, and anthelmintic properties. This paper reports the isolation of seven diterpene isonitriles from a specimen of ""Acanthella cavernosa"" collected in the Seychelles."
