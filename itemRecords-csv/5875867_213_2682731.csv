9,Abstract:,"The rapid expansion of the Pacific sardine and concomitant decline of the anchovy on the west coast of North America present an opportunity to assess the consequences of a major shift in the California Current ecosystem. To address the need for coast-wide cooperation in the collection and analysis of sardine data, and re-evaluation of data on environmental properties related to the sardine's expansion, an organized workshop and retrospective review was held on May 2. These proceedings contain ecologically and economically relevant papers presented at the symposium plus summaries of two workshops, entitled 'stock assessment and management' and 'ecosystem consequences.'"
