10,Abstract:,"Using chitinase produced by ""Serratia marcescens"" QMB 1466, the different mass transport and kinetic steps involved during chitin hydrolysis were studied. Experimental results show a system kinetically limited by the overall rate of chitin hydrolysis. This rate is linearly related to the concentration of enzyme adsorbed on the chitin particle. Adsorbed and bulk enzyme concentration were found to be related through a Langmuir type of isotherm."
