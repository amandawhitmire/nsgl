9,Abstract:,"This paper updates the review and includes new or previously overlooked studies that have attempted to verify or validate the timing of growth zone deposition in elasmobranch calcified structures. The approaches and combinations of approaches that various authors have taken to achieve the ultimate objective of age validation are discussed, and those taxa for which age and growth studies have been unverified, verified, or validated, are tabulated. Since the last (1986) review, there have been at least 42 studies initiated addressing age verification in 39 species of elasmobranchs. There are sufficient data to validate the growth zones in only six species."
