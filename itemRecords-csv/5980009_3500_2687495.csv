10,Abstract:,"This book will help fishermen decide whether to direct- market their catch, and tell them how to avoid potential pitfalls of direct marketing. Chapters address strategies for distributing seafood, finding domestic and international customers, packaging and shipping seafood products, the basics of business planning, and other important topics. Based on an earlier edition, the ""Alaska Fisherman's Direct Marketing Manual"", this book has updated information and a much wider geographic focus that includes Washington, Oregon, and California."
