12,Abstract:,"This review of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors from marine organisms presents a compilation of research in this field over the past decade. As an introduction to the research on marine natural products, there is an overview of the role of PLA2 in inflammation that provides a rationale for seeking inhibitors of PLA2 as anti-​inflammatory agents. A radiometric assay to measure inhibition of bee venom PLA2 is described in detail. Examples of marine natural products that inhibit PLA2 are manoalide and its derivatives, scalaradial and related comounds, the pseudopterosins​, the vidalols, and a group of terpenoids that contain masked 1,4-dicarbonyl moieties."
