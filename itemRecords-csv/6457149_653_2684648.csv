12,Abstract:,"The aquatic nuisance species and boating survey was a mail survey of randomly selected boat owners in five states that was conducted by the Minnesota Center for Survey Research at the University of Minnesota. It was coordinated by the University of Minnesota Sea Grant Program and was funded by a grant to the National Sea Grant College Program from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through an appropriation by Congress based on the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, and by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation. The primary goals of this survey were: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of aquatic nuisance species (ANS) boater education programs; (2) to determine the level of understanding about ANS; and (3) to design effective prevention programs for the public that would decrease the spread of ANS by changing boater behavior. Surveys were sent to 4,000 randomly selected registered boat owners in five states: California, Kansas, Minnesota, Ohio, and Vermont. Mailing and data collection were conducted from October 30, 2000 to June 1, 2001."
