11,Abstract:,"Pentachlorophen​ol (PCP) has historically been used as an insecticide, herbicide, algicide, and fungicide, and in recent years it has mainly been used as a wood preservative, (Huckins and Petty 1983). In California, industries using PCP tend to be located in coastal regions, discharging effluents directly into the marine environment. An uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation​, PCP is thought to elicit its effect by destroying the electrochemical potential produced by electron transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane. PCP toxicity may be reduced in aquatic organisms by disposition and biotransformati​on, and different means may be utilized, including reduced absorption, increased depuration, and/or efficient chemical degradation. The purpose here was to measure the rates of both PCP uptake and depuration in the purple sea urchin (""Strongylocent​rotus purpuratus"") following short-term sublethal exposure, and to determine the extent of biotransformati​on and identify the metabolites."
