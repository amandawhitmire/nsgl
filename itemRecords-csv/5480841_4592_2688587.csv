8,Abstract:,"Studies briefly described here were aimed at the development of a cost-effective sturgeon feed formulation. Results suggest that it is possible to produce white sturgeon from hatch to one kg size within one year in a production facility if a good diet, optimum feeding rates, and adequate water temperatures are provided. The persistence of a good growth rate, at least up to two-pound size, suggests a high potential for commercial production white sturgeon. The good growth rate of white sturgeon raised at 18 to 12 deg C also provides an alternative culture species in locations that are too warm for rainbow trout and too cold for channel catfish."
