11,Abstract:,"Lecithotrophic (nonfeeding) larvae of marine invertebrates cannot ingest particulate foods and are assumed to subsist entirely on endogeneous reserves. The aim of this study was to determine whether larvae of the red abalone (""Haliotis rufescens"") could acquire energy from seawater in the form of dissolved organic material (DOM). Results show that ""H. rufescens"" larvae can feed by taking up dissolved free amino acids directly from seawater. At least for this specific fraction of the total DOM pool, the rates of uptake, when compared to the larval metabolic rate, are sufficient to supply a significant amount of energy to these larvae."
