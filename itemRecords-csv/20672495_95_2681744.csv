10,Abstract:,"Estimates of length- and age-at-maturity for California halibut (Paralichthysca​lifornicus) have been reported for southern California, but notcentral California. To provide new estimates of length- and age-​at-​maturityfor central California halibut, we macroscopically examined gonads from635 fish caught between 2012 and 2014 and additionally examined ovarieshistolog​ically. We developed a detailed description of the reproductivepha​ses and spawning states for California halibut, and assigned sex-​specificlength-​ and age-at-maturity to each individual. Males (n=333) ranged from19.1 to 95.9 cm fork length (FL) and 1 to 16 yr of age and females (n=302)ranged from 18.6 to 111.0 cm FL and 1 to 19 yr of age. Males matured atyounger ages and shorter lengths than females. The smallest mature malewas measured at 25.7 cm (1 yr), 50% of males were mature by 27.0 cm(1.1 yr), and 100% were mature by 29.0 cm (3 yr). The smallest maturefemale was measured at 46.6 cm (2 yr), 50% of females were mature by47.3 cm (2.6 yr), and 100% were mature by 51.3 cm (4 yr), according tohistological criteria. Therefore, all California halibut examined were maturebefore reaching the commercial and recreational minimum legal sizelimit of 55.9 cm (22 in). When comparing central California maturity datawith information from southern California, we found that central Californiahalib​ut matured at larger sizes (both sexes) and older ages (femalesonly) than southern California halibut, according to macroscopic criteria."
