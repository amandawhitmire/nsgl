12,Abstract:,"This paper describes the changes that have occurred in the British Columbia halibut fishery since the introduction of an individual vessel quota program in 1991. Among other changes, the timing of landings has changed dramatically, allowing processors to develop new markets and sell essentially all the landed halibut as fresh. The number of processors buying halibut has increased. The number of participating vessels has decreased, and changes have been made in vessel share systems. Many owners favor the changes and individual fishermen report more income and better resource conservation; however, entry into the industry may be more difficult."
