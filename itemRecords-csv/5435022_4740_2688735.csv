11,Abstract:,"In view of the numerous and potent stimulatory effects of thyroid hormone treatments on development of fish embryos and larvae, it is of interest to determine the stages in the life cycles of teleosts when thyroid hormones are present. The experiments summarized in this paper were undertaken to determine the times at which thyroid hormones are present in eggs and larval tissues of striped bass and in the plasma of five species of salmonid larvae."
