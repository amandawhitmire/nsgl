12,Abstract:,"The shellfish mariculture industry in Humboldt Bay has been growing in prominence in terms of seafood production in the region. Despite the industry’s importance, there is little reliable data available about its baseline socioeconomic conditions. To gain more accurate information about the economic dimensions of the Humboldt Bay mariculture industry, we conducted a business survey of all six businesses operating in the Bay. The 23-question survey covered topics including employment, tidelands, facilities and equipment, expenditures, production, revenue, marketing, collaboration, and the industry’s future. Surveys were administered in the summer of 2017 and questions focused on operations in the most recent year: 2016. Results indicate that the mariculture industry is an important contributor to the region’s economy."
