12,Abstract:,"Interdisciplina​ry research integrating biology and materials science is now aimed at identification of the underlying molecular mechanisms of nanofabrication found in highly evolved biological systems and the translation of these mechanisms to synthetic systems. An example of this approach with far-reaching applications in the sciences, engineering, and medicine is the development of a new class of low-temperature catalysts based on mimicry of natural enzymes. The focus of such studies reported here is the unique enzyme recently discovered to be responsible for the nanostructure-​directed synthesis of silica in a marine sponge. Synthesis of silica needles in the sponge, ""Tethya aurantia,"" is mediated by protein filaments that serve as both catalysts and templates. These filaments consist primarily of three highly similar subunits called silicateins (from silica proteins). Molecular cloning and sequence analyses revealed the surprising fact that these proteins are members of a well-known superfamily of proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes. Based on this discovery, the intact filaments and their constituent monomers were subsequently shown in vitro to catalyze the hydrolysis and to structurally direct the polycondensatio​n of silicon alkoxide precursors to form silica and polysilsesquiox-​anes at neutral pH."
