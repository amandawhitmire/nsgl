9,Abstract:,"Research diving in deep oceanic water involves considerations unlike those in any other kind of diving. Sometimes likened to a space walk, blue water diving often takes place in very clear water, without a functional bottom and with no fixed reference points. In this environment, divers are less likely to be aware of depth, buoyancy, current, surge, other divers, large organisms, direction and sense of time. This publication presents recommendations for research divers on diver training, dive equipment, small boat equipment, emergency procedures, and constraints. Appendices include specific procedures used at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and University of California campuses."
