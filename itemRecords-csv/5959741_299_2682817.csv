10,Abstract:,"The purpose of this Implementation Plan is to take a manageable set of issues and topics from the California Sea Grant 2001-2005 Strategic Plan and develop those as two-â€‹year research and outreach priorities for the program. Many objectives of the Strategic Plan, which has been used as the overall framework for the Implementation Plan, are very broad and as such cannot be reasonably achieved in a few years. The Implementation Plan is intended to provide more specific guidance for California Sea Grant in 2004 and 2005."
