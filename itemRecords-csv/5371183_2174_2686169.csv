8,Abstract:,"Drift tubes were released over past and present abalone beds in southern California to investigate the dispersal potential of this species' short-lived larvae. The Channel Islands presently support the important green abalone populations in this region; mainland stocks are largely depleted. While there was some transport between isolated mainland populations within appropriate time periods, results suggest that recolonization by larvae originating elsewhere will be uncommon. In the absence of local broodstock, the present fishery closure is not likely to promote recovery of mainland populations in the near future. These results underscore the importance of local current patterns and details of larval life histories to the understanding of patterns of distribution in any area."
