9,Abstract:,"When commercial fishing activities and offshore oil exploration and development coincide, conflicts may result. This 30-minute VHS video describes geophysical and fishing operations and the conflicts that occur between exploratory seismic survey vessels and commercial fishing fleets which operate off California. The different philosophies of the two industries and the ways that these difficult conflicts have been eased through communications, education, mediation, and research are described. A description of the nine fishing fleets which operate along the south-central coast and the species harvested are also provided. Developed for planners and decision makers in both government and industry, the video is also suitable for both youth and adult audiences interested in our marine resources and offshore industries."
