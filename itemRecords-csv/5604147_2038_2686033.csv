12,Abstract:,"Marine octocorals of the order Gorgonacea, the sea whips and sea fans (Phylum Cnidaria), produce a wide variety of both biologically-​active and structurally-​unique secondary metabolites. Early reports revealed that these organisms produce diterpenoids of the cembrene class, some of which appear to possess defensive properties. Five new cembradiene diterpenoids and two previously known diterpenoids have been isolated from an undescribed Caribbean gorgonian of the genus ""Eunicea""."
