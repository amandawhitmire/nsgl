9,Abstract:,"The change in emphasis from plant products to a combination of fermentation products and synthetic chemicals as the bases of the pharmaceutical industry led to the decline of natural products chemistry as an academic pursuit, especially in the United States and other countries with strong pharmaceutical industries. Against this background, it is remarkable that marine natural products chemistry should have become so well established during the past 20 years. In recent years, technical advances in analytical instrumentation and methodology have greatly enhanced the productivity of the relatively small number of marine natural products chemists. University scientists who study marine natural products have already made some significant contributions toward the discovery of new pharmaceutical agents; research programs have provided a spectacular array of novel compounds, many of which possess useful biological or pharmaceutical properties. The most important of these have been obtained from sessile marine organisms, such as sponges, tunicates, soft corals, gorgonians, and bryozoans."
