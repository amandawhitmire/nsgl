9,Abstract:,"To understand the role of the vas deferens in spermatophore wall formation, structural studies on each region of the vas deferens in the lobster ""Homarus americanus"" were undertaken. The purpose of this article is to provide an anatomical overview of the vas deferens, to describe the ultrastructure of the proximal vas deferens, and to elucidate the role of the proximal vas deferens in spermatophore formation."
