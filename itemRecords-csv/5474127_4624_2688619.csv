9,Abstract:,"Sodium-​potassium-​stimulated adenosinetripho​sphatase (NA+-K+-ATPase, the sodium pump) is generally considered to be the major active mechanism for generating ionic and electrical gradients in tranport epithelia such as the mammalian kidney and the teleost gill. To examine the possible direct effect of cortisol on coho salmon gill Na+-K+-ATPase activity and ouabain binding, an organ culture system was developed for the maintenance of gill tissue for up to 4 days. The method used represents a useful technique for endocrinologica​l, biochemical, and physiological studies of the teleost gill. Results demonstrate that cortisol has direct effects on the osmoregulatory physiology of the teleost gill."
