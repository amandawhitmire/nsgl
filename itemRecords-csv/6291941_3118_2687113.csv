10,Abstract:,"A growing number of marine finfishes are currently under investigation as candidates for artificial propagation - for stocking, endangered species restoration, and human consumption. This project addresses a leading concern about placing hatchery-born fish into an environment where they either directly or indirectly co-mingle with wild species - the potential to introduce or spread disease."
