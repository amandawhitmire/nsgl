14,Abstract:,"Commercially important oysters are often subjected to mass mortality inthe field. Rationalizing that heat shock can induce tolerance to stresses other that heat, the authors studied whether this treatment might improve subsequent survival in the field. Heat shock of 37 deg. C for 1h enabled Pacific oysters (""Crassostrea gigas"") to survive an otherwise lethal heat treatment (43-44 deg. C., 1h). This induced thermotolerance was retained for at least 2 weeks, the longest period examined. Stress proteins of the 70-kDa family were studied in gills by conventional autoradiography and immunoblotting techniques."
