18,Abstract:,"Bacteria use small diffusible molecules to exchange information in a process called quorum sensing (QS). An important class of quorum sensing molecules used by Gram-negative bacteria is the family of Nacylhomoserine lactones (HSL). It was recently discovered that a degradation product of the QS molecule 3-​oxo-​C12-​homoserine lactone, the tetramic acid 3-​(1-​hydroxydecylide​ne)-​5-​(2-​hydroxyethyl)py​rrolidine-​2,4-​ dione, is a potent antibacterial agent, thus implying roles for QS outside of simply communication. Because these tetramic acids also appear to bind iron with appreciable affinity it was suggested that metal binding might contribute to their biological activity. Here, using a variety of spectroscopic tools, we describe the coordination chemistry of both the methylidene and decylidene tetramic acid derivatives with Fe(III) and Ga(III) and discuss the potential biological significance of such metal binding."
