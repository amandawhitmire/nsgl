10,Abstract:,"The Pacific Sea Grant Advisory Program is an experiment in cooperation-​cooperation between the Pacific marine community and the universities and federal agencies serving that community. Concerned university and agency personnel began meeting in 1969 to explore ways that their institutions could share capabilities in cooperative and innovative ventures to identify and respond to the needs of the Pacific marine community. Out of these meetings came the Pacific Sea Grant Advisory Program's first project: a series of workshops along the northern Pacific coast to teach good sanitation practices to personnel aboard commercial fishing boats and in seafood processing plants. These workshops were conducted in 1970. This project was so successful that Sea Grant's first regional marine advisory effort, The Pacific Sea Grant Marine Advisory Program (PASGAP), was formally organized and funded in March 1971 by the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the National Sea Grant Program."
