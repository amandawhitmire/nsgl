11,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study was to attempt to provide an answer to each of the following two questions: 1. what are the ocean-related needs of the State of California as expressed by government, people, and industry? 2. What can the Sea Grant Program in California do to assist in the fulfillment of the expressed needs? The sample of persons chosen for interviews was not a ""random"" sample from the population of California, but was stratified. We were asked to obtain the views of ""... state officials, industrial leaders, local officials, federal agencies, and people who are already carrying on research on ocean-related problems."" The persons interviewed were all ones who had some reason, by virtue of their positions, to have some concerns about the ocean. Because time was short the sample was necessarily small. Personal interviews were held with eighty-four persons during July, August, and September, 1971. We were not asked to cover fisheries in our study because a separate study was conducted of the living marine resources. However, in the process of interviewing, some fisheries information was obtained and has been included and identified as such. Finally, this study was the first effort of a planned, ongoing program to monitor the expressed ocean-related needs and problems of California and to determine who is working to solve the problems. This report is a condensation of an earlier preliminary report presented to the UC Sea Grant Coordinating Council in November."
