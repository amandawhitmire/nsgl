11,Abstract:,"This report presents the results of research activities undertaken by the California Sea Grant College System. As part of a series of biennial completion reports, it would normally have covered research completed in fiscal years 1994 to 1996. However, because of a change in our proposal cycle, we have included projects which were completed in 1997 as well. The report is meant to be a technical record of our accomplishments for use by individuals in academia, government, and industry. It thus forms a valuable historical record of program achievement and an important document in terms of program accountability.â€‹ For readers unfamiliar with our program, the California Sea Grant College System is the largest of 29 Sea Grant programs underway in more than half the nation's states. Its purpose is clearly stated in the 1966 National Sea Grant College and Program Act responsible for its creation: ""to increase the under standing, assessment, development, utilization, and conservation of the nation's ocean and coastal resources by providing assistance to promote a strong educational base, responsive research and training activities, and broad and prompt dissemination of knowledge and techniques."" The California Sea Grant College System is administered by the University of California and is head quartered at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, part of the University of California, San Diego."
