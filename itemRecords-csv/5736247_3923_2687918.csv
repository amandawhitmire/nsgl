17,Abstract:,"Extracts and pure compounds isolated from four samples of ""Dysidea"" sp. sponges collected from the Indo-Pacific were assayed against five different enzyme assays, four of which are relevant to anticancer drug discovery and one of which may detect compunds significant in modulating the development of atherosclerotic plaque. The pure compounds that inhibited various enzymes were polybrominated phenols and polybrominated phenoxyphenols."
