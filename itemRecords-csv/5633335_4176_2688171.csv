11,Abstract:,"The South African soft coral ""Alcyonium valdivae"" contains five diterpene esters, valdivones A and B, the corresponding methoxy ketals, and dihydrovaldivon​e A. Although the producing organisms are unrelated taxonomically, the valdivones are most closely related to the sarcodictins from the stoloniferan coral ""Sarcodictyon roseum"". Valdivones A and B inhibit chemically- induced inflammation in the mouse ear assay."
