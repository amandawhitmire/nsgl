12,Abstract:,"The purpose of this study was to determine the spread of smooth cordgrass (""Spartina alterniflora"") and ""Spartina foliosa"" x ""alterniflora"" hybrids within the San Francisco Bay and along the California coast, and to examine the degree of hybridization occurring in the marshes using species-â€‹specific nuclear DNA markers. The authors consider: (1) where do hybrid populations occur?; (2) how extensive is the hybridization in areas of overlap?; and (3) what are the frequencies of the various hybrid classes, and does this suggest that introgressive hybridization is taking place? They also consider the ecosystem impacts of the proliferation of the hybrid and ""S. alterniflora"", and suggest strategies for their control in California."
