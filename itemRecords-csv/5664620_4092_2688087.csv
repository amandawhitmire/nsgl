10,Abstract:,"The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which broad changes in light and nutrient availablility modify the nitrate uptake capacity of mature blades of the giant kelp, ""Macrocystis pyrifera"". In addition, the suitability of blade disks as experimental units to examine nitrate uptake rate was determined. Results demonstrated that mature blade tissue responds to increased N availability by decreasing its capacity to take up nitrate and by increasing its investment in photosynthetic pigments. This study provides evidence for a dynamic regulatory system that responds to changes in nitrate availability in an integrated manner."
