10,Abstract:,"Biomolecular Sciences and Engineering, University of California Santa Barbara, Goleta, California. Marine gastropods of the genus Busycon (the whelks) lay eggs in the shallow waters of the intertidal zone. These eggs must endure harsh forces from wave impacts, abrasion from sand and debris, and attacks from predators. As such, the organism has evolved to produce a robust casing to protect the eggs. Whelk egg capsule biopolymer (WECB) is an acellular, highly elastic, proteinaceous material that is secreted by the animal to surround developing embryos while in this harsh environment. Stress-strain studies of WECB indicate two regions with distinctly different Young's moduli. At low strain there is high modulus in the range of 150 MPa. However, after being pulled past 3% strain, there is a sudden two orders of magnitude drop in stiffness, down to the 3 MPa range, which is maintained until just before the breaking strain of ~170%. When the material is cyclically strained to a point below its maximum extension, it undergoes an energy absorbing hysteresis and upon subsequent strain, fully recovers the initial high modulus that was present in the first pulling of the material, enabling the material to maintain levels of strain energy and hysteresis for numerous cycles. The recovery is near instantaneous and fully repeatable for a seemingly infinite number of cycles on the same sample. Amino acid analysis of acid hydrolysates from the material indicates a similar composition to α-​keratins, another protein based material which exhibits recoverable yield mechanics. One notable difference being that WECB has no disulfide bonds, where as keratins are employ disulfide bonds heavily. There is evidence for lysine based crosslinks in WECB, similar to those found in elastin, and ESI MS/MS studies are being planned to confirm this. Wide-angle x-ray scattering and Raman spectroscopy studies have elucidated a reversible α-helix to β-sheet transition when WECB is strained past the yield point, again similar to that of α-keratin materials. This secondary structure transition is reversed when the material is allowed to relax back to a nonstrained state. It is hypothesized that this transition is responsible for the differences in moduli between the pre and post yield regions, as it is in α- keratins. In addition to the crosslinking mechanism and increased extensibility, there are other significant differences between WECB and α- keratin. Most notable is the fact that while α-keratins are mono-axial filaments which only display these kinds of mechanical properties in one dimension along the orientation of the fiber, WECB is a poly-laminate two-dimensional sheet which can be strained in any direction across the plane and still show these properties. Preliminary EM studies show that WECB is highly ordered, but in a way different than the micro and macro fibrils of the keratins. Further EM and small-angle x-ray scattering studies are being planned to resolve the ultramolecular structure of the material."
