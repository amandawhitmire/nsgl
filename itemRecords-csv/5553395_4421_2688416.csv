11,Abstract:,"The application of reliability methods in development of design criteria for the Freeport McMoRan Resource Partners Main Pass Block 299 Sulfur Mine Platforms is described and illustrated. Reliability engineering principles are outlined, including assessment of structural reliability and characterizatioâ€‹n of acceptable reliability. This development is cast in the context of the traditional methods that were used for the design of the structure and foundation elements that comprised these structures. Special attention is given to design criteria for the foundation piles as influenced by the substantial subsidence projected for several of the platforms."
