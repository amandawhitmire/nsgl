11,Abstract:,"Two experiments were used to assess the effects of barotrauma on initial capture survival and short-term postrecompressi​on survival of line- caught (range 18?225 m) southern California rockfish (Sebastes spp.). Occurrence of external and internal signs of barotrauma was characterized across all species. Despite species-​specific differences in the extent of barotrauma observed, initial capture survival of rockfish held in a live well for a 10-min period following capture was 68% overall (19 species, n = 168). Overall 2-day survival of rockfish following recompression in cages was also 68% (17 species, n = 257). Short-term survival varied across species (range 36% to 82%), as did the occurrence of external signs of barotrauma. The degree of external signs of barotrauma was not a significant predictor of initial capture survival or short-term survival. The most significant predictor of short-term survival was surface holding time, with short-term survival increasing with decreasing surface holding time. These results suggest that rapid recompression of rockfish can significantly decrease discard mortality and could potentially enhance rockfish conservation."
