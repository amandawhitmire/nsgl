10,Abstract:,"The generally accepted mechanism for galvanically induced degradation of matrix materials in carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) is nucleophilic attack of hydrolyzable polymer linkages by hydroxyl ions (OH)- evolved at the cathode. An alternate damage mechanism is presented here for damage observed previously in a nonhydrolyzable polymer. It is suggested that damaging concentrations of highly reactive perhydroxyl ions (HO2) form within occluded regions of high pH such as beneath calcareous films or around debonded fibers, in a synergistic mechanism analogous to crevice corrosion at metal anodes. Perhydroxyl ion is unlikely to contribute to polymer degradation at bare cathode surfaces, but damaging concentrations are predicted to occur within occluded regions of high pH."
