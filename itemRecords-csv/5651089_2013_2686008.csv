15,Abstract:,"The striped bass, ""Morone saxatilis"", was first introduced into the San Francisco Bay--Delta system in the late 1800s, and a thriving commercial fishery had been established by the turn of the century. However, the population has been in decline since the early 1960s, coinciding with industrializatiâ€‹on of the region, intensive agricultural practices, and increased freshwater exports from the system. The summer die-off in the lower delta has been an annual occurrence for more than 40 yrs. In 1985, efforts were begun to collect moribund fish near the Carquinez Strait and to compare their physiological state with that of 'healthy' fish from adjacent waters. Early results suggested liver disease as an important component of the pathology of striped bass during the summer mortality. This study extends previous observations on moribund and healthy striped bass caught near the Carquinez Strait area and compares them with adult fish caught off the coast of the San Francisco peninsula."
