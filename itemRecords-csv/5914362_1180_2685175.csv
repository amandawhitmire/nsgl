14,Abstract:,"With ecological criteria as a theoretical framework, the authors developed a series of steps for designing a network of marine reserves, using California's Channel Islands as a case study. In general, the percentage of an area to be included in a reserve network depends on the goals. In the Channel Islands, after consideration of both goals and risks, scientists recommended reserving an area of 30-50% of all representative habitats in each biogeographic region. A simulated annealing algorithm was used to identify potential reserve network scenarios that would represent all habitats within the smallest area possible."
