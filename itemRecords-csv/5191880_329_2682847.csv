9,Abstract:,"How will the oceans be managed, developed, and preserved in the future? And where will the needed expertise come from— the future geologists, climatologists, recreation specialists, marine biologists, harbor designers and managers, maritime lawyers? One place they will come from is USC—one of the few institutions in the United States and the only one in this region which can provide the broad training necessary to meet the future manpower needs in substantially all of the marine-​related fields. A vital part of this developing program in marine sciences is the USC Sea Grant Program. Since 1969 this program has concentrated on marine research and educational opportunities that have cut across traditional disciplinary lines. In this way, the full range of USC's academic experience can be brought to bear on important problems and opportunities associated with the southern California coastal zone. This report summarizes the eighth year of participation in this program. Some 16 projects were undertaken, 11 of which were research projects. They are divided into six substantive areas—Resource Development, Socio-​Economics, Environmental Quality, Coastal Engineering, Marine Advisory Services, and Marine Education and Training. The following annual report for 1977-1978 summarize the results of these projects."
