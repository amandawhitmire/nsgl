9,Abstract:,"Coastal resources are under increasing pressure from population growth; almost half the U.S. population now lives in coastal counties. New methods are needed for managing coastal resources and water quality in the face of population growth and the often conflicting needs of agriculture, recreation, conservation, fishing, manufacturing and mining. Nonpoint source pollution (NPS) is a significant factor in degradation of coastal water quality. Nationally, agriculture has been identified as the nation's leading contributor of NPS pollution. Yet, agriculture is a vital economic sector. Environmental interests and government agencies perceive agriculture as slow to control pollution, whereas agricultural producers fear broad brush regulatory programs will unnecessarily burden those less likely to produce runoff. New coastal NPS pollution management programs must be economically achievable, enforceable and provide opportunities for public participation in all aspects of the program. If industry is a partner in the planning process, an adversarial relationship and resultant problems can be avoided. Environmental representatives must also participate as full partners, if the community is to accept decisions."
