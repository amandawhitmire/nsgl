9,Abstract:,"White sturgeon (""Acipenser transmontanus"") has become one of the fastest growing North American aquaculture species for both fisheries enhancement and commercial production. There is, however, a lack of information on their nutrient requirements and optimum feeding rates, especially under culture conditions. The objective of the present study was to determine the optimum feeding rate for maximum growth and feed conversion (minimum feed gain ratio) for juvenile white sturgeon (30-100 g) when held at 20 deg C. and fed a purified diet for 8 weeks."
