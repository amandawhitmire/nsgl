9,Abstract:,"A multifactorial experimental design was used to determine the relative contributions in-vitro of each of three common symbionts (""Carcinonemertâ€‹es epialti, Lagenidium callinectes"", and ""Leucothrix"" sp.) to the egg mortality of the crab, ""Cancer anthonyi"" (""C. anthonyi"" was used as it is abundant in California and breeds year-round). The susceptibility of eggs in different developmental stages was also examined. In addition, the effect of temperature on egg mortality and development, and on symbiont behavior, was investigated."
