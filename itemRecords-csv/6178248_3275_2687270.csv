12,Abstract:,"Two research programs, Partnership for Interdisciplinaâ€‹ry Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) and Channel Islands National Park - Kelp Forest Monitoring (NPS-KFM) program use SCUBA surveys to monitor kelp forest communities inside and outside of marine reserves around the northern Channel Islands. On average, species targeted by fishing are larger and more abundant, resulting in greater biomass (total weight), in marine reserves than in fished waters. In contrast, abundance, biomass and size of species that are not targeted by fishing generally are similar in reserves and fished waters. These results suggest that removal of fishing pressure within reserves may account for the difference in abundance, size and biomass."
