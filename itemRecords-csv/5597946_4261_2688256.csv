10,Abstract:,"The biological and biochemical pharmacology of fuscoside, a novel anti-​inflammatory marine natural product isolated from the Caribbean gorgonian ""Eunicea fusca"", has been characterized using murine models of inflammation. These studies represent the first report of an anti-​inflammatory marine natural product that selectively inhibits leukotriene biosynthesis."
