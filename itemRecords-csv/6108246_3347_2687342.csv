10,Abstract:,"The California Marine Life Management Act and Marine Life Protection Act have created an increased interest in the development of fine-scaled fishery management plans. Currently, however, little information exists with which to manage fisheries in relatively small sections of the coast. One way to gather data appropriate for fine-scale management is to use a variety of information sources and sampling methods. We have been working with fishermen, and university and agency scientists since 2003 to compare various surface fishing and SCUBA sampling methods, and learn more about population sizes and movements of nearshore fishes."
