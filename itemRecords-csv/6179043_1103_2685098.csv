13,Abstract:,"Embryos of beach-spawning California grunion Leuresthes tenuis (Atherinopsidaeâ€‹) incubate in damp sand above the tide line until triggered to hatch when waves wash them free. If not swept out by a syzygy tide series, the embryos extend incubation for as long as yolk energy resources persist, up to three times longer than the primary time required to reach hatching competence. At whatever time hatching is triggered, larval life begins. While the embryos are encapsulated within the clear chorion, they are alert and respond to stimuli. They maintain a high metabolic rate and can hatch within seconds once the environmental trigger presents. Thus the extended incubation period does not involve cryptobiosis arrested metabolism. We developed a staging series for the normal incubation period to hatching competence, approximately 10 days at 20oC. Then we hatched out embryos after different intervals in an extended incubation period, for up to 25 additional days. We photographed and measured the hatchlings initially and for four weeks of larval growth. At hatching, all hatchlings look similar. Those that hatched later were slightly larger and had more heavily pigmented melanophores but otherwise resembled primary hatchlings. Growth rates for the larvae fed ad libitum were similar no matter how late they began larval life, and all were approximately the same size within 21 days post hatch, no matter how many days they incubated. Unlike some terrestrially incubating amphibian embryos that advance in developmental stage while delaying hatching, grunion embryos appear to maintain steady metabolism but dramatically slow the progress of aging while waiting for the right trigger to enter into their next stage of life in the aquatic habitat.
