14,Abstract:,"In this paper the authors critically examine the evidence regarding whether or not intensive fisheries on male Dungeness crabs impair mating success and (or) limit production of eggs among female Dungeness crabs. They may present new and (or) previously unpublished data from northern California and British Columbia concerning (1) sizes of male and female crabs collected in premating embraces, (2) CW frequencies of female Dungeness crabs collected in traps nonselective with respect to female size, (3) relationships among fecundity, CW, and molting history, and (4) presence of sperm plugs and sperm among females of varied sizes and molting histories. They also review relevant published studies concerning reproduction and growth of female Dungeness crabs."
