13,Abstract:,"This study was aimed at increasing understanding of the endocrine changes that occur during sexual maturation and ovulation in female brown trout. The hormone profiles were followed during vitellogenesis and final maturation in wild trout, while a short-term study of the changes that occur during final maturation was made in cultured females. The sampling protocols were designed to get a high resolution of the various hormone profiles, as rapid changes in plasma hormone levels may take place. Discrepancies observed between wild and cultured females may be due to differences in stress susceptibility, environmental conditions, life cycles, or to genetic divergence between the strains."
