9,Abstract:,In order to understand the process of underwater optical image formation it is important to consider the environmental parameters that dictate the propagation of light in the water. Both attenuation and scattering play a fundamental role with varying ratios as a function of the different types of suspended matter. This article addresses the topic of the current state of the art of underwater vision sensors. Both visual and sonar sensor technology are surveyed and the performance of an assortment of currently available commercial technology is surveyed. Also described is a 3-dimensional sonar imaging system (Fish TV) that is currently under development.
