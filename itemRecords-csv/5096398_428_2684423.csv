13,Abstract:,"The large Lockheed submersible Deep Quest was instrumented with three geotechnical probes operated by two independent motor-driven penetration systems. The probes consist of (1) a vane for the discontinuous, direct measurement of shear strength to a sediment depth of 3.4 m, (2) a nuclear transmission densitometer for the continuous, direct measurement of bulk density and indirect measurement of water content to a sediment depth of 1.2 m, and (3) attached to the densitometer, a cone penetrometer for the continuous, indirect measurement of shear strength to a sediment depth of 0.9 m. The vane and densitometer-​penetrometer probes were individually controlled from inside the submersible's pressure hull by an eight-channel, two-wire telemetry system. The probes were successfully operated in 1971 to a water depth of 1.23 km in the San Diego Trough Geotechnical Test Area, located about 30 km west of San Diego, California. The small Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution submersible Alvin was instrumented with the combination densitometer-​penetrometer probe, attached to the bow of the submersible by a rack and pinion drive assembly. The probe was driven 1.5 m into the bottom by actuating the drive assembly with the Alvin's manipulator arm. Operations at a water depth of about 0.24 km were successfully conducted in 1971 in the Wilkinson Basin Geotechnical Test Area, about 120 km east of Boston, Massachusetts."
