10,Abstract:,"The patterns of thyroid ontogeny in fish are variable and correlations of larval thyroid function with specific developmental events are inconsistent. The possibility that maternal thyroid hormones stored in yolk may influence early development requires attention. The availability of hormones from this potential alternate source may aid in the interpretation of the early sensitivity to exogenous thyroid hormones and the absence of a close relationship of the onset of larval thryoid function with events in differentiation​, although it raises a variety of other questions. Some of these are addressed in this paper. In order to evaluate the evolutionary significance of the proposed maternal contribution to the regulation of embryogenesis and larval differentiation​, the case for thyroid involvement in early differentiation in other vertebrate classes is also considered."
