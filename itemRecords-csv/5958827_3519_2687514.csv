12,Abstract:,"Tunichrome ""Sp-1"" is a modified pentapeptide from the ascidian ""Styela plicata"", having the structure H-DOPA- DOPA-​Gly-​Pro-​dc-​delta-​DOPA. The tandem mass spectrum of the peptide is dominated by a number of abundant fragment ions that involve a gas-phase rearrangement where the dc-delta- DOPA group becomes covalently attached to the N-terminus. The high degree of rearrangement in ""Sp-1"" compared with a related octapeptide, plicatamide, allowed for detailed multiple mass spectrometric experiments, and hence permitted a detailed assessment of the origin and routes to the formation of the various rearrangement ions. Analyses on both a triple-​quadrupole and a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer were made to ascertain whether the gas- phase rearrangements observed for tunichrome ""Sp-1"" were unique to an ion trap mass spectrometer (i.e. the hypothesis being that perhaps the extended trapping times were required to facilitate this unusual gas-phase rearrangement). Interestingly, analyses suggest that the smaller size of tunichrome ""Sp-1"" compared with plicatamide facilitates the transfer of the dc-delta-DOPA group, and also that the presence of dc-delta-DOPA is critical for this gas-phase rearrangement."
