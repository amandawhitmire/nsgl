11,Abstract:,"Coastal marine and estuarine habitats are as diverse as they are critical to the health of aquatic environments. From salt marshes to seagrasses, from coral reefs to mangrove ecosystems, kelp forests and river systems, they serve a variety of functions. Their degradation and loss are reflected in such obvious ways as declining fisheries and poor water quality. The creation, enhancement and restoration of these habitats are not simple matters--they require more than just cultivating vegetation or transplanting corals or nourishing beaches. This book covers a number of restoration activities, for example, restoration of riverine habitats impacted by logging, fish habitat restoration as a result of hydroelectric dam construction, and restoration of wetland habitats in urbanized estuaries. Each chapter details the experience of experts who explain their objectives, their methods, their successes and failures, and their perceived needs for the future. As a guide to planners and policymakers, as a handbook for researchers and students, this is a significant contribution to a relatively young science that, in many cases, remains experimental."
