7,Abstract:,"Over the next century, sea level rise in Southern California is expected to match global projectionswith an increase of 0.1-0.6 meters (5-24 inches) from 2000 to 2050 and 0.4-1.7 meters (17-66 inches)from 2000 to 2100. Rising seas, combined with the threat of other coastal impacts such as coastalerosion, high tides and severe storms, are driving coastal communities to begin planning for thesechallenges and identifying strategies to adapt. Results from USGS's Coastal Storm Modeling System(CoSMoS) support numerous local municipalities who may use the findings to plan for climate changeimpacts, including adaptation planning, updating Local Coastal Plans per guidance from the State ofCalifornia, and conducting risk assessments for local hazard mitigation plans. This fact sheet provides an overview of the benefits of CoSMoS and technical assistance available from USC Sea Grant."
