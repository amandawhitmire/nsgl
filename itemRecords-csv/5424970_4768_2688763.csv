11,Abstract:,"In the spring of their second year, coho salmon (""Oncorhynchus kisutch"") parr undergo smoltification, a complex series of morphological, behavioral, physiological, and biochemical changes which transform the stream-dwelling animal into a seaward-​migratory smolt. In this study, gills were examined in coho salmon for structural correlates with physiological and biochemical changes associated with increased seawater (SW) tolerance during smoltification. Chloride cells were studied in the gill filament and in the opercular membrane. Gill Na+, K+ -ATPase activity and SW tolerance were used as indicators of the development of SW-​osmoregulatory mechanisms during smoltification. Plasma thyroxine and prolactin levels were also measured."
