10,Abstract:,"Homeotic transformation is defined as transformation of one body part into the likeness of something else. By autotransplanta​tion of crab claw tissue into the autotomized stump of the fourth walking leg, the stump can regenerate a complete claw. Contralateral autotransplanta​tion can induce the regeneration of a claw with normal handedness. Most of the transformed claws combined features of the claw and the walking leg, suggesting that both host and donor tissues play a role in regeneration. Simple intercalary regeneration does not explain all of the observations, but some regulatory events might be taking place during regeneration. Two other processes-​-​secretion of some morphogen by the claw tissue, and alteration in the expression of ""Hox"" genes--offer alternatives that might explain the results of this study."
