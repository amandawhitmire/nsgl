10,Abstract:,"Successful breeding of captive white sturgeon is dependent on the administration of exogenous gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) to induce spermiation in males and ovulation in females. In this study, mature male sturgeon were studied to determine if stress associated with GnRHa treatment can reduce the effectiveness of GnRHa in inducing GtH release. In conjunction with GnRHa administration, the fish were exposed to one of two stressors: low stress consisting of briefly removing fish from the tanks, and high stress treatment consisting of a sequence of removal from the tank followed by repeated brief air emersions, crowding and handling. It is concluded that the short term management practices routinely used during the administration of GnRHa do not interfere with the action of GnRHa in male sturgeon."
