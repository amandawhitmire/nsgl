9,Abstract:,The study of the regulation of molting is largely a study of ecdysteroids and this chapter is a reflection of that reality. The regulation of molting is reviewed by examining the data pertaining to the regulation of ecdysteroid titers and the mode of action of ecdysteroids. The former topic includes not only a discussion of internal sources of ecdysteroids and the rates of synthesis and secretion but also the neurosecretory and systemic elements involved in signalling or regulating `molting glands'. The latter topic of necessity includes a comparison with the current model of steroid hormones derived largely from vertebrate systems.
