11,Abstract:,"This survey was conducted by the University of Southern California Research Institute for Business and Economics, the research arm of the Graduate School of Business Administration, in support of the US National Sea Grant Program. Sea Grant utilizes a multidisciplina​ry approach to enhancing national resources in marine related activities through involvement of institutions of higher learning in areas of education, research, and advisory services. In order to determine if any recognizable trends could be established regarding utilization of the ocean or land along the California coast during the next ten years, questionnaires were mailed to 1,674 organizations. 312 were returned, and of these, 146 indicated they had growth or development plans involving the use of the coastal resources. The primary objective of this survey is to discover and delineate possible trends regarding the projected utilization of California's coastal (land and sea) resources during the coming decade."
