11,Abstract:,"A morphologically distinct Fijian sponge, ""Plakortis"" sp., has yielded two new peroxides, plakortolide E and plakoric acid. After standing for approximately one year, plakortolide E rearranged to plakortolide ether. The structures of plakortolide E and plakortolide ether were established from 2D nmr data and by analogy to a known compound, plakortolide. This represents the first absolute stereochemistry determination for a sponge-derived polyketide peroxide. The characterizatioâ€‹n of plakoric acid was based on spectral analogies to known polyketides such as plakortin. Plakortolide E exhibited selective potency against the melanoma and breast tumor cell lines in the in vitro 60-cell line panel of the National Cancer Institute."
