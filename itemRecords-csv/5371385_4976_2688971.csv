8,Abstract:,"Chronic mortalities have been a recurrent problem in common goldfish ""Carassius auratus"" throughout the United States and a coccidian, morphologically identical to ""Goussia carpelli"", is suspected to be the primary etiological agent. Goldfish became infected shortly after hatching and sporulated oocysts were found in 15-day-old fish. After six weeks they stopped feeding, became lethargic, emaciated, and cumulative mortalities of 50-75% occurred over a 2-3 week period. Histological analyses of these fish revealed numerous yellow bodies, inflammatory and necrotic cells in the lamina propria of the gut, and the intestines often had lost their villar structure. Experimental infection in the laboratory was accomplished using tubificid worms and grass shrimp fed oocysts, but direct transmission of the parasite using fresh or cold aged oocysts was unsuccessful."
