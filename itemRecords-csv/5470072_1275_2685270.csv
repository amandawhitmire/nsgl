8,Abstract:,"Techniques of cohort analysis or virtual population analysis are widely used to estimate historical population abundances and exploitation patterns in fisheries. Most of the limitations of the individual cohort techniques can be dealt with collectively by using multiple cohort techniques, here called separable virtual population analysis because the fishing mortality rates are separated into annual fishing effort and vulnerability at age. Instead of using a single vector of catch-at-age data for one cohort, multiple cohort techniques use a matrix of catch-at-age data for fish of all ages in all years. This paper adapts separable virtual population analysis techniques to the complex life history of Pacific salmonids, and presents a method for dealing with uncertainty in the error structure of data. The techniques developed are applied to marked chinook salmon, ""Oncorhynchus tshawytscha"", from hatcheries in California's Central Valley, and some management implications of the results are discussed."
