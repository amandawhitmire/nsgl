9,Abstract:,"Humboldt State University, one of the nineteen campuses of the California State College and University System, has for over 25 years been known for its strong educational efforts in natural resource conservation and management. Programs in fisheries science, marine biology, and oceanography have provided a pool of talent (both faculty and student) for Sea Grant research, and although the number of active projects at any one time has never been great, there has been a steady research output since the first grant was awarded in 1969. In September, 1976, the Humboldt State Coherent Area Program formally affiliated with the University of California Sea Grant College Program; the institution now carries out Sea Grant research as an integral part of that program. This is a report of the Humboldt State University Sea Grant Program in Arcata, California for 1974-1975 and 1975-1976."
