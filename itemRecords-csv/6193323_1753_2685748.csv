12,Abstract:,"Riparian forest stands dominated by cottonwood and willow species are typical of alluvial streams in semi-arid climates such as the middle Sacramento River (Red Bluff to Colusa). In these habitats, physical processes determine the forest's regeneration rate and age structure. Hydrologic patterns provide the necessary conditions for recruitment, and channel migration drives patterns of forest stand dynamics. Here we develop a conceptual model that incorporates the physical processes governing riparian forest development with the landscape patterns that dominate geomorphically active rivers, using the middle Sacramento River as a case study. It has long been understood that recruitment events for cottonwood and willow species depend on floods coincident with the annual seed release period. To date, studies of pioneer riparian forest structure have focused primarily on point bar habitats, where woody vegetation typically recruits along a linear band parallel to the river margin. Over time, the repetition of these events in combination with point bar migration creates a landscape pattern with a series of parallel, even-aged stands. However, there are indications that other recruitment pathways exist and can be important from a population and conservation perspective. On floodplains where channel migration occurs as punctuated cutoff or avulsion events, the geometry and position of the old channel relative to the new one determines rates and patterns of sedimentation and flood frequency. Geomorphic evolution of the former channel habitat in turn influences forest dynamics. For example, recruitment into an oxbow-type former channel appears to commonly occur shortly after the cutoff event, presumably because these 'safe sites' are protected from scour, but rapid vegetation development prevents subsequent recruitment. As a result, mature forest patches in these former channel types are characterized by single, even-aged stands. Understanding the contribution of alternative recruitment pathways to forest equilibrium dynamics is essential for designing conservation strategies for streams like the middle Sacramento River."
