9,Abstract:,"During the decade of the 1990s, several major fishing countries will launch satellites with improved, next-generation ocean color sensors. This new technology, especially when combined with satellite-based estimates of sea surface temperature and geographic information systems, provides the possibility of near real-time support for the management and utilization of both pelagic and mid- to deep-water fisheries. This report reviews current state-​of-​the-​art efforts in these areas, makes projections about anticipated uses of the new technologies in global marine fisheries, and evaluates the position of the United States relative to foreign fishing powers in the aforementioned areas."
