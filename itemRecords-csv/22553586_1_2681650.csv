11,Abstract:,"Sea Grant was created by the U.S. Congress in 1966 as a federal and state partnership to help fund and coordinate the intellectual capacity of the nation’s universities to solve ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes problems. Sea Grant is a national network, which includes the National Sea Grant Office, the National Sea Grant Advisory Board, the National Sea Grant Law Center, the National Sea Grant Library and 33 university-​based state programs. Sea Grant is administered and supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is implemented through leading research universities, and provides unique access to scientific expertise and to new discoveries. The Sea Grant Program at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, California, is unique among the 33 state programs in the national Sea Grant network. It is among the smallest, with an annual federal budget of approximately $1 million. USC, one of the largest private universities in the United States, has participated in the National Sea Grant College Program for over 40 years, and has more than a one hundred year history of marine science research in Southern California. USC’s facilities, research, and curricula make it the principal university in the Los Angeles region for ocean studies. Using a network of scientists, government agency personnel, and private and public sector advisors, USC Sea Grant is able to anticipate research needs in a relatively short time frame. USC’s strategic plan goals for 2014-2017 reflect America’s most urgent coastal and ocean needs, the NOAA’s priorities, and the National Sea Grant’s goals, while still addressing the specific needs and priorities of the state and region. USC’s location in the middle of Los Angeles has made the Sea Grant Program at USC an important regional resource, concentrating on issues arising out of the necessity of managing people and natural resources in an intensely urban and developed coastline. For this reason, in the 1980s, the USC Sea Grant program adopted as its programmatic theme the “Urban Ocean,” a theme that continues to characterize our focus on the needs of this region. Under the larger umbrella of the urban ocean programmatic theme, our program’s focus areas are congruent with the National Sea Grant College Program Strategic Plan for 2014-2017 (henceforth referred to as the National Plan) and include: Healthy Coastal Ecosystems; Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture; Resilient Communities and Economies; and Environmental Literacy and Workforce Development. We continue to foster innovative research to help find solutions for pressing coastal management problems and to demand that science truly help resolve the issues of greatest ecological and social importance. USC Sea Grant fosters the public’s understanding of the science, so that it motivates better decisions and continues to bring decision makers, scientists and the public together to find solutions that are informed by the best available science, understood by all, and supported by local communities."
