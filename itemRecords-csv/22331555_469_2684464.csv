15,Abstract:,"The third coastal adaptation needs assessment, administered in 2016, provides a snapshot of the current state of coastal adaptation in California, and constitutes a longitudinal assessment of the changing needs of coastal professionals since 2006. The only comprehensive, longitudinal assessment of adaptation in the country, the study aimed to (1) understand the state and context of coastal adaptation and understand how to move it forward; (2) identify information, training, technical assistance, financial and other support needs; and in so doing, (3) assess what difference past technical and financial assistance have made in advancing coastal adaptation. An extensive survey instrument was administered in the summer and fall of 2016. The target populations were local, regional, state, federal, private sector, and NGO professionals involved in coastal management and adaptation (total survey population was more than 2,700). The response rate and survey population are very similar to the previous survey population engaged in 2011, enabling a statewide comparison. Results are summarized in four parts: (1) current coastal management challenges; (2) attitudes toward climate change and adaptation motivations, actions, barriers, expenditures and needs; (3) information, technical support and training needs to further advance adaptation; and (4) demographics of the survey participants. Moreover, in most instances they analyzed by different respondent groups and by region. The overarching finding is that sea-level rise has become the leading present-day coastal management concern and coastal adaptation is further advanced now compared to 2011 across California, but coastal professionals continue to face significant hurdles in moving from understanding coastal risks to planning and implementing actions."
