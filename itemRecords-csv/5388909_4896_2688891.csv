17,Abstract:,"It is well established that prolactin (PRL) is an important hormone for freshwater adaptation of certain euryhaline teleosts. The osmoregulatory role of PRL in salmonids may be partially evaluated by measuring the blood concentration of the hormone and its metabolic clearance rate. Several attempts have been made to use radioimmunoassa​y (RIA) procedures for ovine PRL for measurement of circulating PRL in several salmonid species; however, without rigorous validation of the RIA, the substance(s) measured in the heterologous RIA remains unidentified. Recently, highly purified preparations of PRLs have been obtained from the pituitaries of chinook and chum salmon. This paper describes results on the development and validation of a RIA suitable for the measurement of both plasma and pituitary immunoreactive PRL levels in salmonid fishes."
