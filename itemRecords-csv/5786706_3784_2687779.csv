10,Abstract:,"The relationship between sea-state intensity, sea-state duration and frequency is pursued in the context of wave data from five sites in U.S. waters. A methodology is presented for the interpolation and extrapolation of measured trends, based on extreme value series for intensity, given duration. The inevitable short duration database problem is addressed by routine application of the triple annual maximum methodology. A format is suggested for intensity-​duration-​frequency data preparation and presentation. Examples are given for wave climate data on the Pacific, Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States."
