9,Abstract:,"This paper presents a model of renewable resource exploitation that incorporates both intertemporal dynamics and spatial movement. The model combines the H. S. Gordon- Vernon Smith hypothesis of a rent dissipation process with Ricardian notions that resource are exploited across space in a pattern dependent upon relative profitabilities​. The population structure is characterized in a manner consistent with modern biological ideas that stress patchiness, heterogeneity, and interconnection​s among and between patches. Generally, the equilibrium patterns of biomass and effort across the system are found to be dependent upon bioeconomic conditions within each patch and the nature of the biological dispersal mechanism between patches. The authors use simple examples to illustrate how the distribution of effort throughout the system reflects the heterogeneity and the spatial biological linkages."
