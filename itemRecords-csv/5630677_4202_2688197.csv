9,Abstract:,"The development of models of diabetes mellitus in teleost fish, and in ectothermic vertebrates in general, has been impeded for several reasons. The anatomical feature of a single pancreatic endocrine (islet) organ devoid of exocrine tissues and separated from other vital organs in the goby, ""Gillichthys mirabilis"", allowed a relatively simple surgical isletectomy to be performed. Isletectomized (Ix) fish were then evaluated to determine whether the lack of islet hormones would cause the development of symptoms of insulin-​dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Ix fish did indeed develop symptoms typical of untreated IDDN in mammals. The establishment of this unique model of IDDM in an ectothermic vertebrate should prove valuable for future comparative studies on the role of insulin and other pancreatic factors in the regulation of metabolic and growth processes."
