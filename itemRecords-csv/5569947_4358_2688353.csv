10,Abstract:,"A profusion of interest in microbial loop processes has focused attention on the significance of protists in planktonic food webs. Ciliate protozoa are of particular interest as they have high specific growth rates, a spectrum of prey ranging from bacteria to metazoans, and can be prey for various larger zooplankton. Interest in the ciliate-​macrozooplankto​n link has led to development of an immunochemical method to investigate this prey-predator interaction in-situ. Addressed here are aspects of ciliate diet, growth rate, and growth efficiency in work preparatory to the development of that method."
