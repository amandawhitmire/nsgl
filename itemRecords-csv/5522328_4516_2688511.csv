10,Abstract:,"Sperm-egg interaction in the marine shrimp, ""Sicyonia ingentis"", differs from other systems in that the sperm are not motile and formation of a jelly layer on the egg does not occur until after eggs are spawned. The acrosome reaction (AR) in the sperm of ""S. ingentis"" can be induced in-vitro when sperm are incubated in egg water. Egg water (EW) was determined to possess a protein/carbohyâ€‹drate ratio of approximately 4:1 and contain trypsin-like proteolytic activity. Results of this study demonstrate that the two phases of the AR are elicited by separate inducers or inducing activities within EW and suggest a role for an EW trypsin-like proteolytic activity in filament formation."
