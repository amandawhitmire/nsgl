13,Abstract:,"The hunting-​mode–habitat-​domain-​range framework suggests that the mechanismdrivin​g trophic cascades (i.e., trait-mediated indirect interactions [TMIIs] vs. densitymediated​indirect interactions [DMIIs]) should depend upon the functional traits of predatorsand prey. For example, trophic cascades containing active, broad habitat domain range(BHDR) predators interacting with narrow habitat domain range (NHDR) prey are predictedto arise primarily via TMIIs, because these prey should reduce their conspicuous activity in thepresence of these predators. Unfortunately, this hypothesis is difficult to test given the strongbias against studies assessing trophic cascades containing NHDR prey. Furthermore, thishypothesis ignores evidence that (1) active predators can have high consumption rates on prey,(2) continuously responding to active predators foraging across broad areas is energeticallyco​stly for prey, and (3) cues from active, BHDR predators may not influence prey density. Weexamined the TMIIs and total indirect interaction (TII) produced during interactions betweenan active, BHDR ladybeetle predator (Naemia seriata) and its NHDR prey (scale insects). Weexposed scale insects to nonlethal and lethal ladybeetle predators in laboratory mesocosms for15 weeks. We measured the growth of the scale insect’s host plant (cordgrass) and the populationdensi​ty of scale insects. Contrary to theory, nonlethal ladybeetles did not induce TMIIs.However, lethal ladybeetles increased cordgrass total and root dry biomass by 36% and 44%,respectivel​y, suggesting the presence of strong DMIIs. Additionally, both lethal and nonlethalladybe​etles reduced scale insect population density. Our findings suggest that DMIIs, ratherthan TMIIs, can result from interactions between active BHDR predators and NHDR prey."
