16,Abstract:,"In the United States, development of hatchery technologies for the culture of white sturgeon (""Acipenser transmontanus"") has led to a small but growing commercial industry in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Among potential problems hindering the continued development of sturgeon aquaculture are viral diseases that cause mortality among fish at early life stages. One such virus, the white sturgeon iridovirus (WSIV), was first detected in cultured white sturgeon in California in 1988. The purpose of this report is: (1) to describe the WSIV epizootics that occurred in cultured white sturgeon from the lower Columbia River in Oregon, the Snake River in southern Idaho and the Kootenai River in northern Idaho; (2) to assimilate the epizootiologicaâ€‹l information and suggest sources of WSIV; and (3) to propose fish culture management strategies to minimize disease due to WSIV."
