9,Abstract:,"New methods are needed in order to study the relationship of subunit organization of alginate and other plant cell-wall carbohydrates to development and function at the cellular level. Here the gelling subunit of alginate, the major cell-wall polysaccharide of brown algae, was used as a molecular marker for identification of this cell-wall carbohydrate subunit at the cellular level. The specificity of the probe for gelling subunits was demonstrated by lack of cell-wall labelling in the absence of calcium, correlation between divalent-cation binding affinities of polyguluronate with labelling intensity, and lack of labelling by fluorescein-​conjugated nongelling subunits."
