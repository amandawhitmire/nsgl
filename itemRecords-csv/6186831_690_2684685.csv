14,Abstract:,"Information on high seas recoveries of salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) tagged with coded-wire tags (CWTs) has been reported annually to the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (1981-1992) and to the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC, 1993-present). Data from these CWT recoveries are also reported into the coastwide on-line CWT recovery database (http://www.rmp​c.org) maintained by the Regional Mark Processing Center (RMPC) of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC). This document lists recovery data for 89 CWT salmonids that will be reported to PSMFC/RMPC for the first time. These 89 CWTs were recovered from the 2006-2008 U.S. groundfish trawl fisheries in the Gulf of Alaska (21 Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and eastern Bering Sea- Aleutian Islands (7 Chinook salmon), from the 2007 Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) trawl fishery in the Northern Pacific Ocean off Washington/Oreg​on/California (WA/OR/CA, 52 Chinook salmon), from the limited-entry non-hake groundfish trawl off WA/OR/CA (7 Chinook salmon), and from 2005 and 2008 Japanese research vessel operations in the central North Pacific Ocean (2 steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss)."
