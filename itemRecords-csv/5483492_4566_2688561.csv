11,Abstract:,"Growth and feed efficiency of a fish species are the two most critical economic factors which determine the viability of its commercial production. When assessing various factors influencing the growth and feed efficiency of fishes, it was found that feeding rate, water temperature, and fish size were the three most important parameters. A previous study showed that the optimum feeding rate of juvenile (30-100 g) white sturgeon was 2.0% of their body weight (BW) per day. The results here suggest an optimal feeding rate between 1.5 and 2.0% BW/day for larger white sturgeon (between 0.25 and 0.5 kg) at 18 deg C."
