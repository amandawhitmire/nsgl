10,Abstract:,"The euryhaline Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, has the ability to live in both freshwater (FW) and saltwater (SW) environments. Prolactin (PRL) is a multifunctional hormone critical to promoting life in FW. In the absence of PRL, tilapia lose the capacity to osmoregulate in hypotonic environments. We investigated salinity control of PRL cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy in the tilapia, in vivo, where a nearly homogenous population of PRL cells are segregated within the rostral pars distalis (RPD). We found that the PRL region of a FW tilapia pituitary has a 3-fold larger volume than the PRL region of a SW fish. It is unclear whether this increased volume in the PRL cell region is due to larger lactotrophs (hypertrophy), more lactotrophs (hyperplasia), or both. Therefore, we evaluated if PRL cell proliferation and apoptosis might be sensitive to salinity. Freshwater tilapia were transferred to either SW or sham transferred to FW and SW fish were moved to either FW or SW over a time course of 7 days. Pituitaries of the tilapia were triple stained for determination of lactotroph cell density using nuclei staining with Hoescht dye, proliferation with BrdU labeling, and apoptosis using a TUNEL assay. Lactotrophs were identified by immunostaining using tilapia specific PRL antisera. Lactotroph cell densities were 40% lower in FW than SW fish and declined when fish were transferred from SW to FW (P < 0.001). There were negligible levels of apoptosis in lactotrophs and salinity was ineffective in regulating programmed cell death. By contrast, we found a dramatic effect of salinity on lactotroph cell proliferation. The pituitaries of FW tilapia show a higher rate of PRL cell proliferation than those of SW fish. During transfer from SW to FW, proliferation increased by approximately 20-fold compared with controls (P < 0.001). When fish were transferred from FW to SW, proliferation declined within 1 day to levels observed in sham transferred SW fish. The enhanced proliferation combined with increased volume of the pituitary PRL cell region, decline in lactotroph cell density, and presumed increase in cell volume, suggests that the tilapia lactotroph undergoes hypertrophy and hyperplasia in FW environments. Apoptosis appears to play little role in regulating lactotroph density under different salinities. Overall, these results suggest that the elevated production and content of PRL critical to life in FW is mediated, in part, through enhanced lactotroph proliferation and hypertrophy."
