9,Abstract:,"In response to an activation stimulus, which is normally provided by the fertilizing sperm, oocytes are activated to begin development. In this paper, it is shown that the resumption of meiotic maturation and the formation of the hatching envelope in the ova of the marine shrimp, ""S. ingentis"", are induced by contact with seawater and do not require fertilization."
