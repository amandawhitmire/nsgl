12,Abstract:,"What constitutes `successful' mitigation is highly controversial, and judgments may differ depending on the evaluation criteria used and the reference data or comparison sites. Neither the environmental nor the economic risks are trivial, and an improved evaluation process that would reduce errors in judgment should benefit both species and developers. Conclusive evidence that constructed wetlands can replace natural wetlands would facilitate restoration and enhancement efforts. Conclusive evidence that certain mitigation procedures cannot maintain resources would reduce economic losses by helping to resolve conflicts early in the planning process. This article presents a list of natural ecosystem functions that are especially important in southern California, along with recommendations for assessing success on the basis of wetland functioning. Measurements that should be taken to predict whether or not constructed wetlands will develop the functional values of more natural ecosystems are suggested."
