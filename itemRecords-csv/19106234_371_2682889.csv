13,Abstract:,"This unique field guide to marine mammals and sea turtles of Hawaii, California, Oregon, and Washington is ideal for use on boats, on beach walks, and in classrooms, offices, laboratories, and at home. Created by Kate Wynne, a leading marine mammal field biologist, the book is designed with the field scientist and boater in mind. The wire-o binding makes it easy to flip through the durable, waterproof pages and keep the book open to the desired page. Wynne describes the behavior of each species, as well as dive pattern, habitat, life history, and interactions with humans. She explains how to distinguish whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, sea lions, sea otters, and sea turtles, and notes evolutionary adaptations for life in the sea. Each animal is represented by color photographs and a beautiful, scientifically accurate color illustration, created by West Coast nature illustrator Garth Mix. Range maps show where each species occurs. Surface profile silhouettes are a great help for making positive identificationsâ€‹."
