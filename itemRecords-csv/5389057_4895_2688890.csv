8,Abstract:,"Evidence is presented that variations in currents affecting surface transport on a range of scales in space and time may explain considerable variability in the recruitment success of benthic invertebrates with pelagic larvae. Examples include (1) oceanic scale events such as El Nino, (2) latitudinal variations in wind-driven Ekman transport, (3) intermediate scale geographical effects, and (4) diversion of currents around and the `trapping' of water masses within a large kelp forest. These variations in surface transport patterns affect not only when and where larvae are carried but also their physical-â€‹chemical environment and planktonic food availability."
