13,Abstract:,"The role of prolactin in teleost osmoregulation has been firmly established for several euryhaline species, including the tilapia, ""Oreochromis mossambicus"". Whole-animal transepithelial potential (TEP) is affected by hormone treatment in other teleost species. The intent of this study is to determine (1) the response of whole-animal TEP of tilapia to rapid changes in environmental salinity and (2) the effects of hypophysectomy and subsequent replacement therapy with two prolactins on TEP, plasma osmolality, [Na+], [Cl-], and gill Na+,K+,-ATPase activity of tilapia adapted to 25% seawater and transferred to freshwater."
