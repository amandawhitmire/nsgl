9,Abstract:,"Rates of uptake of dissolved amino acids were determined for axenic veliger larvae of the bivalve ""Crassostrea gigas"" (70 um shell length). The experiments were designed to (1) compare the uptake of specific amino acids both individually and from mixtures, and (2) determine the relationship between influx and net flux for several substrates, representating acidic, basic, neutral and beta-amino acids (taurine)."
