12,Abstract:,"An energy budget relates the growth of an animal to its physiological condition and is one way to observe its energy partitioning for maintenance and growth in a new environment. ""Haliotus fulgens"" is a warm-water abalone found in seawater of 12-23 degrees C but tolerates temperatures up to 28 degrees C for short periods. ""H. tuberculata"" is a cold-water species found in seawater of 5-18 degrees C but shows accelerated growth when cultured in seawater near 20 degrees C. The authors of this study examine the energy budget parameters of ""H. fulgens"" and ""H. tuberculata"" under summer and winter conditions."
