11,Abstract:,"Atomic force microscopy is often limited by scan rates slower than the process being observed, especially if operated in tapping mode to reduce sample damage. Rapid imaging using tapping mode in fluids is discussed in this paper. Using small cantilever the author obtained sequential images of calcite crystal steps growing from a screw dislocation. Critical step lengths (the length of the shortest step that can advance) and step energy are also discussed."
