13,Abstract:,"From the observations that growth hormone (GH) promotes sulfate uptake in cartilage in-vivo but not in-vitro, and that GH injection increases the capacity of plasma to increase sulfate uptake in vitro, a mediator of the growth-â€‹promoting action of growth hormone was hypothesized. Subsequent research has demonstrated that the most important of these somatomedins is insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), an endocrine and paracrine factor that is produced in the liver and a variety of other tissues. Recent studies have also suggested that somatomedins may be important in the regulation of fish growth. This study investigates the endocrine factors regulating in-vitro sulfate uptake in a salmonid teleost."
