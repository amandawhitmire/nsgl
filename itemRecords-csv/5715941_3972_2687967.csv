11,Abstract:,"To ascertain how the initial signaling events that trigger larval metamorphosis are coupled to the global changes in gene regulation underlying cell specification and morphogenesis, the authors examine tissue-specific gene expression induced at metamorphosis in the gastropod ""Haliotis rufescens"" (red abalone). Analysis of mRNA accumulation in larvae and during metamorphosis reveals that chymotrypsin gene expression begins in a small population of larval digestive gland amoebocytes prior to metamorphosis and gut morphogenesis. Completion of the gut morphogenetic program then requires signaling events associated with metamorphosis."
