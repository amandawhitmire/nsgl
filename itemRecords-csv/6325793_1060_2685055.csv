14,Abstract:,"Microsatellite sequences were isolated from both non-enriched and enriched genomic libraries of California spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus. Eight consistently amplifying, scorable and polymorphic loci were characterized for 79 individuals collected at Santa Cruz and San Clemente Islands, California, and tested for crossspecies amplification in four closely related Panulirus spp., as well as four other species of the order Achelata. The number of alleles observed per locus ranged from three to 54 and observed heterozygositie​s ranged from 0.57 to 0.98. Quality control testing shows that all loci were reliably scorable, independently segregating, inherited in Mendelian ratios, and had low to moderate (B14.4%) frequencies of null alleles and high statistical power for detecting fine scale genetic structure."
