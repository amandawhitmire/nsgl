The program, scheduled to open to the public in 2002, makes use of the unique human and natural resources of the Monterey Bay (California) region to provide a high-quality and fun learning experience. S.E.A. Lab will also serve as a laboratory for student teaching, in-service training, and curriculum development and delivery."
