10,Abstract:,"A specimen of ""Fascaplysinopi​s"" sp. from Palau contained palauolide, fascaplysin, and a new sesterterpene, palauolol. The structure and absolute stereochemisty of palauolol were determined using spectroscopic and chemical methods and in doing so, the absolute stereochemistry of palauodlide was also determined. Palauolide and palauolol both inactivate bee venom phospholipase A-2."
