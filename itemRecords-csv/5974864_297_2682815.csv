14,Abstract:,"This publication contains new information on useful seaweeds, valuable for anyone interested in aquaculture, natural products chemistry, biogeography, population genetics, phylogenetics, ecology, biotechnology, conservation biology, and taxonomy. Results from the May 2002 international workshop on economically useful marine plants held in Hilo, Hawaii, are reported by seaweed taxonomists from nine countries. These include 19 papers on ""Caulerpa"", ""Dictyota"", ""Gelidiella"", ""Gelidium"", ""Gracilaria"", ""Halymenia"", ""Hypnea"", ""Laurencia"", and ""Sargassum"" that contain descriptions of new species, observations on the type material (for genus ""Halymenia""), results of molecular, morphological, and anatomical studies, information on the nutritional composition of Hawaiian ""Gracilaria"", checklists, new records, and a special chapter on taxonomy and nomenclature. Available as a book or CD-ROM."
