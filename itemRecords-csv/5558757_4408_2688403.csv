9,Abstract:,"During 1945 to 1970 the U.S. undertook a series of important initiatives for scientific research on marine fisheries in the Pacific Basin. In time these were formally integrated or coordinated, and eventually led to the emerging unification of marine biology and fisheries studied with physical and chemical oceanography. This paper examines the relationship of these projects to American strategic and commercial objectives in the postwar era, showing how new international fisheries management programs based on the maximum sustained yield concept and established by multinational treaties embodied U.S. planners' design to protect the growth and stability of American fisheries interests as well as U.S. strategic objectives."
