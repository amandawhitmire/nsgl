10,Abstract:,"Naturally occurring toxins which may accumulate in bivalve shellfish can cause temporary paralysis and even death. Clams, mussels, oysters and scallops have been involved in outbreaks of PSP in California. It is impossible to distinguish between toxic and safe shellfish, and normal cooking methods do not destroy the toxins. Bivalve shellfish eat by filtering dinoflagellates and other organisms from the water. The toxins produced by the dinoflagellate ""Alexandrium catenella"" do not harm shellfish. However, the toxins can harm man and other animals when they eat toxic shellfish. Abalone, crab, shrimp and fish do not feed on ""Alexandrium"" and do not become toxic. Safety tips for shellfish gathering are listed."
