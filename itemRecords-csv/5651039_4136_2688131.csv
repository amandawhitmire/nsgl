10,Abstract:,"A framework is developed for the interactions among the diverse groups involved in operational fisheries oceanography: fishing industry, basic and operational researchers, and tactical and strategic stock assessment managers. The basis for these interactions is the need for accurate and timely information, information so complex and diverse that no simple sector of the community can efficiently and economically satisfy its own information requirements. Some presently available remotely- sensed data and analysis methods that have potential for providing part of the required information are presented. Projections of future capabilities in this area also are made. The increased use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and near-real-time communication networks among the various sectors of the community also is discussed."
