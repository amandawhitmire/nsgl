8,Abstract:,"Bathymetric sidescan sonar systems offer the potential for high-resolution mapping of the ocean bottom at a substantial reduction in survey cost. However, data obtained to date from bathymetric sidescan systems are not considered sufficiently accurate to meet the required hydrographic standards. Here, a realistic sonar simulation program is used to study the performance limitations of such systems. The statistical behavior of the phase difference between the backscattered return received by vertically separated transducer elements in the presence of sloping bottom features, volume reverberation and ambient noise is reported on."
