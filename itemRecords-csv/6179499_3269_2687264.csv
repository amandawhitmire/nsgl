9,Abstract:,"The field of genomics has revolutionized modern biotechnology. Its application to natural product research has opened new doors to drug discovery and development through genome mining and metabolic engineering. Over the past few years we have focused on the biosynthesis and bioengineering of microbial natural products from marine sediment-â€‹derived actinomycetes. The recent genome sequence analysis of two obligate marine actinomycetes belonging to the newly established genus Salinispora has revealed rich and metabolically diverse secondary metabolic capabilities that exceed 10% of their genomes. Using bioinformatics as our guide, we have been able to discover new natural product chemistry and novel biosynthetic processes as well as generate new chemical entities via gene engineering. The utility of genome sequencing in the natural product discovery and development process will be presented in this lecture with several examples from Salinispora tropica and Salinispora arenicola."
