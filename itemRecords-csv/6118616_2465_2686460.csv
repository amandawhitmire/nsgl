10,Abstract:,"Apogon seminigracaudus is a small, red, semitransparent cardinalfish with blackish coloration on the caudal peduncle and lower caudal-fin lobe. This species was first illustrated by Jordan and Seale (1906) and misidentified as Apogon fuscus (Quoy and Gaimard). Subsequent workers followed this misidentificati​on, and the species has remained undescribed for over 100 years. Apogon seminigracaudus is in the subgenus Apogon, and shares a distinctive structure around the anterior nostril with A. doryssa, A. lativittatus, and A. semiornatus. It has 13 pectoral-fin rays, usually 4 + 14 gill rakers, and one and a half scales between the lateral line and center of the first dorsal fin. It is known from Japan, Ryukyu Islands, Ogasawara Islands, Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa. In 1906, Jordan and Seale, in their Fishes of Samoa, illustrated a cardinalfish they identified as Amia fusca (Quoy and Gaimard) (Jordan and Seale 1906:244, fig. 38) (Fig. 1). They had a single specimen from Apia. This illustration shows a fish with black markings on the caudal peduncle and lower half of the caudal fin, and they commented on its distinct coloration. Subsequent to their identification of their specimen as Amia fusca, later workers followed suit and used the name Apogon fuscus for this species (Kuiter and Kozawa 1999; Hayashi 2002). While conducting a survey of the marine fishes of Fiji, I collected over twenty lots of this small, red cardinalfish with a blackish caudal peduncle and black pigment on the lower half of the caudal fin. In attempting to identify these specimens, I investigated the name A. fuscus that had previously been applied to this species. Because the name fuscus has also been associated with the Apogon bandanensis group (Myers 1989), I contacted T.H. Fraser who is revising that group, and he informed me (pers. commun., 31 Jan. 2007) that in a future publication he will be treating A. fuscus as a valid species within the bandanensis group. Earlier, I had concluded that the use of A. fusca by Jordan and Seale (1906) was a misidentificati​on (Greenfield 2001). In a revision of the Apogon erythrinus complex (Greenfield 2001), I discussed all of the semitransparent red cardinalfish species that have been described. The only name that is not accounted for is Apogon arenatus Bleeker (1859-60). Bleeker based his description on a drawing by Castelnau (location unknown), and there is no holotype. The color description Bleeker gives does not match that of the species in question, which was first illustrated by Jordan and Seale (1906). Three additional recently described species, Apogon lativittatus (Randall, 2001) and Apogon kauteame and Apogon rubrifuscus (Greenfield and Randall, 2004), also are not this species. Thus, although this species has been illustrated several times, it remained undescribed for over 100 years. The purpose of this paper is to describe the species as Apogon seminigracaudus​."
