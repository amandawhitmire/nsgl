9,Abstract:,"Some explanation of the title of this paper is obviously necessary. To the modern marine phycologist, the algal culture dish is a common research tool. In contrast the number of studies dealing with in situ phycological exploration in the sea are few. An attempt will be made here to show how advantageous it is to look beyond the confines of the culture dish at benthic marine algae in situ, and conceptually to bridge the gap that exists between the artificial world in the culture dish and the real world in the sea. There are those who assume that ecological studies are necessarily descriptive and correlative rather than experimental, and that a truly experimental approach is one, like that used in many culture dish studies, where all of the conditions save one are held constant, a situation that one could scarcely hope to duplicate in the sea. Nonetheless, it is possible to carry out experimental work under natural conditions by allowing all conditions save one to vary naturally. The author focuses on work that he has shared with past and present colleagues along the Pacific Coast of North America and hope to demonstrate that the technical problems of working in the sea are not insurmountable. He feels that it will be quite possible to use in the sea many of the techniques that have been used in the laboratory."
