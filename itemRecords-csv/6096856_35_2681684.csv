11,Abstract:,"The National Sea Grant College Program, a network of 31 university-​based programs, is dedicated to enhancing the understanding, conservation, and sustainable use of the nation's coastal and marine resources. It has facilities and staff in every coastal and Great Lakes state, with activities funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Matching funds come from the individual states, and additional support from a variety of private sources. The Sea Grant programs of today focus on making this country a world leader in marine research and the sustainable development of marine and coastal resources. To this end, they produce and make available a wealth of information on these topics, from school curriculum materials to the most advanced scientific research. California Sea Grant College Program, the largest of these 31 programs, draws on the talents of scientists and engineers at public and private universities throughout the state. It is administered by the University of California and is based at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. California Sea Grant contributes to the growing body of knowledge about coastal and marine resources and helps solve contemporary marine-related problems through its sponsored research. It supports graduate education by funding trainees who work with marine scientists and engineers on a diversity of subject areas. Through its outreach and communications components, developments in information and technology are transferred to stakeholders. Our Extension personnel, in partnership with UC Cooperative Extension (UCCE), play a major role in the link between university, industry and the public. The research funded is selected on the basis of competitive, peer-reviewed proposals and addresses a wide range of problems and opportunities. This Program Directory provides summaries of the projects funded in 2008 by California Sea Grant. Further information on any of these projects is available by contacting our offices, or visiting the program web site http://www.csgc​.ucsd.edu."
