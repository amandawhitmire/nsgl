Cultural, institutional, and practical barriers can impede or bias that process. Recognizing this gap, and incentivized by funders, academic researchers increasingly collaborate beyond their disciplines and institutions and use stakeholder engagement in studies informing natural resources and ecosystems management. The NSF-funded “Climate Change and Water Sustainability – Willamette Water 2100” (WW2100) project brings together scientists from 12 disciplines in a co-learning realm with a diverse array of water users, managers, and regulators to develop and model future climate, population, and land-use policy scenarios to predict where, when, and how water scarcity might manifest and, in turn, how ecosystems, disturbances, and land-use may be impacted. This research characterizes the scientist-​stakeholder engagement process through three principle questions: 1) Who is participating? 2) Why are participants involved in this project? 3) What are the participants’ perceptions of the project’s process and outcome? Through a mixed methods approach including semi-structured interviews of key informants and survey data from a self-selected sample of the research and stakeholder population, this research takes a grounded-theory approach to understand the social dynamics and the outcome of a large transdisciplina​ry NSF project.","Ferguson, Laura;Chan, Sam;Santelmann, Mary;Tilt, Bryan",ORESU-WR-14-012,ORESU-WR-14-012,A/ESG-07,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2014,Oregon Sea Grant,"Can long-term engagement in learning and action networks lead to a stakeholder-​scientist ""happily ever after""?

A study examined the ability of implicit dimensions of risk perception and explicit feelings to predict behavior relevant to tsunami debris. 44 visitors to a marine museum on the Oregon coast were given separate single-category IATs measuring distinct affective dimensions of perceived risk (danger/safety, afraid/unafraid​, dread/calm) towards such debris, similar explicit measures, and items assessing behavioral intentions towards tsunami debris. Results indicated that on average participants had weakly negative implicit attitudes towards tsunami debris, that explicit and implicit attitudes were relatively unrelated, and that the less informed people were the more negative their implicit attitudes. However, this was unrelated to an interest in gaining more information about debris. Overall, explicit attitudes predicted behavioral variables most strongly. The ability of different implicit dimensions of risk perception to predict behavior relevant to beach debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami was examined. U.S. coastal visitors were given IATs measuring three affective risk dimensions. Less informed people were had more negative implicit attitudes.

However, in the past decade the development of natural products into new therapeutics has dwindled, in part due to the challenges posed by high rediscovery rates and low throughput associated with classical bioassay-guided fractionation methods. Recent research shows that most microbes express only a fraction of their total biosynthetic potential under standard monophyletic culture conditions. The research presented here focuses on applying new cultivation and analytical methodology to marine cyanobacteria and the relatively unexplored microbial communities inhabiting deep sea-​hydrothermal vents (DSV). The former group yielded two new antimalarial depsipeptides, ​ companeramides A and B, and two new members of the lyngbyaloside group of glycoside macrolides, with further analogues of each class identified by mass spectral networking of cyanobacterial extracts. A rapid, plate-based fractionation and screening approach was applied to DSV bacteria, along with co-​cultivation methodology, to identify new biologically active molecules and the role of these molecules in bacterial interactions was explored by imaging mass spectrometry.","Vining, Oliver B.",ORESU-Y-15-001,ORESU-Y-15-001,R/BT-52,theses/disserta​tions,2015,Oregon Sea Grant,Biologically active metabolites from marine microorganisms: methods to identify drug leads and chemical signals,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The hydrodynamic climate in estuarine waters is controlled by multiple factors such as boundary conditions offshore (tides, waves), across the surface (winds), at the upper estuary margin (streamflow), as well as mean sea level. On the decadal to century scale, climate change modulated variability in these forcings will drastically effect state of the overall system resulting in changes to experienced extreme water level events. A study of climate change impacts on two Pacific Northwest estuaries is presently underway. ADCIRC-SWAN is being used to conduct multi-decadal simulations of water levels across the study estuaries. A GCM-RCM configuration was selected from the NARCCAP project and then bias-corrected against the observation-​based NARR data. This was separated into two data streams (historical and future) which were then run through a set of models in order to develop forcing for ADCIRC-SWAN. At the open ocean boundary, the model is forced with wave output from the WaveWatch III model. The free surface of the model is forced with surface winds and pressure. The streamflow boundaries are forced with hydrographs obtained from the Micromet - Snowmodel - Hydroflow suite of runoff routing models. The ADCIRC-SWAN output provides time series data on total water levels (TWLs) throughout the model domain. These time series can be used to construct CDFs of water elevation at any site of interest and also to derive return periods for extreme water level events. Of particular interest to this study is how these products change from the historical to future runs and which processes (changing offshore waves, changing streamflow) are primarily responsible for the observed changes in flooding characteristics​.","Parker, K.;Cheng, T.;Hill, D.;Beamer, J.;Garcia, G.",ORESU-WR-14-014,ORESU-WR-14-014,R/CNH-25,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2014,Oregon Sea Grant,The impacts of climate-change on estuarine flooding: a Pacific Northwest case study (poster presentation.),NA,NA,"American Geophysical Union Meeting, poster presentation, San Francisco, California, December 15-19, 2014",NA,NA,NA,NA

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/11681602_3420_2816434.csv,10,"Migration in animals has evolved as an adaptation to environmental variability across space and through time. The availability of reliable sensory cues and guidance mechanisms used in navigating among disparate locations is an essential component of this behavior. An “inherited magnetic map” is navigational solution that has evolved in some marine animals that, without prior experience or guidance from older conspecifics, migrate to oceanic foraging grounds. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that navigationally naïve salmon encountering magnetic fields characteristic of certain regions along their migratory route will bias their swimming in a particular direction. Simulations of this behavior within realistic models of oceanic circulation suggest that such behavior is highly adaptive, making the migratory route more predictable and facilitating movement into favorable oceanic regions. Such behavior is possible due to the spatial gradients of components of the geomagnetic field (e.g., the inclination angle of field lines and the total field intensity) that provide a bicoordinate grid across much of the Earth’s surface. However, this environmental feature is not static, but experiences gradual and unpredictable changes that can be substantial over successive generations. Thus, drift of the geomagnetic field, in addition to variable oceanic conditions, could play a major role in shaping the distribution of marine taxa that are dependent upon such mechanisms for migratory guidance. Several possibilities are discussed for how animals might mitigate the effects of geomagnetic drift, such as calibrating their inherited magnetic map relative to the field in which they develop. Further exploration of the dynamics of the geomagnetic field in context of animal navigation is a promising avenue for understanding the how animals deal with an ever-changing environment.","Putman, Nathan F.",ORESU-R-15-004,ORESU-R-15-004,R/RCF-31,reprints (peer-reviewed),2015,Oregon Sea Grant,Inherited magnetic maps in salmon and the role of geomagnetic change.,NA,NA,"Integrative and Comparative Biology, pp. 1-10, Advance Access doi: 10.1093/icb/icv​020, April 16, 2015 [Thinking About Change: An Integrative Approach for Examining Cognition in a Changing World, symposium presentation at the annual meeting of the SOciety for Integrative and Comparative Biology, West Palm Beach, Florida, January 3-7, 2015]",NA,10.1093/icb/icv​020,NA,NA

This catch volume is partly influenced by collection methods that cause mortality. Barotrauma in fish resulting fromforced ascent from depth can contribute to post-collection mortality. However, implementing decompression stops during ascent can prevent barotrauma. Conversely, venting (puncturing the swim bladder to release expanded internal gas) following ascent can mitigate some signs of barotrauma like positive buoyancy. Here, we evaluate how decompression and venting affect stress and mortality in the Yellow Tang (Zebrasoma flavescens). We examined the effects of three ascent treatments, each with decompression stops of varying frequency and duration, coupled with or without venting, on sublethal effects and mortality using histology and serum cortisol measurements. In fish subjected to ascent without decompression stops or venting, a mean post-collection mortality of 6.2% occurred within 24 h of capture. Common collection methods in the fishery, ascent without decompression stops coupled with venting, or one long decompression stop coupled with venting, resulted in no mortality. Histopathologic examination of heart, liver, head kidney, and swim bladder tissues in fish 0d and 21d post-collection revealed no significant barotraumaor venting-​related lesions in any treatment group. Ascent without decompression stops resulted in significantly higher serum cortisol than ascent with many stops, while venting alone did not affect cortisol.

Downscaled general circulation model outputs indicate warming temperatures through the century, but similar precipitation totals and timing. Although climate change is likely to significantly reduce snow pack, which will reduce summer stream flow, snowmelt currently makes up less than 20% of the basin’s water budget in any month. In the lowlands, although total urban water demand will increase due to population and income growth, the accompanying expansion of urban areas into previously irrigated farmland mean that consumptive water use in parts of the basin may, in fact, decrease in the 21st century. However, deeper summer drought may become common, particularly at higher elevations. Cascade-sourced stream flows may become less reliable in late summer, and higher elevation soils may become drier.

We conducted an online survey with educational and veterinary pet owners in Washington, Oregon, and California to assess the current use, disposal, and drivers of pet and human PPCPs. Our research reveals that the majority of pet owners do not finish their pet and human PPCPs. Unused PPCPs are primarily disposed of in the garbage, to a lesser degree flushed, and the remaining are stored indefinitely, leading to future disposal issues. The desires to (1) minimize PPCPs in the water and (2) avoid accidental poisonings are the highest-ranked motivations driving proper pet PPCPs stewardship. The highest-rated solutions were more environmentally friendly PPCPs alternatives, easier access to PPCPs collection, and providing disposal information on product labeling. Understanding the drivers and environmental outcomes of this issue can lead to more-effective programs, studies, and policies on PPCPs use and disposal and help minimize further impacts on the environment.","Lam, Jennifer;Chan, Samuel;Conway, Flaxen;Stone, Dave",ORESU-WR-14-019,ORESU-WR-14-019,A/ESG-07,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2014,Oregon Sea Grant,Dose of reality: what can we learn from pet owners to guide more effective environmental stewardship of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs)?

However, empirical evidence suggests that a predator’s diet can also be influenced by a variety of environmental factors, including interactions with other predators. We used diet and abundance data from National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) bottom trawl surveys for three groundfish predators (Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria)) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) to determine whether temperature or other species influence the consumption of walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus). Using an informationtheo​retic approach, we tested for relationships between walleye pollock observed in predator stomachs and predator length, bottom temperature, prey availability (walleye pollock catch per unit effort (CPUE) scaled by observed prey lengths), and CPUE of the three predators and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias). Predator length was positively related to walleye pollock presence and proportion of total diet mass in all predators. Increased temperatures negatively affected consumption of walleye pollock by Pacific halibut, but not the other predators. We found evidence for a number of interpredator effects of co-occurring predators, both positive (facultative) and negative (competitive). Surprisingly, observed prey density was not statistically significant with respect to consumption for these predators, suggesting that trawls sample the environment far differently than walleye pollock predators or species interactions are more complex than those used in previous multispecies models.

If hypoxic events are severe enough to cause marine species mortality, the areas affected are often called “dead zones.” In 2002 and again in 2006, the events were lethal, resulting in mass invertebrate and fish kills. Many organisms are impacted by these events, but less mobile juvenile fishes and crabs are potentially more vulnerable to the long-term effects of these stressful conditions than adults. Little is known about how low DO impacts coastal fishes and invertebrates, especially during the juvenile phase. Nursery habitats in the nearshore open-coast and enclosed estuaries may be differentially ​ affected by hypoxia by prevailing summertime oceanographic conditions. Both ecosystems are critical for the early development of many ecologically and commercially important species. While one habitat may be compromised by stressful environmental conditions, the other may provide refuge. In upwelling driven areas, low dissolved oxygen is typically coupled with colder water, while in estuarine or semi-enclosed systems, dissolved oxygen diminishes with increasing temperatures. Temperature and dissolved oxygen are known to have interactive effects on fish behavior and physiology, which underscores the importance of studying hypoxia within different systems and in relation to other co-​occurring environmental variables. In order to isolate the effects of these parameters on growth, I conducted three experiments over the course of two years on juvenile Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) and English sole (Parophrys vetulus). During each experiment, I held English sole in the lab in fixed oxygen and temperature conditions for at least thirty days, and Dungeness crab for approximately fifty. I tested a total of 15 oxygen and temperature treatment combinations, with at least two replicates of each treatment. These treatments simulated summertime oceanographic conditions that are typically found in two nursery habitats used by these species: the Yaquina Bay estuary and Moolack Beach, Oregon USA. English sole specific growth (g d-1) increased with higher temperatures (13 and 15°C) and oxygen concentrations (2.0 and 6.0 mL L-1) and was up to four times lower in all low temperature and oxygen treatments (5 and 7°C; < 1.4 mL L-1). Dungeness crab intermolt period decreased with temperature from 48 days at 5°C to 12 days at 15°C. Crab specific growth (mm d-1) increased with temperature, with crabs in the highest temperatures growing nearly five times as much as crabs in the coldest temperatures. Finally, if people have heard of hypoxia, it is commonly in relation to the condition found in the Gulf of Mexico, which is nutrient driven and can be traced to anthropogenic input. Instead, Oregon hypoxia is more difficult to trace directly to human-​related activity, making West Coast hypoxia a relatively lesser understood occurrence. In order to share the results of my research and improve general public understanding of hypoxia, I designed a ~3:00 minute video exhibit that was displayed at the Hatfield Marine Science Center Visitor Center.

Truly understanding the social-​ecological system requires considering the entire “human dimension” and this includes the social, cultural, and legal/policy aspects as well. An understudied yet important factor is women’s contribution to fishing at the family and community level. There is a national and international understanding that if we are to understand and develop strategies for coastal resilience, we must take a holistic approach that includes an understanding of the intersection between the dynamics of fisheries management and women’s participation within fishing. This research directly addresses this intersection. The objective of this study was to collect oral history data related to past/current strategies for addressing fishing family and community resilience over time. Literature has documented ways in which limited access and catch share programs affect fishing community resilience and sustainability, but have few data that look at how these management systems may be affecting women’s roles and participation within the industry. This work takes a closer look at the role of women in adapting to this impact and other market- and management-​driven changes on the Oregon coast. A qualitative approach was used to identify and document the historical and current changes and related coping strategies occurring in Oregon’s coastal communities. Data were collected, transcribed and analyzed for the Voices from the West Coast Project (VFWC), a collaborative project with Oregon State University (OSU), NOAA’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) and Newport Fishermen’s Wives (NFW). The themes developed in this study were meant to be representative of what was important and true to the participants involved in the project. ‘Complexity’ and ‘resilience’ were two of the larger abstract themes created to illustrate the common concerns and actions of women in Oregon’s commercial fishing industry. ‘Connections’ and ‘marriage and family roles’ were more descriptive themes of how women identified themselves within the fishing industry and the types of social networks that evolved out of community connections. Overall, women mentioned changes in their individual roles managing the family business, especially as regulations became more complex and family dynamics changed over time. Individual adaptive strategies were especially common among fishing families that owned quota shares.

This dissertation consists of three essays: two essays use disaggregated economic-​engineering data to address spatial heterogeneity in economic losses and regional interdependenci​es for Tsunami impact assessment and resilience planning in State of Oregon. The third essay uses disaggregated retail-store data to address the issues of estimation biasness using aggregated annual household purchase data in fresh fruit demand analysis. The first essay presents an integrated engineering-​economic impact assessment of a potential major Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) Tsunami event on Clatsop County, a coastal county in State of Oregon. The model addresses spatial heterogeneities of physical damages and economic activities by integrating an engineering simulation using Method of Splitting Tsunami (MOST) with a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. I find the integrated model predicts different economic losses and rankings of vulnerable sectors comparing to non-integrated model. The differences in economic impact assessment will lead to different allocation of disaster-relief resources and prioritization of vulnerable industry sectors in the regional disaster resilience plan. The second essay develops an algorithm to spatially disaggregate the county-level transaction data into two sub-county regions, one of which is spatially aligned with the irregular spatial extent of the potential damage from natural disasters. Using the derived sub-county regional transaction data as the input, a Sub-County, Multi-regional CGE model is built to address spatially concentrated risks and cross-regional interdependenci​es within the jurisdictional boundaries. Comparing to County CGE model, Multi-Regional CGE predicts less economic losses in energy sector but more losses in health sector, due to imbalanced cross-regional trades within jurisdictional boundaries. To support the design of Oregon Resilience Plan, a case study of evaluating impacts of relocating a major health service facility out of inundation zone is also carried out using the multi-regional model. The third essay performs a demand analysis of both conventional and organic fruit at the retail level, using a disaggregated store-level retail data. The study address the issues of estimation biasness using home-scan data due to annual aggregation of household purchases, inconsistent consumption bundles and missing price information of zero purchases.

Years later they return to their natal streams with remarkable accuracy and precision. The outward migration is accomplished without the benefit of following experienced migrants or prior individual experience. Evidence suggests that Pacific salmon and trout use the earth’s geomagnetic fields when undertaking these migrations. My study evaluated current hatchery and management practices that may influence the ability of Pacific steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to perceive or respond to geomagnetic fields. Magnetized coded wire tags (CWT) were implanted into Alsea river steelhead pre-smolts (juveniles that have not undergone the physiological transition to prepare for oceanic life stage) during the fall of 2013. Test subjects were exposed to simulated magnetic fields at the latitudinal periphery of their oceanic foraging range in the North Pacific. Orientation responses were recorded and compared to non-tagged individuals. However, due to fish illness or other factors, control test subjects did not exhibit the north/south orientation responses observed during previous studies and results were inconclusive. Magnetic susceptibility, total magnetic field intensity, and median destructive field were assessed by analyzing 48 CWTs from five injection units. The total field intensity was consistent among machines and tags within a single machine. The strength of the fields produced by the tags relative to the known magnetic sensitivity of steelhead trout suggest that they are unlikely to pose major problems for large-scale navigation in fish. Sex differences in geomagnetic orientation response were evaluated based on work that documented early movement downstream by female steelhead. Experiments documented no significant difference in geomagnetic orientation responses based on genetic sex, though these results may also have been confounded by the same problems associated with the CWT orientation experiments. Lastly, effects of rearing juvenile steelhead in concrete raceways (subject to magnetic distortion due to iron rebar) were examined following similar ""simulated magnetic displacement"" protocols. These juvenile steelhead exhibited random orientation responses. The inability of fish reared in raceways to distinguish between fields at the periphery of their oceanic foraging range could pose potential problems for homing and navigation in hatchery fishes. The duration of these affects is unknown and warrants further study. Based on these findings, there is evidence to suggest that some current hatchery and management practices may influence the ability of juvenile salmon and trout to perceive geomagnetic fields. In turn, this may influence successful navigation to foraging grounds in the Pacific, subsequent return rates, as well as homing and straying behavior.","Scanlan, Michelle M.",ORESU-Y-15-005,ORESU-Y-15-005,R/RCF-31,theses/disserta​tions,2015,Oregon Sea Grant,An evaluation of the effects of hatchery and management practices on geomagnetic orientation behavior in juvenile Pacific steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,"Master of Science, Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here the effect of this directional asymmetry on the net wave-induced radiation stresses is analyzed. The net radiation stresses are calculated for a shoaled JONSWAP frequency spectrum with both symmetric and asymmetric directional distributions and then compared with those calculated from the commonly-used monochromatic formulation (appropriate for spectra that are narrow-banded in frequency and directions). Past studies have demonstrated that the use of the monochromatic approximation in radiation stress calculations results in a significant overestimation of the radiation stress components Sxx and Sxy in broad-banded seas. The present results show that the inclusion of directional asymmetry in radiation stress calculations reduces this overestimation for Sxx but increases the overestimation for Sxy for a range of dominant wave directions. Thus, directional asymmetry is an additional factor that contributes to overestimation when the monochromatic approximation is used for Sxy and can therefore also lead to an overestimation of associated parameters such as alongshore current velocities and alongshore sediment transport rates.","O'Dea, Annika;Haller, Merrick C.",ORESU-R-15-008,ORESU-R-15-008,E/INT-128,reprints (peer-reviewed),2015,Oregon Sea Grant,Effect of asymmetric directional spreading on the total radiation stress,NA,http://dx.doi.o​rg/10.1061/(ASC​E)WW.1943-​5460.0000305,"Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal, and Ocean Engineering, (06015004), doi: 10.1061/(ASCE)W​W.1943-​5460.0000305, published online June 10, 2015",NA,10.1061/(ASCE)W​W.1943-​5460.0000305,American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),NA

The aims of this chapter are to present an overview of myxozoan disease dynamics in the context of climate change, and to illustrate how these might be predicted over the next several decades by developing a case study of disease dynamics of Ceratonova (syn Ceratomyxa) shasta in the Klamath River, California USA. Our case study introduces a model ensemble for predicting changes in disease dynamics under different climate scenarios (warm/dry, moderate/median​, and cool/wet) from 2020 to 2060. The ensemble uses Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and basin scaled models for the Klamath River to generate predictions for future water temperature and river discharge. The environmental data are used as inputs for a predictive model and a degree day model to simulate effects of climate change on polychaete host populations and on C. shasta spore viability, respectively. Outputs from these models were then used to parameterize an epidemiological model to predict changes in disease dynamics under each climate scenario. The epidemiological​ model outputs were measured against baselines established using real data for low (2006), high (2008) and intermediate (2011) disease risk years. In general, the epidemiological model predicts that except for infrequent high discharge years, C. shasta dynamics will be similar to the high disease risk baseline (2008). This suggests that the recovery and management of Klamath River salmon will continue to be impacted by C. shasta.","Ray, R.

Although this threat has considerable implications for communities, it is unclear which organizations or entities have the responsibility and capacity to address economic vulnerability to hazards. Economic development and emergency management are often isolated from each other, resulting in emergency plans that do not serve the business community as well as they might otherwise, and economic development plans that do not address business needs related to disasters. One way to think about strengthening the local economy and reducing its vulnerability to disruption from hazards is through the lens of resilience, or the ability of a system to anticipate, absorb, recover from and adapt to stresses. This study explores the potential role of economic development plans in addressing the resilience of local economies to natural hazards. Through the evaluation of ten economic development plans from a three-­‐county region and supporting interviews, this study analyzes how well economic development plans currently address economic resilience to hazards, and how they might address it in the future.

Ocean acidification (OA) has received worldwide attention from researchers, media, and the public as an urgent environmental and economic issue. Increasing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion, land use change, and other human activities result in increased CO2 being absorbed by the ocean. OA makes it harder for coral, phytoplankton, shellfish, and other marine organisms to build their shells and skeletal structures. Shellfish larvae are especially sensitive to acidified waters during critical, early life-stage development. Ocean acidification is happening quickly, and this rapid pace of change gives marine ecosystems and coastal stakeholders less time to adapt.

In 2009 seven harbor seals, Phoca vitulina, stranded along the California coast from a similar brain disease of unknown cause of death (UCD). We evaluated the differences between the virome and microbiome of UCDs and harbor seals with known causes of death. Here we determined that UCD stranded animals had no viruses in their brain tissue. However, in the bacterial community, we identified Burkholderia and Coxiella burnetii as important pathogens associated with this stranding event. Burkholderia were 100% prevalent and ~2.8 log2 fold more abundant in the UCD animals. Further, while C. burnetii was found in only 35.7% of all samples, it was highly abundant (~94% of the total microbial community) in a single individual. In this harbor seal, C. burnetii showed high transcription rates of invading and translation genes, implicating it in the pathogenesis of this animal.

In the California Current System, a prototypical eastern boundary current, attention has been focused on explaining the trend of increasing shelf hypoxia. Despite the regional focus on hypoxia in eastern boundary regions, relatively few studies have examined smaller estuarine systems. Here, we present results from an observational study in Coos Bay, a small estuary on the southern Oregon coast, subject to seasonal upwelling/downw​elling winds, strong tides, and wide fluctuations in freshwater input. Coos Bay exhibits characteristics of a salt-wedge type estuary under high river discharge conditions, a well-mixed estuary under low discharge conditions, and partially mixed estuary during times of moderate discharge. The observed vertical stratification and along-estuary salinity gradients correlate significantly with river discharge and tidal forcing. Despite a strong coupling with coastal waters where hypoxia has been present, we do not find evidence for pervasive hypoxia in Coos Bay. We find that upwelling on the shelf advects low dissolved oxygen water into the estuary on synoptic timescales. Early in the upwelling season (April and May), dissolved oxygen minima are found at the estuary mouth, while later in the summer (September), dissolved oxygen minima are found at the riverine end, presumably due to decreased discharge and increased productivity. However, in a given year, the overall strength of the upwelling season is not a good predictor of low dissolved oxygen levels in the estuary.","Sutherland, David A.;O'Neill, Molly A.",ORESU-R-16-001,ORESU-R-16-001,R/ECO-28,reprints (peer-reviewed),2016,Oregon Sea Grant,Hydrographic and dissolved oxygen variability in a seasonal Pacific Northwest estuary,NA,NA,"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 172:47-59, 2016",NA,10.1016/j.ecss.​2106.01.042,Elsevier,NA

PMEC will consist of two nearshore sites, one north (NETS) and one south (SETS) of the Yaquina River, Oregon. Our study aims to assess how the development of wave energy sites might impact marine birds. We used vessel-based strip transect surveys to detect spatial and temporal patterns of seabirds during 28 surveys of NETS and SETS from 2013-2015. We also conducted 29 surveys along the Newport Hydrographic Line (NHL) (2006-2009, 2013-2015), a cross-shelf oceanographic sampling line that extends 40 km west of NETS. We collected in situ measurements of surface conductivity, temperature and fluorescence to test correlations between spatial variables and seabird abundance. Common murres (Uria aalge) were the most abundant resident species (70%) while sooty shearwaters (Puffinus griseus) were the most abundant migratory species (78%). We identified 7 focal species (common murres, sooty shearwaters, Brandt’s and pelagic cormorants (Phalacrocorax penicillatus and pelagicus), western gull (Larus occidentalis), Cassin’s auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), and red-necked phalaropes (Phalaropus lobatus), 5 foraging niches and 3 species of interest for analysis. We used non-metric multidimensiona​l scaling ordinations to assess seasonal shifts in the seabird community at a focal species and foraging group level. Both ordinations depicted strong seasonal gradients with distinct seasonal communities. Focal species were also driven by a distance to shore gradient, while foraging niches were more influenced by foraging type (diving versus surface feeding). The shoreward shift or outward dispersal of species appears driven by a combination of factors, including the diffusion of nearshore concentration of murres and cormorants on Yaquina Head post chick fledging, and the inshore movement of migratory species with the onset of upwelling and greater prey abundance. We employed generalized additive mixed models for the focal species, and tested for correlations with in situ data (salinity, temperature and fluorescence), depth, substrate, season, and a random ‘site’ effect. We identified correlations between several species and measured oceanographic variables, which indicated species’ selection of specific water masses. With Inverse Distance Weighted maps we detected high use zones by sooty shearwaters and common murres outside of both site boundaries, except during the spring and summer, when murres occur densely within the NETS. None of our observed species of concern (brown pelicans (Pelicanus occidentalis), black footed albatrosses (Phoebastria nigiripes) and marbled murrelets, (Brachyramphus marmoratus)) were detected within either site boundary. Rather, pelicans and murrelets were observed inshore of the SETS and south of the NETS, and albatrosses were all detected west of the sites. We observed overall low abundance of focal species within the sites, relative to adjacent areas, although the whole study area appears to be productive foraging habitat used by many species. As a baseline characterizatio​n of the seabird community off Newport, this work can help inform citing and permitting processes of similar wave energy test facilities and provide a platform for continued monitoring of seabirds in the area.","Porquez, Jessica M.",ORESU-Y-16-001,ORESU-Y-16-001,R/NIS-23-PD,theses/disserta​tions,2016,Oregon Sea Grant,"Spatiotemporal Drivers of Seabird Distribution at the Pacific Marine Energy Center off Newport, Oregon","Master of Science, Marine Resource Management, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Deciding how new uses fit with existing ocean uses is complex, but there are some tools available to help decision-​-​‐makers. Generating energy from waves is an emerging ocean use and the human dimension effects require further study. In 2011, the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (NNMREC), in conjunction with Oregon Sea Grant (OSG), began efforts to identify a site for a grid-​-​‐connected, open--‐ocean test facility for full--‐scale wave energy devices. The NNMREC and OSG led a siting process that included meetings with community leaders, public workshops, and the creation of teams of community members to develop siting proposals. This thesis research emerged from a solicitation for an independent evaluation of the siting process. The overall goal of this research was to determine if the siting process was effective. Specifically, using a mixed methods research approach consisting of semi-structured interviews and an online questionnaire, this research answered if participants: (a) where participants involved in the process at the level they wanted to be, (b) did participants understand the process, (c) did participants feel as though they were heard, and (d) did participants feel they had an influence on the outcome of the process? The goal of evaluating this siting process was to provide lessons that can inform future marine renewable energy siting efforts. Logistically, there were several successful aspects of the siting process. Most participants reported they had at least a fair understanding of the process and felt they had enough information. The most frequently used sources of information about the process came from public meetings and personal communications with process leaders. On average, participants reported they wished they had been more involved in the process, but most participants reported that this less-​than-​desired involvement was due to personal or professional constraints, not the process itself. On average, respondents understood the process and felt heard, but they neither agreed nor disagreed they had an influence on the process. As existing and new uses compete for space in the ocean, more social science research is needed to understand how best to choose sites for new uses. Research about stakeholder engagement in the process of siting marine renewable energy facilities is an emerging field of study, and gaining a better understanding of how to design and implement processes that effectively engage communities in wave energy siting could lead to more successful siting efforts in the future.","Goodwin, Briana",ORESU-Y-15-013,ORESU-Y-15-013,A/ESG-07,theses/disserta​tions,2015,Oregon Sea Grant,Evaluating community engagement in wave energy siting off the Oregon Coast,"Master of Science, Marine Resource Management, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Natural resource researchers ideally participate in broader impacts activities to extend the reach of their best available research. However, there are many cultural, institutional, and practical barriers to participating in broader impact activities and to incorporating science into natural resource use decisions. Researcher-​stakeholder engagement is one proposed solution to overcome such barriers and to achieve both broader impact and science-based policy goals. This research explores the research-​stakeholder engagement process as a means to achieve those ends. The objective of this study was to document the perceptions of participants in a transdisciplina​ry researcher-​stakeholder engagement process in order to identify its impacts as well as barriers and pathways to its successes. Literature has documented many researcher-​stakeholder engagement process case studies where researchers offer lessons learned and speculate on their impacts, but few offer data on the engagement process structure, the stakeholder perspective of the engagement process, or the impacts of collaboration between academic research teams and scientific stakeholders. This work addresses these gaps by taking a closer look at how one team of researchers engaged with its stakeholders and voicing the perceptions of stakeholders in addition to researchers.

The results presented here were intended to be representative of motivations, expectations, challenges, successes, and outcomes salient to all WW2100 participants.

Marine resource managers are encouraged to recognize that marine space use is dynamic and multidimensiona​l and as such research thereof requires a balance between the efficiency of GIS and the stories captured and told by ethnographic research. There are important linkages within and across fisheries and other uses, communities and interests, and across the landesea interface. Therefore, it is important to use techniques demonstrated in this research that (1) integrate ethnographic and geospatial data collection and analysis; (2) engage stakeholders throughout the process; and (3) recognize the unique qualities of each geographic location and user group to support sound decision-​making.","Sullivan, Colleen M.;Conway, Flaxen;Pomeroy, Carrie;Hall-Arber, Madeleine;Wright Dawn J.",MIT-R-15-001,MITSG 16-40,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),2015,MIT Sea Grant,Combining GIS and Ethnography to Better Understand and Plan Ocean Space Use,NA,http://ir.libra​ry.oregonstate.​edu/xmlui/bitst​ream/handle/195​7/54821/Sulliva​nColleenCEOASCo​mbiningGeograph​icInformation.p​df?sequence=4 (Oregon State University Open Access Articles),"Applied Geography, 59:70-77, 2015",NA,10.1016/j.apgeo​g.2014.11.027,Elsevier,NA

The goals of this paper are to investigate (1) how the varying decisn time impacts the mortality rate, (2) how the choice of different modes of transportation (i.e., walking and automobile), and (3) how existence of vertical evacuation gates impacts the estimation of casualties. Using the city of Seaside, Oregon as a case study site, different individual decision-making time scales are included in the model to assess the mortality rate due to immediate evacuation right after initial earthquake or after a specified milling time. The results show that (1) the decision-making time (s) and the variations in decision time (r) are strongly correlated with the mortality rate; (2) the provision of vertical evacuation structures is effective to reduce the mortality rate; (3) the mortality rate is sensitive to the variations in walking speed of the evacuee population; and (4) the higher percentage of automobile use in tsunami evacuation, the higher the mortality rate. Following the results, this paper concludes with a description of the challenges ahead in agent-based tsunami evacuation modeling and simulation, and the modeling of complex interactions between agents (i.e., pedestrian and car interactions) that would arise for a multi-hazard scenario for the Cascadia Subduction Zone.","Wang, Haizhong;Mostafizi, Alireza;Cramer, Lori A.;Cox, Dan;Park, Hyoungsu",ORESU-R-16-002,ORESU-R-16-002,R/CNH-26,reprints (peer-reviewed),2016,Oregon Sea Grant,An agent-based model of a multimodal near-field tsunami evacuation: Decision-making and life safety,NA,NA,"Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 64:86-100, March 2016",NA,10.1016/j.trc.2​015.11.010,Elsevier,NA

In the Pacific Northwest, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami from the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) represents one of the most pressing natural disasters with an astonishing high 7%-12% chance of occurrence by 2060. The destructive nature of earthquakes and the subsequent near-field tsunami, and also the retrofitting challenges of infrastructure network motivates us to accurately model the tsunami evacuation to reduce the number of fatalities. This thesis presents an agent-based multi-modal near-field tsunami evacuation modeling framework in Netlogo. The goals of this study are two folded. The first objective is to investigate how (1) decision time, (2) choice of modes of transportation (i.e., walking and automobile), and in general (3) different variables involved in the evacuation scenario (e.g., walking speed and driving speed) impact the estimation of casualties. Using the city of Seaside, Oregon as a study site, which is one of the most vulnerable cities on the Oregon coast, different evacuation scenarios are included in the model to assess the impact of parameters involved on the mortality rate of the tsunami event. The results show that (1) evacuation mode choice strongly influences the expected number of casualties; (2) the mortality rate is strongly correlated with decision-making time (τ ); and (3) the mortality rate is sensitive to the variations in walking speed of the evacuee population. Secondly, this study extends the agent-based modeling framework to assess the transportation network vulnerability in Seaside, OR, under unplanned disruptions (i.e., bridge failures) due to the Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake initiating a near-field tsunami on the coast of State of Oregon. The criticality of each link in the entire network is evaluated iteratively by connecting the impacts of link failures on the resultant mortality rate. After assessing all the links, an innovative method is developed to identify the most critical links within the network. Further assessment is conducted on the identified critical links to formulate an optimal network retrofitting plan to minimize the mortality rate considering the limited amount of resources. The framework has been tested on the transportation network of city of Seaside, OR, and the results show that the critical links are not necessarily the bridges in the network. Therefore, the identification of the critical links requires a systematic assessment of the entire transportation network, and furthermore, minimizing the mortality rate necessitates the logical use of available resources.","Mostafizi, Alireza",ORESU-Y-16-004,ORESU-Y-16-004,R/CNH-26,theses/disserta​tions,2016,Oregon Sea Grant,Agent-based tsunami evacuation model: Life safety and network resilience,"Master of Science, Civil Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I analyzed eight federal statutes and eight Oregon state statutes all relating to ocean and coastal law. After analyzing each statute, I determined that each statute has an element of ecosystem-based management and that none of the statutes fully implement ecosystem-based management. The strength of ecosystem-based management is that, if fully implemented, the approach has the potential to protect large marine ecosystems. Its weakness is that creating the perfect statute that includes all elements is nearly impossible due to differing politics, opinions, and perspectives.

One oft-cited option is to increase the biomass of photosynthetic organisms to remove CO2 from the water column and facilitate organic carbon burial. Seagrasses show much promise in this regard, owing to their highly refractive tissue. Timescales of carbon burial with respect to this strategy are on the order of years to decades. Recent studies, however, demonstrate that some marine bivalves experience short windows of heightened sensitivity to OA, especially during the early larval and early postmetamorphic “juvenile” stages, which occur on timescales of hours to days. In coastal areas, carbonate chemistry is highly variable on similar timescales, due in part to photosynthetic cycles, the pattern and magnitude of which will vary due to the ecological make-up of the habitat. Therefore, we must consider the highly complex and variable nature of CO2 dynamics in seagrass habitats on short timescales when we consider their potential role in OA mitigation. We examined patterns of growth and survival in the juvenile Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas) outplanted within and outside beds of two different species of seagrass, the native Zostera marina and the non-native Z. japonica, in Netarts Bay, Oregon. Z. marina and Z. japonica differ in the timing and magnitude of their growth and decay cycles and allocation of biomass above or below ground. Z. marina increased both growth and survival of C. gigas spat with the magnitude of the effects decreasing after mid-​season as seagrass growth slows and there is a transition to an upwelling-​dominant hydrodynamic regime. Z. japonica appeared to have a slightly negative, but not statistically significant, effect on juvenile C. gigas growth, compared to the associated bare-sand control site, with the notable exception of a reversal of the trend in June, co-incident with this seagrass’s short period of growth. We have compared bivalve success metrics (growth and survival) with PCO2 measurements within each habitat. Patterns in bivalve success metrics appear to inversely correlate with trends in daily CO2 minima over the course of the season, suggesting that bivalve success may be attributed to compensatory growth during daily low- CO2 periods associated with the seagrass’s respective growing seasons.","Smith, Stephanie Rae",ORESU-Y-16-005,ORESU-Y-16-005,R/ECO-27,theses/disserta​tions,2016,Oregon Sea Grant,Seagrasses as potential chemical refugia for acidification-​sensitive bivalves,"Master of Science, Marine Resource Management, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study explores the participation, motivations, and expectations of research team members and stakeholders in the WW2100 researcher-​stakeholder engagement process. Twenty-six semi-structured interviews of key participants and 137 completed online questionnaires illuminate their perceptions of the engagement process. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that participants are motivated to attend for social (ex. knowing other participants), knowledge (ex. interest in the topic), and utility (ex. useful management tool) reasons. Nonparametric statistical analyses show that research team members and stakeholders had similar expectations for the roles participants would play but different expectations for the process and resulting model. For instance, all participants expected research team members to interpret model outputs and stakeholders to provide a “boots on the ground” perspective but only researchers expected the process to provide career experience.

Their video analysis, however, is typically based on visual inspection. This incurs prohibitively large user costs, and severely limits the scope of biological studies. There is a need for developing vision algorithms that can address specific needs of marine biologists, such as fine-grained categorization of fish motion patterns. This is a difficult problem, because of very small inter-class and large intra-class differences between fish motion patterns. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we apply our new fish detector to identify and localize fish occurrences in each frame, under partial occlusion, and amidst dynamic texture patterns formed by whirls of sand on the sea bed. Then, we conduct tracking-​by-​detection. Given the similarity between fish detections, defined in terms of fish appearance and motion properties, we formulate fish tracking as transitively linking similar detections between every two consecutive frames, so as to maintain their unique track IDs. Finally, we extract histograms of fish displacements along the estimated tracks. The histograms are classified by the Random Forest technique to recognize distinct classes of fish motion patterns. Evaluation on challenging underwater videos demonstrates that our approach outperforms the state-​of-​the-​art techniques. This paper presents an approach to video categorization aimed at facilitating a particular marine biology study.

In the marine environment, estimates of connectivity often rely on the use of genetic markers, as dispersal primarily occurs during a planktonic larval phase which is difficult to track using direct methods. In this thesis, we investigated the population genetic structure of the most valuable commercially harvested species on the west coast of the United States, the Dungeness crab (Cancer magister). We utilized both population- and individual-​based genetic analyses to establish baseline knowledge of genetic connectivity of Dungeness crab throughout ~1,200 km of the California Current System (CCS) in 2012, and tested for inter-annual variability in our estimates by sampling again in 2014. In 2012, we observed a pattern of isolation by distance despite there being little genetic population structure throughout our study range. In addition, several sites had significant evidence of kin aggregation, which was correlated with genetic differentiation as measured by pairwise FST. In 2014, pairwise FST estimates were noticeably lower, there was no spatial autocorrelation​, and fewer sights had significant evidence of kin aggregation. We attributed these findings to increased migrant exchange during potential larval dispersal years, which was mediated by variation in physical oceanographic conditions (i.e. Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase, timing of the spring transition, amount of upwelling during the spring and summer). Dispersal trajectory, and thus gene flow, is likely influenced by variation in physical oceanographic conditions, thereby affecting genetic population structure. Estimates of effective population size (NE) indicated that NE was large in both 2012 and 2014, but we were unable to discern any change between years. Together, these findings suggest that Dungeness crab in the CCS may constitute a single evolutionary population, though geographically limited dispersal results in isolation by distance. We also evaluated genetic connectivity among Dungeness crab inhabiting a partially enclosed water body, Puget Sound, in comparison to those residing in the coastal ocean. With the exception of Hood Canal, we observed genetic homogeneity within both Puget Sound and coastal Washington. Genetic differentiation between Puget Sound and coastal Washington was variable among sites, therefore genetic connectivity is stronger within either area than between them. Overall, our results suggest that Dungeness crab exemplify characteristics of a ‘high gene flow’ species, despite evidence supporting geographically limited gene flow. Our findings did not indicate that altering the management strategy to reflect discrete genetic subunits or conversation needs (i.e. low genetic diversity) is necessary at this time. In addition, our findings highlight the need for future research to investigate demographic processes that influence gene flow (i.e. dispersal trajectory).","Jackson, Tyler M.",ORESU-Y-16-006,ORESU-Y-16-006,R/RCF-33,theses/disserta​tions,2016,Oregon Sea Grant,Genetic Connectivity of Dungeness Crab (Cancer magister) in the California Current System and Puget Sound,"Master of Science, Fisheries Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/17763096_2369_2815383.csv,173,"Marine mammals are top predators that are essential for the health and function of our oceans. These top predators are often affected by various factors that can be detrimental to their populations. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate undetermined causes of deaths and to better understand known diseases in marine mammals to mitigate future marine mammal mortality events. In this dissertation, I examined a mortality event that occurred in 2009 and affected seven harbor seals that died from an unknown brain disease. In 2009, a cohort of harbor seals stranded along the California coastline and the necropsies of these animals showed necrosis in the cerebrum and cerebellum. However, the etiology of the disease could not be determined with conventional diagnostic procedures. The results from the necropsy reports suggested that a virus was the likely causative agent, although it was also noted that exposure to a toxin, nutrient depletion, or hypoxia could have also caused the death of these animals. To investigate the source of this stranding event I compared the brain tissues of these harbor seals, that I termed “unknown cause of death” (UCD), to the brain tissues of seven other harbor seals with known causes of death that I termed “comparative” samples. Given that UCD animals were hypothesized to have died from an unknown virus type, I used meta-​transcriptomics analysis of the brains to assess the presence of gene expression patterns from DNA/RNA viruses and opportunistic bacteria. Upon evaluation of the UCD animals, I found that there was no indication that viruses were present in the brain tissue of these animals. However, I did find the presence of a previously described Phocine herpesvirus-1 (PhV- 1) in 57% of comparative harbor seal samples. Interestingly, the microbiome analysis of the UCD animals showed two significantly abundant bacteria types, Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Coxiella burnetii. BCC was prevalent in all UCDs, which expressed a significant abundance of BCC virulence factors relative to comparative samples. Furthermore, only one UCD animal had a high abundance of C. burnetii, which represented ~94% of the microbiome community and showed a high abundance of transcripts for invasion and translation, suggesting that this was an active pathogen infection. From this evidence, I conclude that viruses were not the cause of death of UCD animals and that BCC and C. burnetii were potential opportunistic neurotropic infections in UCD animals. While our meta-​transcriptomic analysis showed interesting trends in the microbiome of UCD animals, the cause of death for UCDs remained undetermined. To further evaluate the death of these animals, I applied a transcriptomics analysis to evaluate the effects of this event on host gene expression. I compared UCD transcriptomes to only those harbor seals with a PhV-1 infection. Analysis of the host transcriptome showed that while PhV-1 infected seals had gene repertoires of animals undergoing a virus infection, UCD animals did not. UCD animals did, however, demonstrate a significantly high gene expression pattern associated with fatty acid metabolic pathways. Interestingly, fatty acid dysregulation is associated with nutrient depletion and exposure to toxins, thus I speculate that UCD animals died from these factors, and led to a high expression of fatty acid metabolism genes in the brain. Along with characterizing the transcriptome of UCD samples, I also characterized the harbor seal-virus response during a PhV-1 infection. The transcriptome results showed that all animals undergoing a PhV-1 infection were mounting both innate and adaptive immune system responses. Also, the gene expression patterns I uncovered suggests that PhV-1 hijacks the host DNA packaging and exocytosis pathways for viral replication. Lastly, to evaluate the genome and the gene expression patterns of PhV-1 during infection in the brain, I first used metagenomics to sequence and characterize the unique long (UL) and unique short (US) regions of the PhV-1 genome. I then used transcriptomics to identify the gene expression of PhV-1. In this study, we described 72 genes in PhV-1, the majority which have never been described in this virus. In all four seals, the gene expression pattern showed similar patterns of active regions across the genome, which may be important for the late phases on infection in the brain. Overall this work has applied a combination of ‘-omics’ analyses to understand an unknown disease in harbor seals and further characterized the host-virus response of a known marine mammal pathogen.","Rosales, Stephanie",ORESU-Y-16-007,ORESU-Y-16-007,R/BT-51-PD,theses/disserta​tions,2016,Oregon Sea Grant,The Use of Omics for Disease Evaluation in the Brains of Marine Mammals,"Doctor of Philosophy, Microbiology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The major prey items ingested were copepods, cladocerans and gelatinous taxa, and comprised 4–77% of gut contents. Northern anchovy eggs (Engraulis mordax) were a dominantprey item at stations near the Columbia River, comprising 40% of gut contents. Prey selection indices showed thatthough copepods dominated gut contents, C. fuscescens preferentially ingested slow-moving, non-motile prey includingfish eggs and gelatinous taxa and negatively selected for more motile prey such as copepods. Clearance ratesand ingestion rates varied by three orders of magnitude for the different zooplankton taxa but, on average, fish eggsand gelatinous taxa were cleared at higher rates than more commonly ingested prey items such as copepods.

Tracking data provide unparalleled information on the distribution of marine taxa, but there are no agreed guidelines that ensure these data are used consistently to identify biodiversity hotspots and inform marine management decisions. Here, we develop methods to standardize the analysis of tracking data to identify sites of conservation importance at global and regional scales. We applied these methods to the largest available compilation of seabird tracking data, covering 60 species, collected from 55 deployment locations ranging from the poles to the tropics. Key developments include a test for pseudo-​replication to assess the independence of two groups of tracking data, an objective approach to define species-​specific smoothing parameters (h values) for kernel density estimation basedon area-restricted search behaviour, and an analysis to determine whether sites identified from tracked individuals are also representative for the wider population. This analysis delineated priority sites for marine conservation for 52 of the 60 species assessed. We compiled 252 data groupings and defined 1052 polygons, between them meeting Important Bird and Biodiversity Area criteriaover 1500 times. Other results showed 13% of data groups were inadequate forsite definition and 10% showed some level of pseudo-​replication. Between 25 and 50 trips were needed within a data group for data to be considered at least partially representative of the respective population.

Large movement datasets are increasingly common and there is a need for efficient methods of data exploration that adjust to the individual variability of each track. We present the Residence in Space and Time (RST) method to classify behavior patterns in movement data based on the concept that behavior states can be partitioned by the amount of space and time occupied in an area of constant scale. Using normalized values of Residence Timeand Residence Distance within a constant search radius, RST is able to differentiate behavior patterns that are time-intensive (e.g., rest), time & distance-​intensive (e.g., area restricted search), and transit (short time and distance). We use grey-headed albatross(Thala​ssarche chrysostoma) GPS tracks to demonstrate RST's ability to classify behavior patterns and adjust to the inherent scale and individuality of each track. Next, we evaluate RST's ability to discriminate between behavior states relative to other classical movement metrics. We then temporally sub-sample albatross track data to illustrate RST's response to less resolved data. Finally, we evaluate RST's performance using datasets from four taxa with diverse ecology, functional scales, ecosystems, and data-types. We conclude that RST is a robust, rapid, and flexible method for detailed exploratory analysis and meta-analyses of behavioral states in animal movement data based on its ability to integrate distance and time measurements into one descriptive metric of behavior groupings. Given the increasing amount of animal movement data collected, it is timely and useful to implement a consistent metric of behavior classification to enable efficient and comparative analyses.

Re- sults show that all methods perform uniformly in terms of correcting statistical moments for individual variables with the exception of a copula based method underperforming for wave period. When compar- ing parametric and empirical methods, no difference is found. Between bivariate and univariate methods, results show that bivariate methods greatly improve inter-variable correlations. Of the bivariate methods tested the copula based method is found to be not as effective at correcting correlation while a “shuf- fling”method is unable to handle changes in correlation from historic to future periods.

In 2012, 576 farms in Oregon provided agritourism and recreational services.3 With more than 35,000 farms statewide, there is ample room for growth in this area. Understanding the permits required to establish an agritourism enterprise is a crucial first step toward incorporating this type of activity into your existing operation. The state of Oregon’s land use system provides a framework for regulating agritourism in the state.

Seacast is made and maintained in conjunction by the Senior Design teams from OSU’s Department of Computer Science and OSU’s Department of Marine Resources Management of the College of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. This year’s team from the Senior Design class added new features including showing tides on the site, producing a wind model, and fixed a major bug where Seacast would crash itself if a single model was missing. This document contains information on the yearlong process done by the 2016 Seacast team including documentation, requirements, and reflections. Seacast(Secast.​org) is a website that shows visualization of ocean forecasting off of the Oregon Coast and is designed for ease of use and simplicity. The project was first conceptualized by a Grad Student at the College of Earth, Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences, Duncan, after he discovered that Newport Fisherman had been using another ocean forecast site (nvs.nanoos.org​), but desired something simpler. With the help of Ted Strub and Flaxen Conway from the Marine Resource Management department of the COEAS the project was pitched to the Computer Science Senior Design Class. This team, who authored this document, is the third team to have worked on the project and consists of Miles Curry, Anthony Dunaway, and Will Olsen. There are a lot of other proprietary and forecasting applications available for commercial fisherman, but Seacast looks to serve models that are not normally available to fisherman for free. Seacast uses models that are produced here at Oregon State University including a local ROM’s model and OSU WW3. The clients for this project included Conway, and Strub. There were also others who helped with the development during this term including Craig Risien and Jessica Kuonen. Conway’s and Strub’s role in this project was primarily a supervisory role. They helped with figuring out and designing requirements and discovering fisherman needs and the overall site direction. As a supporter Risien helped with development by providing examples and information on producing plots and Kuonen help facilitate handling fisherman response. Seacast uses Django, a Python web framework, in combination with MatPlotLib, Numpy, Scipy and other python modules to produce high-quality forecast visualizations.

Members of both the enforcement and commercial trawl fishing communities speculate and complain about regulatory compliance, often from opposite perspectives. A small research project in Oregon studied the relationship between these communities and regulation compliance. Although a difference was noted in the relationships between the varied levels of enforcement and trawl fishermen, this did not constitute a shift in compliance; compliance remained high with participants from both communities reporting that the fishermen have “little choice but to follow the rules.” What varied was communication within and between these communities, and the amount of control participants’ felt they had in regulation development.

For species that inhabit both the coastal ocean and partially enclosed water bodies (i.e., estuaries or fjords), this information is even more critical since estuaries and fjords are often characterized by hydrological complexities which can limit dispersal potential and promote population subdivision. In this study, genetic connectivity of Dungeness crab Cancer magister in Puget Sound and coastal Washington, USA, was examined to test the hypothesis of genetic structure in partially enclosed versus open environments. Dungeness crab that were sampled at five sites in Puget Sound in 2015 and three sites in coastal Washington in 2014 were genotyped at ten microsatellite loci. We observed similar levels of heterozygosity and allelic richness within Puget Sound and coastal Washington. Pairwise FST estimates indicated that Hood Canal was significantly differentiated from other Puget Sound sites, except Nisqually, suggesting larval retention within the Hood Canal basin. No evidence for significant genetic differentiation was found among the four remaining Puget Sound sites or among the three coastal sites. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that, in aggregate, Puget Sound sites significantly differed from coastal sites. On a site by site basis, we found evidence for significant differentiation between three sites in Puget Sound and coastal Washington. Based upon the observed patterns of genetic differentiation​, our findings did not support our hypothesis of restricted genetic connectivity within Puget Sound, with the exception of Hood Canal. However, our results demonstrate that there is stronger genetic connectivity within Puget Sound and coastal Washington than between these two areas.","Jackson, Tyler M.;O'Malley, Kathleen G.",ORESU-R-17-009,ORESU-R-17-009,R/RCF-33,reprints (peer-reviewed),2017,Oregon Sea Grant,Comparing genetic connectivity among Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) inhabiting Puget Sound and coastal Washington,NA,NA,"Marine Biology, 164:123, pp. 1-12, Published online doi: 10.1007/s00227-​017-​3152-​7, May 4, 2017",NA,10.1007/s00227-​017-​3152-​7,NA,NA

Limited attention has been paid to the effects of pharmaceuticals on marine life, despite widespread detection of these contaminants in the marine environment. Of the existing studies, the majority assess the negative effects of pharmaceuticals over an exposure period of 30 days or less and focus on cellular and subcellular biomarkers. Longer studies are required to determine if chronic contaminant exposure poses risks to marine life at environmentally relevant concentrations.​ Also scarce in the literature is examination of whole organism effects to identify potential community-level consequences. Two long-term studies with the antidepressant pharmaceutical, fluoxetine (the active constituent in Prozac®) were conducted to determine whether nominal concentrations detected in estuarine and coastal environments affect organism health and interactions. First, we measured whole organism metrics in the California mussel, Mytilus californianus over a period of 107 days. Specifically, we measured algal clearance rates, growth, and condition indices for both reproductive and overall health. We found that fluoxetine negatively affects all measured characteristics​, however many effects are mediated by length of exposure. Perhaps the most notable result was that mussels spiked with fluoxetine cleared less algae after 30 days of exposure. Reduced growth and condition indices likely are a consequence of improper nutrition among fluoxetine-​treated mussels. Any level of fluoxetine significantly affected the gonadosomatic index after 47 days. The results from this study on mussels fill an important data gap, highlighting organism-​level effects of chronic exposure periods; such data more explicitly identify the impacts of pharmaceuticals and other contaminants on marine communities and ecosystems. Fluoxetine has been documented to affect the behavior of fish and invertebrates, ​ including freshwater and marine bivalves, crustaceans (i.e., crayfish and crabs), and fish. Given that other crustaceans exhibited increased activity levels under fluoxetine exposure, we hypothesized that this would subject them to greater predation risk. In our second exposure study, we assessed whether a similar range of fluoxetine concentrations ​ used in the mussel study altered the risk behavior of the Oregon mud crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis, in response to a common predator, the red rock crab, Cancer productus. We conducted this study for 60 days, conducting day and night behavioral trials (with and without predators) four times a week. We found that crabs exposed to any amount of fluoxetine (3 or 30ng/L) had increased activity levels relative to controls; however behaviors of 3ng/L-spiked crabs were not always significantly different from controls. Among control crabs, day and night trials yielded similar results, where a clear response to the addition of the predator was observed. Crabs dosed with fluoxetine exhibited more foraging and active behaviors in the presence of the predator. Additionally, crabs spiked with fluoxetine at 30 ng/L had the greatest risk of mortality either by predation by red rock crabs or due to more aggressive behaviors among conspecifics. The results of this study shed light on a particularly unexplored area of contaminants research: how do psychoactive pharmaceuticals affect animal behavior when exposed to the low concentrations persisting in the aquatic environment for a prolonged period of time?","Peters, Joseph",ORESU-Y-16-010,ORESU-Y-16-010,E/INT-145;E/A-16,theses/disserta​tions,2016,Oregon Sea Grant,Pharmaceutical contaminants as stressors on rocky intertidal and estuarine organisms: A case study of fluoxetine,Master of Science,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both species of shrimp are considered ecosystem engineers as they bioturbate and irrigate extensive galleries within the sediment. While their burrows comprise a dominant habitat type in west coast estuaries, little is known about these shrimps’ diet and their role in estuarine food webs. The primary goals of this study were to identify major components of burrowing shrimp diets and detect variation in these diets along an estuarine gradient using combined fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope (SI) analyses. Shrimp and potential food sources including eelgrass blades, epiphytes, Ulva, sedimentary particulate organic matter (SPOM), burrow walls, and particulate organic material (POM) were sampled at different locations within Yaquina Bay, Oregon in August 2012. Both SI and FA analyses indicated differences in food resources assimilated by shrimp along the estuarine gradient. SI values showed that diets for U. pugettensis consisted of carbon sources derived primarily from POM and SPOM, while POM and epiphytes were primary carbon sources for N. californiensis. Shrimp from lower estuarine sites had high levels of 16:1ω7 and 20:5ω3 FAs suggesting their diet is enriched with marine diatoms. Shrimp from upriver showed greater proportion of FA associated with dinoflagellates and terrestrial sources as indicated by a high percentage of C18 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs).

Today, the RISA program funds 11 projects throughout the United States. The mission of connecting science to society is also embodied in the Cooperative Extension System established at Land Grant Universities across the United States over a century ago to produce usable science to support agricultural and resource management activities. Since then, Extension has pioneered and developed a rich history of bridging the gap between research from universities and the needs of practitioners such as agricultural producers, forest landowners, and resource managers. The success of this institutional approach led to the creation of Sea Grant colleges and extension professionals focused initially on supporting fisheries management with cutting edge science. This mission has grown to cover additional areas of need including coastal hazards planning and climate change adaptation.

The Center does not require an admission fee and provides an experience that is unique on the Oregon coast. Thirty-nine percent of visitors surveyed indicated that half or more of their reason for coming to the Oregon coast was to visit the Visitor Center. The percentage of visitors citing the Visitor Center as their reason for travelling to Lincoln County was the same.

The importance of this industry to human communities is often neglected in fisheries research, with economic and ecological data being favored by managers and decision makers. Recent observations in many coastal communities have indicated aging of fishermen and a lack of young people entering the industry, causing a ""graying effect"" in commercial fishing fleets. This phenomenon could have significant implications for commercial fishing participants as well as the larger communities this industry supports. This qualitative study uses oral history data to examine the graying phenomenon and implications for the resilience of the commercial fishing industry in two coastal communities in Oregon. Extensive research has been conducted on the graying of the fleet in Alaska but research on the phenomenon in the Pacific Northwest is lacking. Results reveal that commercial fishermen, fishing family members, and fishing support industry representatives perceive graying as a threat. This threat was specifically referenced in relation to changing fisheries management such as catch share implementation, as well as shifting motivations to fish and dynamic social influences. Such changes may impact resilience through lost local ecological knowledge, diminished connection to place, and a loss of financial capital that has historically been brought into coastal communities through commercial fishing. This research offers insight into the relationship between fisheries management and community perception, and provides potential strategies that can be used to combat current regulations favoring larger corporate fishing enterprises. The results of this study also add to the literature on the graying of the fleet phenomenon providing much needed background and context for more extensive graying projects into the future.","Caracciolo, Deanna E.",ORESU-Y-17-001,ORESU-Y-17-001,R/RCF-36,theses/disserta​tions,2017,Oregon Sea Grant,Youth Recruitment and an Aging Workforce: A Pilot Study of Intergeneration​al Family Business in Oregon’s Commercial Fishing Industry,Masters of Science thesis,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Oregon State University Libraries, Scholars Archives @ OSU",NA

Oregon fishing communities show interest in developing a percebes market utilizing Pollicipes polymerus. This research aims to inform resource managers to avoid over harvesting Oregon goosenecks. In summer 2016, researchers investigated the current status of P. polymerus populations with three primary objectives:A. Describe Oregon gooseneck populations on coastal jetties to inform harvest management. B. Explore possible mariculture development for onshore gooseneck production. C. Establish a collaborative multistakeholde​r framework for sustainable fishery development. Researchers surveyed eight southern Oregon jetties using transect sampling and photographic documentation of gooseneck populations, which were then characterized by size-frequency distribution and density. Researchers observed spatially explicit trends according to tidal height and large variability in populations between jetties. Only 2% of these are of harvest-size, providing an Oregon percebes stock of up to 235,000 kg. Surveys suggest that wild populations of P. polymerus are unlikely to sustain long-term commercial harvest should the market significantly expand beyond its current size without implementing adaptive management practices. Affordable mariculture should be established to avoid overharvest in a growing market. Researchers designed a promising prototype for a relatively simple, affordable and effective onshore mariculture design to supplement commercial gooseneck production, with the ability to enhance barnacle growth rates using food supplementation​. Throughout the project, researchers maintained frequent communication with multiple stakeholders to focus the objectives and used public seminars to communicate findings and their implications to interested harvesters, managers, and the public. This research expands the knowledge base informing a viable, sustainable fishery.

Recent ecological, economic, and regulatory changes impacting fisheries are likely to have important consequences for this industry and the communities it supports. The objective of this study is to improve understanding of coastal community resilience through examination of the graying of the fleet phenomenon in two fishing communities in Oregon. This phenomenon has been studied extensively in Alaska, but little is known about this trend in the Pacific Northwest. This study uses qualitative research methods to examine the occurrence of the graying of the fleet in Oregon, factors contributing to this phenomenon, and implications for the resilience of fishing communities. Findings indicate that community leaders do not perceive graying of the fleet as an issue of local concern. However, regulatory changes in the fishing industry that have contributed to changes in the structure of local fleets may obscure the full spectrum of social and economic consequences resulting from fisheries management decisions. Such changes may have negative implications for resilience should they diminish the amount of financial, cultural, and human capital in these communities. Greater understanding of the relationship between fisheries management policies and community resilience will enable those in fisheries management and policymaking arenas to make more informed choices that fully account for the broad range of consequences stemming from their decisions. This research will also help communities develop effective strategies to enhance resilience in the face of ongoing change.","Flathers, Courtney L.",ORESU-Y-17-002,ORESU-Y-17-002,R/RCF-36,theses/disserta​tions,2017,Oregon Sea Grant,Continuity & Change: Commercial Fishing & Community Resilience on the Oregon Coast,MPP Essay,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is a surprising absence of data, however, on how cell shape affects grazing, which is crucial for predicting the fate of oceanic carbon. We used synthetic spherical and prolate spheroid microbeads to isolate the effect of particle length-to-width ratios on grazing and fate in the ocean. Here we show that the shape of microbe-sized particles affects predation by the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, a globally abundant marine grazer. Using incubation experiments, we demonstrate that shape affects how particles are retained in the house and that the minimum particle diameter is the key variable determining how particles are ingested. High-speed videography revealed the mechanism behind these results: microbe-sized spheroids oriented with the long axis parallel to fluid streamlines, matching the speed and tortuosity of spheres of equivalent width. Our results suggest that the minimum particle diameter determines how elongated prey interact with the feeding-filters of appendicularian​s, which may help to explain the prevalence of ellipsoidal cells in the ocean, since a cell’s increased surface-​to-​volume ratio does not always increase predation. We provide the first evidence that grazing by appendicularian​s can cause non-uniform export of different shaped particles, thereby influencing particle fate.","Conley, Keats R;Sutherland, Kelly R.",ORESU-R-17-012,ORESU-R-17-012,E/INT-129,reprints (peer-reviewed),2017,Oregon Sea Grant,Particle shape impacts export and fate in the ocean through interactions with the globally abundant appendicularian Oikopleura dioica,OPEN ACCESS,NA,"PLoS ONE, 12(8):e0183105, August 30, 2017",NA,10.1371/journal​.pone.0183105,PLOS-ONE,NA

Building on these and other efforts, a group of Oregon State University researchers and students, outreach specialists, and coastal community members in Tillamook County, Oregon (OR), are assessing climate change impacts and associated community and ecosystem vulnerability. Through sustained engagement with the Tillamook County Coastal Futures Knowledge to Action Network (TCCF KTAN), we co-developed a suite of alternative scenarios for exploring adaptation strategies for reducing vulnerability to coastal hazards based on a variety of drivers of change. These alternative scenarios were explored using Envision, a spatially explicit multi-agent modeling platform supporting scenario-based planning to examine interactions between the coupled human and natural coastal system. At its foundation is the identification of key stakeholder desires and outcomes for the future of the coastal shore (e.g., access to the beach, resilient infrastructure, etc.). These self-expressed outcomes are the orienting principle of this KTAN driven process. Probabilistic simulations of extreme total water levels, long-term coastal change, and storm-induced dune erosion along the shoreline allowed us to represent the variable impacts of SLR, wave climate, and the El Niño Southern Oscillation in a range of climate change scenarios through the end of the century. Additionally, we explored a range of alternative futures related to policy decisions and socioeconomic trends using input from KTAN participants. We quantified the impact of both policy scenarios and climate change scenarios on a range of participant defined metrics. In some scenarios, model results suggest severe reductions in beach accessibility (one metric highly valued by the TCCF KTAN) by the 3 end of century, due to the cumulative placement of riprap backshore protection structures. Flooding and erosion to coastal buildings and infrastructure also increases on a variety of scales depending on the types of policies implemented. In general, human decisions introduced greater variability and uncertainty to the impacts to the landscape by coastal hazards than climate change uncertainty. In other words, the Tillamook County Coastal Futures Project has helped to determine the relative impact of policy and management decisions on the adaptive capacity of Tillamook County, OR under a range of future climate scenarios. This white paper was written to document the TCCF project's process and outcomes and to serve as a resource for Tillamook County and other communities grappling with coastal development and climate change issues.","Ruggiero, Peter;Lipiec, Eva;Mills, Alexis;Bolte, John;Corcoran, Pat;Stevenson, John;Serafin, Katherine A.;Evans-​Wilent,Janan",ORESU-T-17-001,ORESU-T-17-001,A/EGS-07,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2017,Oregon Sea Grant,The Tillamook County Coastal Futures Project: Exploring alternative scenarios for Tillamook County’s coastline,Tillamook County Knowledge-​to-​Action Networks,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We collaborated with fishermen to assess the efficacy of applying BSL regulations from the demersal longline sablefish fishery in Alaska to a similar fishery along the U.S West Coast. In contrast to Alaska, some U.S. West Coast vessels use floats along the line to keep hooks off the seafloor, where scavengers degrade the bait and the target catch. Our results confirmed that BSL regulations from Alaska were sufficient to protect baits from bird attacks on longlines without floats, but not baits on longlines with floats. Longlines with floats sank below the reach of albatrosses (2 m depth) at a distance astern (157.7 m ± 44.8 95% CI) that was 2.3 times farther than longlines without floats (68.8 m ± 37.8 95% CI). The floated longline distance was well beyond the protection afforded by BSLs, which is approximately 40 m of aerial extent. Black-footed albatross attacked floated longlines at rates ten times more (2.7 attacks/1000 hooks, 0.48–4.45 95%CI) than longlines without floats (0.20 attacks/1000 hooks, 0.01–0.36 95% CI). Retrospective analysis of NOAA Fisheries Groundfish Observer Program data suggested that seabird bycatch occurs in a few sablefish longline fishing sectors and a minority of vessels, but is not confined to larger vessels. Analysis also confirmed fishermen testimonials that night setting reduced albatross bycatch by an order of magnitude compared to daytime setting, without reducing target catch. Night setting could be an effective albatross bycatch prevention practice if applied to the U.S. West Coast sablefish longline fishery and provide a practical alternative for vessels that elect to use floated longlines. These results highlight the importance of understanding region-specific longline gear modifications to identify effective bycatch reduction tools and the value of working collaboratively with fishermen to craft solutions.","Gladics, Amanda J.;Melvin, Edward F.;Suryan, Robert M.;Good, Thomas P.;Jannot, Jason E.;Guy, Troy J.",ORESU-R-17-011,ORESU-R-17-011,A/ESG-07,reprints (peer-reviewed),2017,Oregon Sea Grant,Fishery-​specific solutions to seabird bycatch in the U.S. West Coast sablefish fishery,Open Access;Same as: CASG-R-17-017,NA,"Fisheries Research, 196:85-95, 2017",NA,10.1016/j.fishr​​es.2017.08.015​,Elsevier,NA

To align physiology and behavior with prevailing environmental conditions, seasonal animals integrate cues from the environment with their internal state. One of the systems animals use to integrate those cues is the hypothalamus - pituitary - adrenal (HPA) axis and its primary effector, glucocorticoid hormo nes. The HPA axis has wide-ranging effects on physiology and behavior and, in the context of a glucocorticoid stress response, is known to mediate tradeoffs between immediate survival and future fitness. The HPA axis also plays an important role in facilit ating predictable life-history events. Variation in HPA axis activity has been reported in all vertebrates, often coordinating seasonal reproduction and possibly also transitions between life-history stages. My dissertation research used red-sided garter s nakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) to examine the role of the HPA axis in regulating seasonal life-history transitions, especially in females. In Chapter 2, I hypothesize d that seasonal plasticity in stress responses is regulated, in part, by changes in the responsiveness of the adrenal glands to adrenocorticotr​opic hormone (ACTH). I found that glucocorticoid responses to ACTH challenge were smaller in males than in females during the spring, suggesting that reports of reduced stress responsiveness in males may reflect lower adrenal responsiveness to ACTH. The sex difference in mating season duration and consequently also in the timing of migration led me to hypothesize that sex differences in HPA axis activity could explain sex differences in the timing of migration. Furthermore, adrenal responsiveness to ACTH also varied seasonally in males, but not females, suggesting that female stress responses, which have not been studied, may not vary seasonally. In Chapter 3, I addressed this gap in our knowledge and investigated potential seasonal variation in female stress responses. In males, baseline glucocorticoids decrease over the course of the mating season resulting in significantly lower baseline levels in males that have begun to migrate. I hypothesized that a change in HPA axis activity occurs during spring and fall migration. Peak stress-induced glucocorticoid concentration occurred at an earlier sampling time in females during the spring compared to the fall. Peak stress-induced glucocorticoid concentrations also occurred at a later sampling time in migrating females than in pre-migratory females during the spring, suggesting that negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis changes as soon as females begin to migrate during the spring compared to the fall. Peak stress-induced glucocorticoid concentrations also occurred at a later sampling time in migrating females than in pre-migratory females during the spring, suggesting that negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis changes as soon as females begin to migrate during the spring. Female red-sided garter snake populations found in Manitoba are biennial breeders that give birth approximately every other year implying that a female’s recent reproductive history can influence whether or not she will reproduce in a given year. Body condition can be used as a proxy for recent reproductive history and can be related to baseline and stress-induced glucocorticoid concentrations. In Chapter 4, I hypothesized that hormonal and behavioral stress responses vary with body condition. Baseline glucocorticoids did not vary with body condition, but females in low body condition showed a significantly larger increase in plasma glucocorticoids in response to capture stress. Body condition, but not capture stress, influenced latency to copulate, suggesting that females are resistant to the behavioral effects of capture stress during the spring mating season. Only females in low body condition increased latency to copulate in response to injection of a physiological (15 μg) dose of exogenous CORT, while all females responded to a pharmacological (60 μg) dose, indicating that behavioral responses to exogenous glucocorticoids vary with female body condition. These data suggest that variation in body condition may be associated with dif ferences in HPA axis sensitivity and/or glucocorticoid receptor (GR) density in the brain. I directly tested if there is a relationship among body condition, reproductive history and HPA axis activity in Chapter 5. I found that glucocorticoid stress respo nses and mating behavior did not vary with body condition, nor was body condition related to brain GR or reproductive condition (parturient vs post-parturient females ). Only unreceptive females showed a significant stress-induced increase in glucocorticoids​, suggesting that reduced stress responsiveness is associated with receptivity. Parturient females mated faster (were more proceptive) than post-parturient females. These data suggest that HPA axis activity influences reproductive “decisions” by modulatin g receptivity, while proceptivity is related primarily to recent reproductive history. Together, these chapters help characterize how HPA axis activity varies with season, sex, reproductive history and migration status. By systematically probing the HPA ax is in a single, tractable system, I have gained insight into how changes in the HPA axis support and modulate transitions between life-history stages. These results highlight the HPA axis’ important function in mediating the critical trade-offs all animals must navigate to be successful in a changing world.","Dayger, Catherine Anne",ORESU-Y-17-005,ORESU-Y-17-005,E/INT-146,theses/disserta​tions,2017,Oregon Sea Grant,"Why Do Animals Do What They Do, When They Do It?

For near-shore tsunami events, Oregon surfers, who recreate in the nearshore region, must make life or death choices when deciding what to do in the case of a Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquake. First hand accounts from recent global tsunamis indicate that surfers may improve their opportunities for selfrescue, if they identify early warning signs. Site specific characteristics also matter. At some surf spots, the wave breaks close to shore and there is high ground nearby. At other sites, surfers are not able to exit the water and reach high ground prior to the arrival of the first wave. In order to reach out to surfers and share potentially life-saving information, more research is needed regarding surfers’ perceptions of the risks involved in surfing and the tsunami hazard, and how their perceptions compare to other risks in everyday life. This study attempts to better understand how Oregon surfers perceive risk in general, and specifically tsunami risks. Furthermore, it examines if surfers’ risk perceptions also lead to positive intent to change behavior. To address these questions, survey data is used to examine the relationships between perceptions of surfing, tsunami, and every day risks, as well as interactions with demographic information, perceptions of locus-​of-​control, and risk mitigation behaviors. Results from this study will have important Implications for outreach and education within this community, as well as contribute to our scientific understanding of this understudied population. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, non-parametric correlations, and a path analysis are used to address these issues. Surfers in the study correctly identified their own board as the greatest surfing hazard. Participants tended to over estimate surfing hazards when compared to general hazards. Locus of control did not have statistically significant relationships with any of the other variables. A path model including demographic traits, general risk perceptions, surfing risk perceptions, and surfing mitigation behaviors was supported by the path analysis. Qualitative insights from conversations with surfers indicate that they are able to understand technical information about tsunamis and are hungry for more knowledge.","Shelby, Daniel",ORESU-Y-17-006,ORESU-Y-17-006,R/CNH-26,theses/disserta​tions,2017,Oregon Sea Grant,Surfing the Cascadia Subduction Zone: Risk Perceptions and Evacuation Knowledge among Oregon Surfers,Master of Science thesis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This research used the city of Seaside on the Oregon coast as a study site to create the agent-based tsunami evacuation modeling and simulation platform with an explicit focus on the transportation network. The results indicated that (1) the network bridges are not equally important and some of the critical links are counterintuitiv​e and (2) the diverse ways of spending the limited retrofitting resources can generate dramatically different life safety outcomes.

Using population-​based methods (F-statistics), evidence for weak genetic differentiation was found among 12 sites in Oregon that did not conform to a pattern of isolation by distance. Whereas individual-​based methods (kinship analyses) indicated higher than expected relatedness in two Oregon sites, this finding did not help interpret the pattern of genetic differentiation observed among sites in the CCS. Extending our analyses to British Columbia, it was determined that genetic diversity within the Boundary Bay population was comparable to that observed for Oregon, whereas genetic diversity within Alison Sound was considerably lower. Furthermore, genetic connectivity between Oregon and British Columbia was reduced as Alison Sound was genetically distinct from all Oregon sites, whereas Boundary Bay was genetically differentiated from several Oregon sites. In accordance, a Bayesian clustering approach provided support for two genetic groups: (1) Oregon and Boundary Bay and (2) Alison Sound. Kinship analysis revealed a high degree of relatedness within Alison Sound which helps explain the observed pattern of population differentiation​. By combining population-​based and individual-​based approaches, these results demonstrate that connectivity between ocean and fjord-like areas is reduced and may lead to elevated kinship in isolated populations.","O’Malley, Kathleen G.;Corbett, Kelly;Beacham, Terry D.;Jacobson, David P.;Jackson, Tyler M.;Roegner, G.

We sampled individuals at 33 sites in 2012 to establish a baseline of genetic diversity and hierarchal population genetic structure and then assessed interannual variability in our estimates by sampling again in 2014. Genetic diversity showed little variation among sites or across years. In 2012, we observed weak genetic differentiation among sites (FST range = −0.005–​0.014) following a pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) and significantly high relatedness among individuals within nine sampling sites. In 2014, pairwise FST estimates were lower (FST range = −0.014–​0.007), there was no spatial autocorrelation​, and fewer sites had significant evidence of relatedness. Based on these findings, we propose that interannual variation in the physical oceanographic conditions of the CCS influences larval recruitment and thus gene flow, contributing to interannual variation in population genetic structure. Estimates of effective population size (Ne) were large in both 2012 and 2014. Together, our results suggest that Dungeness crab in the CCS may constitute a single evolutionary population, although geographically limited dispersal results in an ephemeral signal of IBD.

Yet, functional mechanisms by which cetaceans detect prey across different scales remain unclear. Here, I postulate that cetaceans utilize a scale dependent, multimodal sensory system to assess and increase prey encounters. I review the literature on cetacean sensory systems related to foraging ecology, and hypothesize the effective scales of each sensory modality to inform foraging opportunities. Next, I build two “scale-​of-​senses” schematics for the general groups of dolphins and baleen whales. These schematics illustrate the hypothetical interchange of sensory modalities used to locate and discriminate prey at spatial scales ranging from 0 m to 1,000 km: (1) vision, (2) audition (sound production and sound reception), (3) chemoreception, (4) magnetoreceptio​n, and somatosensory perception of (5) prey, or (6) oceanographic stimuli.The schematics illustrate how a cetacean may integrate sensory modalities to form an adaptive foraging landscape as a function of distance to prey. The scale-of-senses schematic is flexible, allowing for case-specific application and enhancement with improved cetacean sensory data.

This is especially true in aquatic environments where shifts in spatial ecology (which are a result of movements) are among the first adaptive responses of animals to changes in ecosystems. Changes in the movement and distribution of individuals will in turn alter population dynamics and ecosystem structure. Thus, understanding the drivers and impacts of variation in animal movements over time is critical to conservation and spatial planning. Here, we identify key challenges that impede aquatic animal movement science from informing management and conservation, and propose strategies for overcoming them. Challenges include: (1) Insufficient communication between terrestrial and aquatic movement scientists that could be increased through cross-​pollination of analytical tools and development of new tools and outputs; (2) Incomplete coverage in many studies of animal space use (e.g., entire life span not considered); (3) Insufficient data archiving and availability; (4) Barriers to incorporating movement data into decision-making processes; and (5) Limited understanding of the value of movement data for management and conservation.

Here, we assess the spatiotemporal overlap between the vulnerable Campbell Albatross Thalassarche impavida and large ([28 m) commercial fishing boats in New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). We used a novel analytical approach, bivariate Gaussian bridge movement modelling, to compute spatiotemporal utilization distributions of birdborne global positioning system (GPS) loggers and data from the Vessel Monitoring System. We tracked birds for 28,815 h during incubation and chick brooding, with half of this time spent within New Zealand’s EEZ, utilizing6.7% of the available area.

We accounted for the broader ecological footprint of fishing vessels by calculating the distance between GPS-fix locations for albatrosses and fishing vessels, revealing that albatrosses were within30 km of fishing vessels in 8.4% of foraging trips. This highlights differences in estimated fine-scale spatiotemporal overlaps which may be due to the distance between albatrosses and vessels or the methods used. Overall, the low levels of spatial overlap could be a result of Campbell Albatross’ preference for foraging in areas without fishing activity or competitive exclusion by other species. Our results reinforce the importance of multi-scale, temporally explicit, and multi-national approaches to risk assessment, as Campbell Albatrosses spend approximately half of their time foraging outside New Zealand’s EEZ.","Sztukowski, Lisa A.;van Toor, Mariëlle L.;Weimerskirch, Henri;Thompson, David R.;Torres, Leigh G.;Sagar, Paul M.;Cotton, Peter A.;Votier, Stephen C.",ORESU-R-17-021,ORESU-R-17-021,A/ESG-07,reprints (peer-reviewed),2017,Oregon Sea Grant,Tracking reveals limited interactions between Campbell Albatross and fisheries during the breeding season,NA,NA,"Journal of Ornithology, 158(3):725-735, July 2017",NA,10.1007/s10336-​016-​1425-​4,Springer,NA

In this study, we use the delay in shell formation associated with exposure to CO2-acidified seawater to identify genes correlated with initial shell deposition.By fitting linear models to gene expression data in ambient and low aragonite saturation treatments, we are able to isolate 37 annotated genes correlated with initial larval shell formation, which can be categorized into 1) ion transporters, 2) shell matrix proteins and 3) protease inhibitors. Clustering of the gene expression data into co-expression networks further supports the result of the linear models, and also implies an important role of dynein motor proteins as transporters of cellular components during the initial shell formation process.Using an RNA-Seq approach with high temporal resolution allows us to identify a conceptual model for how oyster larval calcification is initiated.

Landings of forage species are projected to increase in the future, and this harvest may affect marine ecosystems and predator-prey interactions by removal or redistribution of biomass central to pelagic food webs. In particular, fisheries targeting forage fish and euphausiids may be in competition with seabirds, likely the most sensitive of marine vertebrates given limitations in their foraging abilities (ambit and gape size) and high metabolic rate, for food resources. Lately, apparent competition between fisheries and seabirds has led to numerous high-profile conflicts over interpretations​, as well as the approaches that could and should be used to assess the magnitude and consequences of fisheries seabird resource competition. In this paper, we review the methods used to date to study fisheries competition with seabirds, and present “best practices” for future resource competition assessments. Documenting current fisheries competition with seabirds generally involves addressing two major issues: 1) are fisheries causing localized prey depletion that is sufficient to affect the birds? (i.e., are fisheries limiting food resources?), and 2) how are fisheries-​induced changes to forage stocks affecting seabird populations given the associated functional or numerical response relationships? Previous studies have been hampered by mismatches in the scale of fisheries, fish, and seabird data, and a lack of causal understanding due to confounding by climatic and other ecosystem factors (e.g., removal of predatory fish). Best practices for fisheries-​seabird competition research should include i) clear articulation of hypotheses, ii) data collection (or summation) of fisheries, fish, and seabirds on matched spatio-temporal scales, and iii) integration of observational and experimental (including numerical simulation) approaches to establish connections and causality between fisheries and seabirds. As no single technique can provide all the answers to this vexing issue, an integrated approach is most promising to obtain robust scientific results and in turn the sustainability of forage fish fisheries from an ecosystem perspective.","Sydemana, William J.;Thompson, Sarah Ann;Anker-Nilssen, Tycho;Arimitsu, Mayumi;Bennison, Ashley;Bertrand, Sophie;Boersch-Supan, Philipp;Boyd, Charlotte;Bransome, Nicole C.;Crawford, Robert J.

To determine whether reduced dissolved O2 level has a role in KHV reactivation during temperature stress, KHV reactivation was investigated in KHV latently infected koi (KHV+ koi) under stress temperatures by maintaining dissolved O2 consistent with the O2 level at 15 °C. There was no significant difference in the amount of reactivated virus between KHV+ koi maintained with and without O2 supplementation during temperature stress. Both handling and sampling were found to be stressful to koi and can contribute to KHV reactivation from latency.

While it is most often associated with unsightly growths known as ‘carp pox,’ the underlying lesion (epidermal hyperplasia) can arise from a variety of disease processes. CyHV1-induced epidermal hyperplasia may occur transiently in response to water temperature, and thus histopathology cannot be used in isolation to assess CyHV1 infection status. To address this problem, here we describe a PCR assay targeted to the putative thymidine kinase gene of CyHV1. The PCR assay generates a 141 bp amplicon and reliably detects down to 10 copies of control plasmid DNA sequence (analytic sensitivity). The PCR does not cross-detect genomic DNA from cyprinid herpesvirus 2 and 3 (analytic specificity). The CyHV1 PCR effectively detected viral DNA in koi and common carp sampled from various locations in the UK, USA,Brazil, and Japan. Viral DNA was detected in both normal appearing and grossly affected epidermal tissues from koi experiencing natural epizootics. The new CyHV1 PCR provides an additional approach to histopathology for the rapid detection of CyHV1. Analysis of the thymidine kinase gene sequences determined for 7 PCR-positive carp originating from disparate geographical regions identified 3 sequence types, with 1 type occurring in both koi and common carp.","Viadanna, Pedro H.

Whales breeding in New Caledonia occupy both ecosystems: a coastal reef complex (South Lagoon) and oceanic seamounts (Southern Seamounts). Generalized additive models were applied to 20 years of boat-based whale observations (n = 1,526) to describe habitat preferences and permissive home range estimations were used to explicitly model spatial segregation in relation to social context. Groups with calves (n = 206) preferred shallow coastal waters throughout the season in the South Lagoon, whereas no habitat segregation was observed between groups with (n = 74) and without calves (n = 140) in the Southern Seamounts. As a result, spatial overlap between groups with and without calves was more common in the Southern Seamounts than the South Lagoon. Despite a lack of social segregation around seamounts, mother-calf pairs were proportionally more frequent in the Southern Seamounts (27%) than in the South Lagoon (16%). Photographs of the calves’ dorsal flanks were analyzed to compare age and ecological markers across sites. Calves appeared older in the Southern Seamounts than in the South Lagoon but no difference in scarring or shark bites was found across sites, suggesting that calves experienced similar lifestyles and may move between offshore and coastal waters during the breeding season. This study highlights the flexible habitat-use patterns of breeding humpback whales and raises new questions about the environmental and social drivers of their presence in offshore breeding grounds.","Derville, Solène;Torres, Leigh G.;Garrigue, Claire",ORESU-R-18-004,ORESU-R-18-004,A/ESG-07,reprints (peer-reviewed),2018,Oregon Sea Grant,Social segregation of humpback whales in contrasted coastal and oceanic breeding habitats,NA,https://academi​c.oup.com/jmamm​al/article/99/1​/41/4820410,"Journal of Mammalogy, 99(1):41-54, Published online, doi: 10.1093/jmammal​/gyx185, January 23, 2018",NA,10.1093/jmammal​/gyx185,NA,NA

We examine how variations in local priorities drive the co-development of different policies and policy scenario narratives across the two locations, and how metrics of importance to local stakeholders (e.g., the number of buildings impacted by flooding) change over time under different climate and policy scenarios. We also explore the scalability of this approach, and provide recommendations for continuing to utilize the co-developed alternative futures process.

Further focus on the mechanistic relationships among ESs and their underlying biophysical processes provides greater insight into the causes of variation and covariation among ESs, thus serving as a guide to enhance their supply while preventing adverse outcomes. Here, we used the U.S. Pacific Northwest coastal dune ecosystem to examine how invasive beach grass management affects three ESs: coastal protection, western snowy plover conservation, and endemic fore dune plant conservation. At seven coastal dune habitat restoration areas, we observed spatial variation in the supply of each ES and further identified a tradeoff between western snowy plover conservation and coastal protection. While the ESs were collectively influenced by the invasive beach grasses and the fore dunes they create, the magnitude of the synergies and tradeoffs were influenced by numerous non-shared drivers, including nearshore geomorphology, changes in fore dune shape as a result of restoration, and other management actions irrespective of restoration. Incorporation of these shared and non-shared drivers into future coastal management planning may reduce tradeoffs among Pacific Northwest dune ESs. With better understanding of ES relationships, it becomes possible to identify management actions that may enhance synergies and mitigate tradeoffs, leading to better decisions for nature and people.","Biel, Reuben G.;Hacker, Sally D.;Ruggiero, Peter;Cohn, Nicholas;Seabloom, Eric W.",ORESU-R-17-027,ORESU-R-17-027,R/HBT-20,reprints (peer-reviewed),2017,Oregon Sea Grant,Coastal protection and conservation along sandy beaches and dunes: context-​dependent tradeoffs in ecosystem services,Open Access article,NA,"Ecosphere, 8(4):Article e01791, published online doi: 10.1002/ecs2.17​91, May 31, 2017.",NA,10.1002/ecs2.17​91,NA,NA

Overall, the findings from this dissertation research demonstrates the complex and interdependent connection between biological invasions and climate change on community structure, ecological processes, and ecosystem services of the U.S. Pacific Northwest coastal dunes. For management of coastal dunes, this research examines multiple factors that may contribute to the present-day distribution and abundance of the two Ammophila species, and their potential to spread to new areas in the coming decades. Moreover, I demonstrated why the two Ammophila species produce distinct dune shapes and resultantly exhibit differing amounts of protection against flooding and erosion hazards. Finally, although I found that Ammophila removal for plover conservation created tradeoffs in ecosystem service supply, strategic management can minimize tradeoff severity and alleviate potential conflicts among stakeholders. For Pacific Northwest coastal management, these findings can help to inform coastal managers of the potential for changes in the distribution of the two Ammophila species, their impacts on dune ecosystems and the services that they provide, and some possible strategies possible strategies for establishing new habitat restoration areas for endangered species while managing resources for multiple stakeholders.","Biel, Reuben Gabriel",ORESU-Y-17-008,ORESU-Y-17-008,NA,theses/disserta​tions,2017,Oregon Sea Grant,"Coastal dune ecology, geomorphology, and ecosystem services: How invasive beachgrasses, their interactions, and sediment dynamics shape U.S. Pacific Northwest dunes",Thesis is under an embargo until further notice,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oregon State University,NOAA Sea Grant

The food-​concentrating filter (FCF) is the primary determinant of appendicularian prey selectivity, but the precise means by which it concentrates and conveys particles to the pharyngeal filter remain poorly understood. Researchers used high-speed videography to examine the mechanics of the FCF of Oikopleura dioica with high resolution to better understand how filter structure, hydrodynamics, and animal behavior affect feeding selectivity. Researchers observed that filtration occurs through the process of serial adhesion and detachment of particles, and in this respect, differs from an industrial tangential filtration system. Researchers demonstrate how filter elasticity and the hydrodynamics of pulsatile flow caused by the kinematics of the animal’s tail contribute to the filter’s self-cleaning abilities. Researchers present experimental observations showing that smaller particles (3 lm) adhere significantly more to the filter than larger ones (10 lm), but that, overall adhesion is quite low for an array of particle sizes (3–20 lm). This study provides a mechanistic basis for predicting the effects of appendicularian grazing on particle size spectra in the upper ocean.","Conley, Keats R.;Gemmell, Brad J.;Bouquet, Jean-Marie;Thompson, Eric M.;Sutherland, Kelly R.",ORESU-R-18-006,ORESU-R-18-006,E/INT-129,reprints (peer-reviewed),2018,Oregon Sea Grant,A self-cleaning biological filter: How appendicularian​s mechanically control particle adhesion and removal,NA,NA,"Limnology and Oceanography, 63 (2):927-938, 2018",NA,10.1002/lno.106​80,NA,NA

Although ascidian feeding has been extensively investigated, the organismal-​scale fluid dynamics and mesh-​scale particle-​filter interactions are not fully characterized. Fluorescein dye visualization of flow through the branchial sac of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis showed organismal-​scale flow was laminar and moved both parallel and perpendicular to the mucous mesh. Endoscopic investigations of Herdmania momus revealed the mesh-scale filtration process, including the pre-​capture velocities, particle approach angles, and mesh behavior. The mesh speed was variable (range 0–0.4 mm s−1). To determine how particle shape affects hydrosol capture, Styela plicata was fed differently shaped polystyrene particles (ellipsoids and spheres); sampling the inhaled and exhaled water revealed that microellipsoids (0.3 × 0.7 μm) were captured at significantly lower efficiency (32%) than 1 μm microspheres (86%). The capture efficiency of microellipsoids resembled that of microspheres with a diameter similar to the microellipsoids​’ minor axis (0.3 μm, 31%) suggesting that the minimum diameter of ellipsoidal particles determines the capture efficiency. Flow near the filter was parallel to the mesh even ~ 10 s of micrometers away, implicating a “crossflow” component to ascidian filtration, where the fluid being filtered is directed along the surface of the filter rather than exclusively perpendicular to it. Collectively, these results suggest that ascidian filtration acts as a hybrid-flow filtration system rather than a classical direct sieve.","Conley, Keats R.;Ben-Tal, Aviv;Jacobi, Yuval;Yahel, Gitai;Sutherland, Kelly R.",ORESU-R-18-007,ORESU-R-18-007,E/INT-129,reprints (peer-reviewed),2018,Oregon Sea Grant,Not-so-simple sieving by ascidians: re-examining particle capture at the mesh and organismal scales,NA,NA,"Marine Biology,165(3):​45-​58, March 2018",NA,10.1007/s00227-​018-​3300-​8,NA,NA

Increasing severity of hypoxia along the Oregon coast in recent years has prompted investigations into the response of biota in this region. Researchers used summer data (2008-2013) from a beam trawl survey targeting juvenile demersal fishes in soft-bottom habitats along the Oregon coast to describe patterns of distribution and abundance at fixed sampling stations (from 30m to 100m depth). Researchers relate the assemblage and abundance of the common species to environmental variables and analyze condition of recently settled fish (<50mm SL). Most of the captured fishes were young-​of-​the-​year flatfishes, dominated by Butter Sole (Isopsetta isolepis), English Sole (Parophrys vetulus), Speckled Sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus), and Pacific Sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus). Community analysis of the full dataset showed some variation in species richness among years and high evenness across all sampling sites and years. Depth was a structuring variable for the community, indicated by multivariate nonmetric multidimensiona​l scaling analysis. Generalized additive models for common flatfish species abundances during the summer months indicated depth preferences, with Butter Sole, English Sole, and Speckled Sanddab at shallower locations and Pacific Sanddab occurring at deeper locations farther offshore. Additionally, while most common species were collected in high abundances in hypoxic conditions, dissolved oxygen was a significant factor in determining flatfish abundance. Condition factor was weakly negatively impacted by low dissolved oxygen for the species assessed, but the strength of the relationship varied by species. Increased sampling frequency and spatial coverage would improve our understanding of this community, especially in light of changing environmental drivers such as decreasing pH, warming water, and episodic periods of low dissolved oxygen coinciding with settlement for many species.","Sobocinskia, Kathryn L.;Ciannellia, Lorenzo;Wakefield, W.

They feed using an adhesive mucous mesh to capture prey particles from ambient seawater. Historically, their grazing process has been characterized as non-selective, depending only on the size of the prey particle and the pore dimensions of the mesh. The purpose of this review is to reverse this assumption by reviewing recent evidence that shows mucous-mesh feeding can be selective. Researchers focus on large planktonic microphages as a model of selective mucus feeding because of their important roles in the ocean food web: as bacterivores, prey for higher trophic levels, and exporters of carbon via mucous aggregates, faecal pellets and jelly-falls. Researchers identify important functional variations in the filter mechanics and hydrodynamics of different taxa. Researchers review evidence that shows this feeding strategy depends not only on the particle size and dimensions of the mesh pores, but also on particle shape and surface properties, filter mechanics, hydrodynamics and grazer behavior. As many of these organisms remain critically understudied, investigators conclude by suggesting priorities for future research.","Conley, Keats R.;Lombard, Fabien;Sutherland, Kelly R.",ORESU-R-18-009,ORESU-R-18-009,E/INT-129,reprints (peer-reviewed),2018,Oregon Sea Grant,Mammoth grazers on the ocean’s minuteness: a review of selective feeding using mucous meshes,NA,NA,"Proceedings of The Royal Society B, 285: 20180056, April 2018",NA,10.1098/rspb.20​18.0056,NA,NA

The pHstat is self-regulating through the use of interchangeable electronically controlled reagent or gas-mediated pH-modification manifolds, both of which feature flow regulation by solenoid valves. Although effective pH control was achieved using both liquid reagent additions and gas-mediated methods, the liquid manifold exhibited tighter control (±0.03 pH units) of the desired pH than the gas manifold (±0.10 pH units).

As a result, a 10-year network visioning effort, ""Looking Outward and Reaching Inward: Building Sea Grant Resilience from the Lens of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,"" was initiated to help Sea Grant reach broader audiences by embracing and adopting best practices regarding DEI. Sea Grant program personnel are defining their roles in advancing DEI, reviewing current conditions, and building awareness of best practices across the network. The SGID CoP has representation from all 33 Sea Grant programs, as well as the National Sea Grant Office and Sea Grant Advisory Board. The CoP’s vision is that Sea Grant empowers coastal communities to be resilient in the face of change. To that end, Sea Grant must implement initiatives to embrace DEI to proactively engage, reflect, and serve the diverse populations of coastal communities. The CoP envisions Sea Grant as a champion of DEI principles in which all coastal community members are respected and valued. The CoP defines DEI as core values or principles for Sea Grant in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. In other words, ""Diversity is where everyone is invited to the party. Equity means that everyone gets to contribute to the playlist. Inclusion means that everyone has the opportunity to dance."" (- Robert Sellers, Chief Diversity Officer at the University of Michigan). We live in a world where diverse perspectives may conflict with one another, yet be simultaneously valid. Some communities have easy access to decision makers, while others struggle to have their voices heard. To better communicate complex scientific data and create actionable outcomes, Sea Grant must hone its strategies to include diverse audiences, and these strategies must be tested and evaluated. The primary focus of this paper is on specific DEI topic areas that feature case studies submitted by Sea Grant programs. These case studies outline best practices for applying DEI principles across the Sea Grant network. DEI topic areas include: ● Research: Broadening Participation and Building Capacity ● Extension: Equitably Serving our Coastal Communities ● Education: Inclusive Pre-K - 12th Grade Programming ● Communications: Reaching an Array of Audiences ● University Student Connections: Expanding the Next Generation Workforce ● Environmental Justice ● Professional Development ● Recruiting and Retaining a Diverse Workforce.","Antonucci, Claire;Auyong, Marie;Behl, Mona;Burich, Diana;Chan, Sam;Covi, Michelle;Faulds, Ann;Harrison, Jane;Kolesar, Sarah;Lewandowski, Ed;Lovelace, Susan;Merrill, Jen;Peroff, Deidre;Pleasant, Mary",NCU-Q-18-002,NA,NA,"program reports (annual, progress, planning reports, etc)",2018,North Carolina Sea Grant,"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: Current Conditions and Best Practices across the National Sea Grant Network",NA,NA,NA,"Harrison, Jane;Woodward, Emily",NA,NA,NA

Its impacts range from impeding navigation to entangling wildlife and fouling beaches. Research helps explore this issue, bridges knowledge gaps, and supports prevention and reduction efforts. In the recently-​released Oregon Marine Debris Action Plan (OR MDAP), local stakeholders identified future research actions to help combat marine debris. One such action was to, ""Develop research priorities for marine debris in Oregon with a focus on sources and reduction strategies. Encourage research to quantify and prevent the impacts of marine debris"". The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Debris Program and Oregon Sea Grant volunteered to co-lead this action, with Oregon State University (OSU) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as partners. Together this group engaged local stakeholders, generated ideas, and held a workshop discussing and prioritizing research to help address marine debris in Oregon. The OR MDAP contains a local stakeholder-​generated Marine Debris Priority List. It includes a research section that lists ideas relevant to Oregon, which the organizers sent to OR MDAP participants and other practitioners prior to the workshop. These parties reviewed, ranked, and added to the research topics, with a focus on addressing knowledge gaps. Based on their replies, the workshop organizers drafted a marine debris research priorities list. They invited participants to attend a one-day workshop at OSU Corvallis, Oregon for evaluating and prioritizing these research ideas. On May 30, 2017, twenty-four marine debris researchers and practitioners came together for the first Oregon Marine Debris Research Priorities Workshop.

At least nine tsunami deposits dating back 2500 yr are preserved as fine sand layers in peaty tidal marsh deposits. Discovery Bay is a setting that amplifies tsunami waves, has an abundant sediment source, and a tidal marsh that traps and preserves tsunami deposits. The youngest deposit, bed 1, is probably from the 1700 A.D. Cascadia earthquake. Bed 2 has a newly revised age of 630–560 cal yr B.P. (1320–1390 A.D.), an age range that overlaps with the ages of tsunami deposits from Vancouver, British Columbia, and northern Oregon, as well as evidence for strong shaking in the region including submarine and sublacustrine slope failures. However, there is no geologic evidence for a late fourteenth-​century earthquake or tsunami in any of the southwest Washington estuaries that record seven Cascadia earthquakes in the last 3500 yr. Discovery Bay bed 2 and similar-aged evidence in the region may represent a short rupture on the Cascadia subduction thrust, possibly centered west of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, that did not cause significant coastal subsidence. Other possible sources considered for bed 2 include a crustal fault earthquake, a tsunamigenic slope failure, or a transoceanic tsunami. Older tsunami deposits beds 3–9, which outnumber the number of Cascadia earthquakes in the last 2500 yr, are likely from a combination of Cascadia and non-Cascadia sources. Additional radiocarbon dating of beds 3–9 will improve age ranges and constrain potential sources.","Garrison-Laney, Carrie;Miller, Ian",WASHU-BR-17-003,WSG-CH 17-03,A/ACE-1,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2017,Washington Sea Grant,"Tsunamis in the Salish Sea: recurrence, sources, hazards",ISBN: 9780813756493,https://pubs.ge​oscienceworld.o​rg/books/book/2​047/chapter/112​413671/tsunamis​-​in-​the-​salish-​sea-​recurrence-​sources (Chapter info),"From the Puget Lowland to East of the Cascade Range: Geologic Excursions in the Pacific Northwest, The Geological Society of America Field Guide Volume 49, Ralph A.

As part of that evaluation, several studies are focusing on the impact of the reserves on coastal communities. This project focused on tribal members with ancestral territory on the Oregon coast. Tribal members from three tribes, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, the Coquille Indian Tribe, and the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians were interviewed for this project. The interviews centered around two themes: 1) past and present use of marine and coastal species, and 2) experiences and opinions about the implementation and policies of Oregon’s marine reserves. A mapping exercise in which tribal members marked where they gathered species was performed concurrently with the interviews. Shared patterns in the interview narratives around changes in plant/animal populations, habitats, and land uses are the focus on Chapter 2. Spatial information from the mapping exercise is the focus of Chapter 3. Chapter 4 briefly introduces techniques for efficiently engaging with tribes on resource management projects, using this project as the example application for the techniques. Over 150 species were reported by 28 participants in 23 interviews, and the areas marked during the mapping exercise covered over 12,000 square kilometers. Several trends were corroborated across interviews, including the timing of two smelt populations, and the crash and slow recovery of the Starry Flounder. There was traditional/sub​sistence use reported in areas overlapping four of the five marine reserves in Oregon, although some of the activity had stopped well before the implementation of the reserves.

This research reports on a large-scale study of macrophyte wrack deposition patterns on the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast. Researchers measured macrophyte wrack on 12 sandy beach sites from southern Washington to northern California. The highest wrack biomass (g m-2) occurred on southern beaches but the greatest wrack patch density (number m-2) occurred on northern beaches, resulting in some northern sites having orders of magnitude more wrack than other sites. Eelgrass (Zostera marina and Z. japonica) was present in wrack in the greatest proportions at northern sites, and kelp (e.g. Nereocystis luetkeana and Macrocystis integrifolia) was present in the greatest proportions at central and southern sites. Further analyses showed that the proximity of estuary and rocky reef habitats, ocean upwelling, and beach geomorphology and wave climate all contributed to the biogeographic patterns of beach wrack.

Based on a degree-day modeling approach, researchers developed a new metric, the ocean acidification stress index for shellfish (OASIS), for this purpose. OASIS integrates over the entire larval period the instantaneous stress associated with deviations from published sensitivity thresholds to aragonite saturation state (?Ar) while experiencing variable carbonate chemistry. Researchers measured survival to D-hinge and pre-settlement stage of four Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) cohorts with different histories of carbonate chemistry exposure at the Whiskey Creek Hatchery, Netarts Bay, OR, to test the utility of OASIS as a stress metric and document the effects of buffering seawater in mitigating acute and chronic exposure to ocean acidification. Each cohort was divided into four groups and reared under the following conditions: 1) stable, buffered seawater for the entire larval period; 2) stable, buffered seawater for the first 48 hours, then naturally variable, unbuffered seawater; 3) stable, unbuffered seawater for the first 48 hours, then buffered seawater; and 4) stable, unbuffered seawater for the first 48 hours, then naturally variable, unbuffered seawater. Patterns in Netarts Bay carbonate chemistry were dominated by seasonal upwelling at the time of the experimental work, resulting in naturally highly variable ?Ar for the larvae raised in the unbuffered treatments. Two of the four cohorts showed strongly positive responses to buffering in survival to 48 hours; three of the four, in survival to pre-settlement. OASIS accurately predicted survival for two of the three cohorts tested (the fourth was excluded due to other environmental factors), suggesting this new metric could be used to better understand larval bivalve survival in naturally variable environments. OASIS may also be useful to an array of diverse stakeholders with increasing access to highly resolved temporal measurements of carbonate chemistry.","Gimenez, Iria;Waldbusser, George G.;Hales, Burke",ORESU-R-18-012,ORESU-R-18-012,R/SAQ-19,reprints (peer-reviewed),2018,Oregon Sea Grant,Ocean acidification stress index for shellfish (OASIS): Linking Pacific oyster larval survival and exposure to variable carbonate chemistry regimes,Open access article,http://doi.org/​10.1525/element​a.306,"Elementa Science of the Anthropocene, 6(1):51, July 16, 2018",NA,10.1525/element​a.306,University of California Press,NA10OAR4170049

By the summer of 2017, pyrosomes appeared in unprecedented numbers along the entire west coast, reaching the Western Gulf of Alaska, but showed some of their highest abundances off Oregon clogging nets and disrupting marine activities such as commercial and sport fisheries. The impacts of these dense blooms and the extent on ecological interactions are unknown. Moreover, their appearance in multiple years and the capacity to reach bloom proportions suggests that pyrosomes may even thrive in colder waters, especially during more oligotrophic conditions, and could become more permanent residents in the California Current marine ecosystem. Their continued presence will likely become a nuisance for certain fishing activities, causing fishermen to relocate or spend extra time sorting their catch. Large pyrosome aggregations have the potential to restructure energy flows through food webs via efficient removal of photosynthetic plankton and subsequent fecal pellet production, consumption by higher trophic levels, or sinking to depth.","Sutherland, Kelly R.;Sorensen, Hilarie L.;Blondheim, Olivia N.;Brodeur, Richard D.;Galloway, Aaron W.

Researchers tracked whales and vessels during the summer 2015 using non-invasive, shore-based theodolite and photo identification techniques. Researchers monitored two sites along the Oregon coast with differing levels of vessel traffic for four weeks each. They analyzed tracks of whales using Markov chains to assess behavior state changes relative to location, individual, vessel presence, vessel type, and distance between whale and vessel. Researchers documented significant differences in gray whale activity budgets between control and impact conditions, and between study sites. Researchers did not observe significant differences in individual responses to vessel disturbance.

The objective of this study is to examine the impact of the ‘graying of the fleet’ phenomenon (e.g., the increase in the average age of commercial fishermen) on community resilience in two coastal communities in Oregon. Utilizing qualitative research methods, the occurrence of the graying of the fleet in Oregon, factors contributing to this phenomenon, and implications for fishing community resilience are examined. Data consisted of interviews with commercial fishermen (n=48) and community leaders (n=17). Findings indicate graying is perceived as occurring by members of the fishing industry, but is not a concern for community leaders. Members of the fishing community and local community leaders agree that regulatory changes and shifting societal norms have resulted in notable impacts to commercial fishing fleets and their host communities. Participants identified the important cultural role of the commercial fishing industry to community identity and sense of place, and expressed concerns that changes in tightening fisheries management could detract from this culture.

Decision makers and the public alike are struggling to reconcile the lack of ‘‘fit’’ between a rapidly changing environment and relatively rigid governance structures. In efforts to bridge this environment-​governance gap in Tillamook County, Oregon, stakeholders formed a knowledge-​to-​action network (KTAN). The KTAN examined alternative future coastal policy and climate scenarios through extensive stakeholder engagement and the spatially explicit agent-based modeling framework Envision. The KTAN’s results were further evaluated through a two-step mixed methods approach. First, KTAN-identified metrics were quantitatively assessed and compared under present-day vs. alternative policy scenarios. Second, the feasibility of implementing these policy scenarios was qualitatively evaluated through a review of governmental regulations and semi-structured interviews. The findings show that alternative policy scenarios ranged from significantly beneficial to extremely harmful to coastal buildings and beach accessibility in comparison to present-day policies, and they were relatively feasible to almost impossible to implement. Beneficial policies that lower impacts of flooding and erosion clearly diverge from the existing regulatory environment, which inhibits their implementation. In response, leadership and cross-sector cooperation and coordination can help to overcome mixed interests and motivations, and increase information exchange between and within the public and government organizations.

Achieving an aerial perspective has been restricted to brief helicopter or airplane based observations that are costly, noisy, and risky. The emergence of commercial small-unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has significantly reduced these constraints to provide a stable, relatively quiet, and inexpensive platform that enables replicate observations for prolonged periods with minimal disturbance. The potential of UAS for behavioral observation appears immense, yet quantitative proof of utility as an observational tool is required. We use UAS footage of gray whales foraging in the coastal waters of Oregon, United States to develop video behavior analysis methods, determine the change in observation time enabled by UAS, and describe unique behaviors observed via UAS. Boat-based behavioral observations from 53 gray whale sightings between May and October 2016 were compared to behavioral data extracted from video analysis of UAS flights during those sightings. We used a DJI Phantom 3 Pro or 4 Advanced, recorded video from an altitude _25 m, and detected no behavioral response by whales to the UAS. Two experienced whale ethologists conducted UAS video behavioral analysis, including tabulation of whale behavior states and events, and whale surface time and whale visible time (total time the whale was visible including underwater). UAS provided three times more observational capacity than boat-based observations alone (300 vs. 103 min). When observation time is accounted for, UAS data provided more and longer observations of all primary behavior states (travel, forage, social, and rest) relative to boat-based data, especially foraging. Furthermore, UAS enable documentation of multiple novel gray whale foraging tactics (e.g., headstands: n = 58; side swimming: n = 17; jaw snapping and flexing: n = 10) and 33 social events (nursing and pair coordinated surfacings) not identified from boat-based observation. This study demonstrates the significant added value of UAS to marine megafauna behavior and ecological studies. With technological advances, robust study designs, and effective analytical tools, we foresee increased UAS applications to marine megafauna studies to elucidate foraging strategies, habitat associations, social patterns, and response to human disturbance.","Torres, Leigh G.;Nieukirk, Sharon L.;Lemos, Leila;Chandler, Todd E.",ORESU-R-18-017,ORESU-R-18-017,A/EC OED 2018-21,reprints (peer-reviewed),2018,Oregon Sea Grant,Drone Up!

We tested the hypothesis that a “magnetic map” (i.e., an ability to extract positional information from Earth’s magnetic field) also exists in a population of salmon that do not undertake oceanic migrations. This study examined juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) originally from a nonanadromous population in Maine transferred ∼60 years ago to a lake in central Oregon. We exposed juveniles to magnetic displacements representative of locations at the latitudinal boundaries of the Pacific salmon oceanic range in the North Pacific and at the periphery of their ancestral oceanic range in the North Atlantic. Orientation differed among the magnetic treatments, indicating that Atlantic salmon detect map information from the geomagnetic field. Despite no recent history of ocean migration, these fish displayed adaptive orientation responses similar to those observed in native Pacific salmonids. These findings indicate that use of map information from the geomagnetic field is a shared ancestral character in the family Salmonidae and is not restricted to populations with anadromous life histories. Lastly, given that Atlantic salmon are transported throughout the world for capture fisheries and aquaculture, such a robust navigational system is of some concern.

For example, recent work has shown that the commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug, metformin (N,N-​dimethylbiguani​de), has endocrine disrupting effects on fish. However, effects of metformin on aquatic primary producers are poorly known. We exposed cultured isolates of a freshwater chlorophyte, Chlorella vulgaris, to a range of metformin concentrations (0–767.9 mg L-1) to test the hypothesis that exposure negatively affects photosynthesis and growth. A cessation of growth, increase in non-​photochemical quenching (NPQ, NPQmax), and reduced electron transport rate (ETR) were observed 24 h after exposure to a metformin concentration of 767.8 mg L-1 (4.6 mM). By 48 h, photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), ?, the initial slope of the ETR-irradiance curve, and Ek (minimum irradiance required to saturate photosynthesis) were reduced. At a lower concentration (76.8 mg L-1), negative effects on photosynthesis (increase in NPQ, decrease in ETR) were delayed, occurring between 72 and 96 h. No negative effects on photosynthesis were observed at an exposure concentration of 1.5 mg L-1. It is likely that metformin impairs photosynthesis either through downstream effects from inhibition of complex I of the electron transport chain or via activation of the enzyme, SnRK1 (sucrose non-​fermenting-​related kinase 1), which acts as a cellular energy regulator in plants and algae and is an ortholog of the mammalian target of metformin, AMPK (5' adenosine monophosphate-​activated protein kinase).","Cummings, Brittany M.;Needoba, Joseph A.;Peterson, Tawnya D.",ORESU-R-18-024,ORESU-R-18-024,E/INT-151,reprints (peer-reviewed),2018,Oregon Sea Grant,"Effect of metformin exposure on growth and photosynthetic performance in the unicellular freshwater chlorophyte, Chlorella vulgaris",OPEN ACCESS,NA,"PLoS ONE, 13(11):  e0207041, November 12, 2018",NA,10.1371/journal​.pone.0207041,NA,NA270M-H

Although ocean acidification is likely to influence cellular metabolism and energy balance, the degree to which intracellular pH in phytoplankton differs from the external environment under varying environmental pH levels is not well characterized. While there are numerous existing methods for the determination of intracellular pH in the form of single peak emission (e.g., BCECF) and radioisotopic (e.g., 14C-DMO) indicators for use with phytoplankton, the fluorescent pH indicator seminaphtharhod​afluor (SNARF) has not been established as a robust method for measuring in vivo pH in phytoplankton. SNARF has superior accuracy and sensitivity since it exhibits dual emission peaks from a single excitation wavelength and the ratio of the two are related to pH. The use of a ratio limiting variations in fluorescence due to dye loading, photobleaching, and instrument variation; moreover, like other fluorescence-​based assays, it does not require the specialized equipment and permits that radioisotopic methods do. As a first step, we tested the performance of SNARF for measuring intracellular pH in vivo in a number of phytoplankton taxa. SNARF detection was accomplished using fluorescence spectroscopy (FS) and laser scanning microscopy (LSM). Since SNARF fluorescence is activated by cleavage of an ester group from the core fluorophore by nonspecific esterases, we measured esterase activity using fluorescein diacetate (FDA) to characterize variability in esterase activity among phytoplankton taxa, with a view towards its influence on assay performance. Esterase activity cell volume; however, there was no indication that enzyme specificity and differences in individual esterase profiles adversely affected SNARF performance in phytoplankton. Assays of intracellular pH using SNARF were comparable to those made with 14C-labeled DMO, an accepted standard method. Thus, SNARF provides robust measurements of intracellular pH in phytoplankton, constituting a useful tool in investigations of the effects of ocean acidification and fluctuations in environmental pH on cellular physiology.","Golda-​VanEeckhoutte, Rachel L.;Roof, Lauren T.;Needoba, Joseph A.;Peterson, Tawnya D.",ORESU-R-18-023,ORESU-R-18-023,E/INT-116;M/A-16,reprints (peer-reviewed),2018,Oregon Sea Grant,"Determination of intracellular pH in phytoplankton using the fluorescent probe, SNARF, with detection by fluorescence spectroscopy",NA,NA,"Journal of Microbiological Methods, 152:109-118, August 2018",NA,10.1016/j.mimet​.2018.07.023 SEP 2018,Elsevier,NA

Within hours, two hundred tourists will snorkel, sunbathe, and teeter on the coral, few ever knowing that people fish here or that their catch sustains an entire kaiāulu (community) connected to this stretch of reef.

These benefits depend on how eelgrass communities function: a product of abiotic factors (e.g., fluctuations in water temperature and nutrient regimes and seasonal cycles of sedimentation) and biotic factors (e.g., dispersal and trophic interactions), which vary across local, regional, and temporal scales. In upwelling-​influenced estuaries of the Pacific Northwest coast of the United States, eelgrass systems are exposed to latitudinal variability in oceanographic inputs, but the degree to which these systems are controlled by processes at regional and local scales is largely unknown. In this study, we consider the relationships between primary producers (i.e., eelgrass, ulvoid macroalgae, and epiphytes), epifaunal mesograzers, and fish predators within and across three Oregon estuaries (Netarts Bay, Yaquina Bay, and Coos Bay) during a spring-summer season in order to examine the role of multiple scales in structuring eelgrass communities. Specifically, we ask the following questions. 1) What is the relative importance of local (within estuary) versus regional (across estuaries) scale patterns to eelgrass community structure (i.e., primary producers, epifaunal mesograzers, and fishes) in upwelling-​influenced estuaries in Oregon? 2) What is the potential role of regional oceanography versus trophic interactions in regulating eelgrass community structure, and is this dependent on spatial scale? 3) What are the management implications for eelgrass communities when regional and local scales are considered? We found that regional (across estuary) scale patterns strongly influence community structure in eelgrass communities, providing support that regional bottom-up forcing dominates eelgrass communities in PNW estuaries. Additionally, we found support for some local effects driving patterns of primary producers, epifauna, and fish at particular sites. These results suggest that variation in bottom-up forcing at the regional scale of the California Current is an important driver of community structure and that top-down effects are limited. Such results have important implications for ecosystem-based management as it relates to climate-induced changes in upwelling frequency and intensity and the consequences for eutrophication and ocean acidification.

In estuaries of the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast, eelgrass (Zostera marina) ecosystems are exposed to latitudinally varying oceanographic inputs in the form of ocean upwelling. Previous research suggests that ocean upwelling is critical to eelgrass and ulvoid macroalgae abundance, but the degree to which secondary producers are controlled by processes at regional vs. local scales is unknown. Here, we consider the relationships among primary producers (eelgrass, ulvoid macroalgae, and epiphytic microalgae), epifaunal mesograzers, and mesopredator fish within and across three Oregon, U.S.A., estuaries during a spring– summer season to examine the role of multiple scales in structuring these communities. Our objectives were to determine the relative importance of local and regional scales in organizing eelgrass communities and the potential of regional oceanography and trophic interactions in regulating patterns of primary producers in this system. We found that regional and seasonal patterns strongly influenced eelgrass community structure, providing support for the hypothesis that regional bottom-up forcing predominantly controls these assemblages. Additionally, local effects were important to the patterns of primary producers, mesograzers, and mesopredator fish at specific sites, suggesting limited top–down control. Regarding management and conservation, the implications of our results are that in these highly productive systems, the potential for consumers to moderate the effects of eutrophication may be limited.","Hayduk, Jennifer L.;Hacker, Sally D.;Henderson, Jeremy S.;Tomas, Fiona",ORESU-R-19-004,ORESU-R-19-004,R/ECO-34,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Oregon Sea Grant,Evidence for regional-scale controls on eelgrass (Zostera marina) and mesograzer community structure in upwelling-​influenced estuaries,NA,NA,"Limnology and Oceanography, 00:1-15, Published online January 15, 2019",NA,10.1002/lno.111​02,NA,NA14OAR4170064

We used a spatio-temporal bioenergetics model of the Northeast Pacific Ocean to quantify how predation by three species of pinnipeds and killer whales (Orcinus orca) on Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) has changed since the 1970s along the west coast of North America, and compare these estimates to salmon fisheries. We find that from 1975 to 2015, biomass of Chinook salmon consumed by pinnipeds and killer whales increased from 6,100 to 15,200 metric tons (from 5 to 31.5 million individual salmon). Though there is variation across the regions in our model, overall, killer whales consume the largest biomass of Chinook salmon, but harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) consume the largest number of individuals. The decrease in adult Chinook salmon harvest from 1975–2015 was 16,400 to 9,600 metric tons. Thus, Chinook salmon removals (harvest + consumption) increased in the past 40 years despite catch reductions by fisheries, due to consumption by recovering pinnipeds and endangered killer whales. Long-term management strategies for Chinook salmon will need to consider potential conflicts between rebounding predators or endangered predators and prey.","Chasco, Brandon E.;Kaplan, Isaac C.;Thomas, Austen C.;Acevedo-​Gutiérrez, Alejandro;Noren, Dawn P.;Ford, Michael J.;Hanson, M.

Between 1970 and 2015, we estimate that the annual biomass of Chinook salmon consumed by pinnipeds has increased from 68 to 625 metric tons. Converting juvenile Chinook salmon into adult equivalents, we found that by 2015, pinnipeds consumed double that of resident killer whales and six times greater than the combined commercial and recreational catches.

This pilot study explores some of the requirements for workforce development and the expansion of ocean literacy by introduction of fundamental ocean properties through the application of an open source oceanographic instrument. Three core ocean properties - salinity, temperature, and depth - are collected by a device called a CTD and are prolifically utilized by all disciplines of oceanography, industry, and recreation. Using education and engagement methods similar to the MATE ROV program, eight students from a coastal high school in Oregon were tasked with constructing multiple open source CTDs and participated in a number of experiential learning activities. Student perspectives were captured using pre-assessment and post-assessment questionnaires, providing insight into their interest in STEM, ocean science, and related careers. The student-​constructed devices were then delivered to local commercial fishermen for testing and data collection. Fishermen perspectives were captured using semi-structured interviews focusing on their interest in cooperative science and data use. Six months of observations and data collection suggest that a learning experience centered about an open source CTD does have some impact on student interest in STEM, ocean science, and related careers. The specific use of the device and resultant data does not have a significant influence on fishermen interest in participating in cooperative science, but that interest lies in other unanticipated factors. Proper integration of a marine technology into the learning environment may provide students with skills needed in today's marine workforce and may also provide them with a fundamental oceanographic background for enhanced ocean literacy. Continued cooperation may enhance fishermen understanding and valuation of the marine environment, but potentially in a different capacity from how it is currently understood. This thesis is concluded with some project limitations, suggestions, and several future project ideas that may prove to increase interest in the marine STEM workforce, provide vectors for improved ocean literacy, and lead to pathways for valuation of the marine environment for all.","Black, Ian",ORESU-Y-18-003,ORESU-Y-18-003,R/PSS-02-Strub,theses/disserta​tions,2018,Oregon Sea Grant,Establishing Interest in and Understanding of the Marine Environment: An Educational and Cooperative Approach Utilizing an Open Source CTD,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Northern California Current Ecosystem off the coast of US West Coast experiences seasonal variations in upwelling and down welling patterns creating natural episodes of hypoxia and calcite/aragoni​te under saturation, exacerbating global trends of increasing ocean acidification and hypoxia (OAH) (Chan et al. 2008) (Gruber et al. 2012). The goal of these experiments was to identify thresholds of tolerance and attempt to quantify a point at which variance in responses to stress collapses. This study focuses on two species: Cancer magister (Dungeness crab) and Haliotis rufescens (red abalone). These species were selected for this study based on their economic and ecological value, as well as their taxonomic differences. Respirometry was used as a proxy for metabolic activity at four different scenarios mimicking preindustrial, upwelling, contemporary upwelling, and distant future conditions by manipulating dissolved oxygen and inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. Both species showed a decrease in mean respiration rate as OAH stressors increase, including an effect in contemporary upwelling conditions. These results suggest that current exposure to ocean acidification (OA) and hypoxia do not confer resilience to these stressors for either taxa. In teasing apart the effects of OAH as multiple stressors, it was found that Dungeness crab response was more strongly driven by concentration of dissolved oxygen, while red abalone data suggested a strong interactive effect between OA and hypoxia. Not only did these two different taxa exhibit different responses to a multiple stressors, but the fact that the Dungeness crab were secondarily impacted by acidification could suggest that current management concerns may need to be focus more strongly on deoxygenation.","Gossner, Hannah Margaret",ORESU-Y-18-004,ORESU-Y-18-004,R/ECO-32-Chan,theses/disserta​tions,2018,Oregon Sea Grant,Quantifying Sensitivity and Adaptive Capacity of Shellfish in the Northern California Current Ecosystem to Increasing Prevalence of Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many pharmaceuticals and personal care products are considered contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) due to their bioactive properties. Among these, metformin—the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes—has been reported at high concentrations (μg L-1) in stream, lake, and estuary surface waters in the United States. However, a propensity for broad-scale CEC surveys has prevented seasonal and spatial monitoring of metformin in river systems. Moreover, the effect of metformin in river food webs remains poorly explored, despite its known action on conserved eukaryotic enzymes (AMPK/SnRK1/SNF​1). This project comprised the first spatiotemporal characterizatio​n of metformin in a high-discharge river system and examined the effects of metformin on aquatic primary producers. Monthly water samples were taken at eight year-round sites and five additional summer-sites in the lower Columbia River from October 2016-September 2017. Metformin and its breakdown product, guanylurea, were determined from water samples using direct injection with liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Laboratory toxicity assays using PAM fluorometry and environmentally or sewage relevant doses (50-500 μg L-1) probed for effects of metformin on photosynthetic efficiency in green algae (Chlorella vulgaris) and diatom (Thalassiosira weissflogii) cultures. Metformin and guanylurea were successfully detected and quantified in the lower Columbia River (METAVG = 67.4 ng L-1, GUANAVG = 32.6 ng L-1). High variation in metformin concentrations was only partially explained by seasonal river discharge and riverine sources, but possible sorption effects suggested additional physicochemical influence. Metformin effects on algae depended on exposure time, dose, and species, with reduced photosynthetic efficiency of C. vulgaris cultures within 24 h of high dose exposure (500 μg L-1), and within 72 h of sewage effluent-​equivalent exposure (50 μg L-1). Overall, these results are consistent with the expected behavior of a polar basic cation species in a high-flow river system and a SnRK1-activator in algae. This study illustrates the importance of investigating individual CECs in water systems to elucidate fine-scale processes governing distributions, behavior, and, ultimately, environmental risk.","Cummings, Brittany M.",ORESU-Y-18-005,ORESU-Y-18-005,E/INT-151,theses/disserta​tions,2018,Oregon Sea Grant,"Spatiotemporal Distribution of the Anti-Diabetic Drug, Metformin, in the Lower Columbia River and Its Effect on Phytoplankton Growth",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study addresses this problem through the development of an emulator, or surrogate model, which replaces the simulator (in this case the coupled ADCIRC+SWAN model) with a statistical representation ​ that is able to rapidly predict estuarine variables relevant to flooding. Emulation of water levels (WLs), non-tidal residual, and significant wave height, is explored at Grays Harbor, Washington (WA) USA using Gaussian process regression. The effectiveness of the methodology is validated at various model simplification levels to determine where error is being sourced. Emulated WLs are found to be skillful when compared to over a decade of tide gauge observations (root mean square error, RMSE,<15 cm). The largest loss of skill in the method originates with ADCIRC+SWAN attempting to reproduce observations, even when the majority of relevant physics are included. Subsequent simplifications​ to the simulator (input reduction techniques) and the emulator itself are found to introduce a trivial amount of error (average increase in RMSE of 1 cm). Emulated WLs are also compared to spatially varying observations and found to be equally skillful throughout the estuary. An example emulation application is explored by decomposing the relative forcing contributions to extreme WLs across the study site. Results show a compound nature of extreme estuarine WLs in that all forcing dimensions contribute to extremes, with streamflow having the least influence and tides the largest. Overall the approach is shown to be both skillful and efficient at reproducing critical hydrodynamic variables, suggesting that emulation may play a key role in improving our ability to probabilistical​ly assess flood risk in complex environments as well as being promising in a range of other applications.","Parker, Kai;Ruggiero, Peter;Serafin, Katherine A.;Hill, David F.",ORESU-R-19-007,ORESU-R-19-007,E/INT-143 E/A-16,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Oregon Sea Grant,Emulation as an approach for rapid estuarine modeling,NA,NA,"Coastal Engineering, 150:79-93, August 2019",NA,10.1016/j.coast​aleng.2019.03.0​04,Elsevier,NA

The paper discusses management implications and conservation planning. 1. Globally, river systems have been extensively modified through alterations in riverscapes and flow regimes, reducing their capacity to absorb geophysical and environmental changes. 2. In western North America and elsewhere, alterations in natural flow regimes and swimways through dams, levees, and floodplain development, work in concert with fire regime, forest management practices, as well as agriculture and urban development, to change recovery trajectories of river systems. 3. Hydroregime scenarios for coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch (Walbaum, 1792), were investigated in Washington and Oregon, USA, where long‐term records of discharge, water temperature, and upstream fish passage are available. This novel approach combines hydrological and ecological data in a single visualization, providing empirical foundations for understanding upstream behavioural movement and tolerances of native fishes. 4. The timing of coho salmon movement with respect to temperature and discharge were compared with scenarios representing possible future hydrological conditions associated with a changing climate. 5. This approach provides a framework for the study of future hydrological alterations in other locations, and can inform local and regional conservation planning, particularly in view of water management policy. Management implications and recommendations for action that may expand the capacity of riverscapes to absorb perturbations are discussed.","Flitcroft, Rebecca;Lewis, Sarah;Arismendi, Ivan;Davis, Chante;Giannico, Guillermo;Penaluna, Brooke;Santelmann, Mary;Safeeq, Mohammad;Snyder, Jeff",ORESU-R-19-008,ORESU-R-19-008,A/E/C OED 2018-21,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Oregon Sea Grant,Using expressed behaviour of Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to evaluate the vulnerability of upriver migrants under future hydrological regimes: Management implications and conservation planning,NA,NA,"Aquatic Conservation: Marine Freshwater Ecosystems, pp. 1-12, 2019; https://doi.org​/10.1002/aqc.30​14",NA,10.1002/aqc.301​4,Wiley,NA

Lesson 1 begins by exploring a real-life story of the near collapse of the oyster industry that occurred from 2007 to 2009 along the U.S. west coast. The lesson continues with an overview of OA and exploration of how humans have altered the carbon cycle. Lessons 2 and 3 focus on the chemistry of OA. In Lesson 2, students focus on pH and how carbon dioxide “acidifies” water. In Lesson 3, students learn about changes in carbonate ion concentration, something important to calcifying marine organisms that make shells and hard structures out of calcium carbonate (for example, shellfish and corals). Students apply their learning by interpreting water quality data from Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery. In Lesson 4, students research the possible impacts of OA to ecosystems and humans. In Lesson 5, students examine possible solutions to OA by brainstorming ways to reduce CO2 emissions, identifying barriers to taking action, and exploring which household actions have the greatest potential impact. A recommended culminating Call to Action project has students identify a target audience and try to persuade their chosen audience to take action.","Erickson, Brian;Crews, Tracy;Lewis, Heidi",ORESU-E-19-002,ORESU-E-19-002,A/E/C-OED 2018-21,educational materials,2019,Oregon Sea Grant,"Changing Ocean Chemistry: A high school curriculum on ocean acidification's cause, impacts, and solutions",NA,NA,NA,"Cooper, Rick",NA,NA,NA18OAR4170072

Despite this, extreme water levels are typically modeled in isolated open coast or estuarine environments, potentially mischaracterizi​ng the true risk of flooding facing coastal communities. This paper explores the variability of extreme water levels near the tribal community of La Push, within the Quileute Indian Reservation on the Washington state coast, where a river signal is apparent in tide gauge measurements during high discharge events. To estimate the influence of multiple forcings on high water levels a hybrid modeling framework is developed, where probabilistic simulations of joint still water level and river discharge occurrences are merged with a hydraulic model that simulates along-river water levels. This methodology produces along-river water levels from thousands of combinations of events not necessarily captured in the observational records. We show that the 100-year still water level event and the 100-year discharge event do not always produce the 100-year along-river water level. Furthermore, along specific sections of river, both still water level and discharge are necessary for producing the 100-year along river water level. Understanding the relative forcing driving extreme water levels along an ocean-to-river gradient will help communities within inlets better understand their risk to the compounding impacts of various environmental forcing, which is important for increasing their resilience to future flooding events.","Serafin, Katherine A.;Ruggiero, Peter;Parker, Kai;Hill, David F.",ORESU-R-19-009,ORESU-R-19-009,E/INT-143 E/A-16,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Oregon Sea Grant,What's streamflow got to do with it?

Understanding the motivations of adults to join and remain active in citizen science programs is important as the diversity and abundance of opportunities for public participation in science grow. We conducted a mixed-methods study of newly recruited and “seasoned” (1 year plus) participants in the Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team, a hands-on, environmental citizen science program focused on adult coastal residents, to explore the degree to which engagement, measured as time in the program, influenced motivation. We used constructs of functionalism, person-object theory of interest, and activity theoretic approaches to situational identity to deconstruct motivation into three interacting components: objects of interest, actions directed toward those objects, and situated senses of self. Newly recruited participants came with a strong interest in being outside on the beach and learning about birds and saw themselves as data collectors defined in part by their birding and degree/job-​based credentials and their social relationships. By contrast, seasoned participants aligned their interests and situational identity more directly with the program, calling out the importance of program data and results, elevating science-based actions such as monitoring over learning, intensifying their desire to contribute to science, subjugating individual attributes in favor of their science identity, and increasing their sense of self-worth attached to the project. Our results suggest that hands-on, environmental citizen science programs focused on adults should shape their data collector roles and projects around context-​specific motivations including senses of place and biodiversity, support both the altruistic and self-interest needs of participants, and combine rigorous science experience with social interaction.","He, Yurong;Parrish, Julia K.;Rowe, Shawn;Jones, Timothy",ORESU-R-19-010,ORESU-R-19-010,R/IEd-14;R/RCE-9,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Oregon Sea Grant,Evolving interest and sense of self in an environmental citizen science program,Open access under license by the Resilience Alliance,NA,"Ecology and Society, 24(2):33, 2019",NA,10.5751/ES-​10956-​240233,NA,NA270R

Many studies have focused on the physiological challenges experienced by young oyster larvae in high pCO2/low pH seawater with reduced aragonite saturation state (Ωarag), which is characteristic of OA. Relatively few, by contrast, have evaluated these impacts upon fitness traits across multiple larval stages and between discrete oyster populations. In this study, we conducted 2 replicated experiments, in 2015 and 2016, using larvae from naturalized ‘wild’ and selectively bred stocks of the Pacific oyster Crasso - strea gigas from the US Pacific Northwest and reared them in ambient (~400 µatm) or high (~1600 µatm) pCO2 seawater from fertilization through final metamorphosis to juvenile ‘spat.’ In each year, high pCO2 seawater inhibited early larval development and affected the timing, but not the magnitude, of mortality during this stage. The effects of acidified seawater on metamorphosis of pediveligers to spat were variable between years, with no effect of seawater pCO2 in the first experiment but a ~42% reduction in spat in the second. Despite this variability, larvae from selectively bred oysters produced, on average, more (+ 55 and 37%) and larger (+ 5 and 23%) spat in ambient and high pCO2 seawater, respectively. These findings highlight the variable and stage-​specific sensitivity of larval oysters to acidified seawater and the influence that genetic factors have in determining the larval performance of C. gigas exposed to high pCO2 seawater.","Durland, Evan;Waldbusser, George;Langdon, Chris",ORESU-R-19-012,ORESU-R-19-012,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Oregon Sea Grant,Comparison of larval development in domesticated and naturalized stocks of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas exposed to high pCO2 conditions,Open access,NA,"Marine Ecology Progress Series, Vol. 621:107-125, July 4, 2019",NA,10.3354/meps129​83,NA,NA14OAR4170064

A large data set including thousands of excerpts of video-taped activity was analyzed using collaborative, online, qualitative data analysis software (Dedoose). The results suggest that the type of mediation overrides the design of the exhibition when it comes to children visitors’ experiences and that, despite their emphasis on promoting visitor engagement, explainer mediation strategies often represented deficit and banking models of teaching and learning, highlighting the importance of training for explainers that goes beyond content training and focuses on strategies of mediation that promote learner agency and protagonism.

Here, we discuss the potential links between three common management strategies (i.e., spatial restrictions such as marine protected areas, coordinated spatial protections, and fisheries management approaches) and potential mechanisms of resilience for marine populations and ecosystems, and provide guidance for future research on resilience management for a changing ocean drawing on insight gained by the Partnership for Interdisciplina​ry Studies of Coastal Oceans’ work at the science-policy interface in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem.","Kroeker, Kristy J.;Carr, Mark H.;Raimondi, Peter T.;Caselle, Jennifer E.;Washburn, Libe;Palumbi, Stephen R.;Barth, John A.;Chan, Francis;Menge, Bruce A.;Milligan, Kristen;Novak, Mark;White, J.

These nearshore regions also provide habitats vital to early life history stages of commercial non-whiting groundfish species, which supplied 21% of the Oregon fishing economy in 2018. The very shallow portions of the Oregon Coast (the area of the shelf inshore of ~30fm (180 ft. or 55m) have been the subject of little to no scientific survey monitoring, and much of the details of the ecology, health and processes in these habitats remain poorly understood. Furthermore, while the activity of the offshore Pacific Whiting (Merluccius productus) fleet and deeper water demersal fisheries have remained more consistent from 1976-present, the nearshore sector (which for the purposes of this thesis is defined as the region of shelf extending seaward to a water depth of 110 fathoms (200 meters or 660 feet)), has become increasingly underutilized by the Oregon commercial groundfish trawl fleet. This thesis assesses the potential for a more comprehensive reconstruction and understanding of broad-timescale trawl effort in the Oregon nearshore to be extracted from the combined knowledge of the commercial fishing community, fisheries managers, and fisheries scientists. By better defining what has impacted Oregon’s small nearshore fleet members, this thesis explores whether the collective experiences of fishermen in the nearshore sector through time may contribute local ecological knowledge (LEK) to lesser-studied groundfish fishery habitats in Oregon. Fisheries-​dependent data were collected in the form of commercial trawl logbooks, fish-ticket landings, and industry interviews and assessed using mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Results expose the nearshore sector of Oregon’s groundfish trawl fishery as a niche fishery recovering from a 20-year period of management reform and fisheries rebuilding. Less tangibly, it recognizes the self-contained identity of a small, specialized subset of the broader Oregon groundfish trawl fleet, whose endemic knowledge and experiences of the nearshore shelf prove valuable to reconstructing the history and social-​constructs of the unique nearshore ecosystem. The experiential knowledge and consistency in exposure of the nearshore groundfish trawl fleet offer a detailed and long-standing record of the drivers and health of the groundfish fishery both spatially and temporally. Findings from this research provide an opportunity to utilize LEK to augment scientific ecological knowledge (SEK). Adopting the LEK and contacts established within the Oregon nearshore groundfish fleet from this thesis establishes a baseline for ongoing conversations, cooperation and prospective collaboration among scientists, fisheries managers and fishermen moving forward.","Sjostrom, Anja J.

Resource management agencies and environmental organizations are working to protect and enhance remaining populations, but in many locations, information to characterize the current geospatial distribution of Olympia oysters is lacking. Advances in mapping technology and increased availability of geospatial, ecological data allow for more effective tracking and monitoring of Olympia oysters, which can support protection efforts. However, resource management agencies often face financial and staffing constraints that limit their ability to inventory the species across its range. Habitat Suitability Modeling (HSM) provides a promising approach for making predictions about the geospatial distribution of wild Olympia oyster populations by understanding and analyzing the physical environmental variables that influence its specific habitat. This project evaluates the use of an HSM, developed using geospatial raster layers of salinity, substrate, and elevation, in Yaquina Bay, Oregon to predict locations of Olympia oyster presence. This study was unable to make a conclusive determination regarding the predictive capacity of the HSM due to a small number of field samples. Recommendations are provided for expanding the HSM and supporting several other management applications, including characterizing the abiotic and biotic attributes of the habitat occupied by Olympia oysters and identifying biological monitoring sites.","Bohlen, Victoria",ORESU-Y-19-003,ORESU-Y-19-003,NB270Q,theses/disserta​tions,2019,Oregon Sea Grant,"Evaluation of a Habitat Suitability Model to predict the geospatial distribution of Olympia oyster presence in Yaquina Bay, Oregon",Master of Science in Marine Resource Management,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These restrictions were necessary to reduce fishing mortality on what were deemed to be overfished stocks. A multi-market approach is used to estimate consumer welfare changes in swordfish and tuna markets as both markets adjust to changes in swordfish management. The results of this analysis are compared and contrasted with that of a partial equilibrium approach in which market prices of substitute species are held constant. The study findings indicate that the partial equilibrium approach ignores the price effects of market interactions and results in incomplete analysis of fishery management policy.","Thunberg, Eric;Seale, James L.

Microplastics are pollutants of increasing concern. They are pervasive in the environment and can harbor or adsorb pollutants from surrounding waters. Aquatic organisms, including commercial species, encounter and ingest microplastics, but there is a scarcity of data about those caught and cultured in North America. Additional research is  needed to determine the prevalence, physiological effects, and population-​level implications of microplastics in commercial species from Canada, the United States and Mexico. Investigations into possible human health effects of microplastic exposure from seafood are also greatly needed. Researchers summarize the current knowledge, identify data gaps, and provide future research directions for addressing microplastics effects in commercially valuable North American fishery species.;Scientific Significance Statement: As global seafood consumption rises, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which fisheries are affected by microplastic pollution. A growing body of literature describes the occurrence and effects of microplastics in commercial species, primarily from Europe, Asia, and South America; however, there are far fewer studies conducted in North America. In this article, we review the evidence available for the presence and effects of microplastics on commercially valuable fishery species of North America and possible consequences of human consumption.

Regions within an estuary differ with respect to salinity, temperature, oxygen, and organic inputs, highlighting the complexity of nursery habitat and the need to assess multiple habitats within a single  estuary. To determine the effect of variable estuarine habitat on juvenile English sole, researchers examined morphometric and energetic (lipid) condition, fatty acids, and stable isotopes (13C and 15N) of wild-caught juveniles from upriver and downriver habitats within the Yaquina Bay, Oregon estuary. Downriver-​caught fish exhibited higher energetic conditions, which may be attributed to cooler temperatures and  the marine-sourced carbon that typified that region’s food web. Conversely, individuals from the upriver habitat exhibited higher morphometric conditions. This may be due in part to the warmer temperatures upriver that have been observed to promote growth and suppress lipid storage in other marine species. These findings highlight  the important but variable contribution of both upriver and downriver habitats to English sole early life history.","Stowell, Michel​le A.;Copeman, Louise A.;Ciannelli, Lorenzo",ORESU-R-19-020,ORESU-R-19-020,R/RCF-​37-​Ciannelli1820,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Oregon Sea Grant,Variability in Juvenile English Sole Condition Relative to Temperature and Trophic Dynamics Along an Oregon Estuarine Gradient,NA,NA,"Estuaries and Coasts, 42:1955-1968, 2019",NA,10.1007/s12237-​019-​00621-​2,Springer,NA

The bagged and rafted-line shells were deployed in July 2017, and were sampled monthly until June 2018; the loose shells were deployed by the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians (CTSI) in April 2017 and were sampled twice during the study period. This study also quantified the size-specific fecundity and sex ratios of adult Olympia oysters by sampling 30 to 31 oysters every two weeks between April and June 2018 from a subtidal site 1 km downriver from the shell treatment sites. 	Per 100 shells, the bagged shells captured one to two orders of magnitude more juvenile Olympia oysters than either the loose or rafted-line shells. There were no significant differences in growth or mortality among the three shell treatments, but the significantly lower abundance on the loose and rafted-line shells may affect the population structure in later life stages in future generations of Olympia oysters. 	Brooders were first found in late May, with average brood sizes of 339,000. Brood size was significantly positively correlated to shell height (R2 = 0.719), suggesting that Olympia oyster fecundity increases with body size. The male ratio increased over the course of the spawning  season, which may be related to the depletion of lipid and metabolic reserves required for oogenesis after the initial spawn of the season (Abad et al., 1995; Joyce et al., 2013). 	The results of this study may inform future restoration efforts in Yaquina Bay, and fill regional knowledge gaps of the current status of remnant Olympia oyster populations.

Here we use descriptive Bayesian network analyses to examine how sediment supply, beach characteristics​, and two species of beachgrass (Ammophila arenaria and Ammophila breviligulata) alter foredune morphology and patterns of sand accretion on U.S. Pacific Northwest foredunes. We show that sediment supply and beach type primarily determine foredune morphology. Beachgrass density also influences foredune shape, but its effects differ among species: increasing density of A. arenaria was associated with steeper sloping dunes, whereas increasing density of A. breviligulata was associated with wider, more shallow sloping dunes. An examination of the change in foredune morphology over a 2‐year period found sand accretion was most strongly influenced by species‐specifi​c patterns of vegetation growth and beach type. Specifically, A. breviligulata exhibited more lateral growth, resulting in greater sand accretion at the seaward margin of the foredune. In contrast, A. arenaria exhibited little lateral growth, resulting in comparatively more sand accretion near the foredune crest. Consequently, growth form‐generated sand accretion patterns resulted in steep, narrow A. arenaria‐domina​ted foredunes and shallow‐sloping​, wider A. breviligulata‐d​ominated foredunes. These results illustrate that vegetation density and patterns of growth influence foredune morphology and its changes over time.","Biel, R.G.;Hacker, S.D.;Ruggiero, P.",ORESU-R-19-023,ORESU-R-19-023,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Oregon Sea Grant,Elucidating Coastal Foredune Ecomorphodynami​cs in the U.S. Pacific Northwest via Bayesian Networks,NA,NA,"Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface, 124:1919-1938, 2019",NA,10.1029/2018JF0​04758,American Geophysical Union (AGU),NA14OAR4170064;NA15OAR4310243

The coastal waters of southern New England are heavily used, especially during the summer months when fishers on small boats and large vessels seek to use the same waters. The intensive use of nearshore (also known as inshore) waters often results in conflicts among vessels and their gear. The small boats include recreational fishers and commercial rod and reel fishers who cannot run long distances or work through rough weather or 24-hour days like the larger commercial fleet, while larger vessels may use a variety of mobile gear, including midwater and bottom trawls and gillnets. This study identifies state limits on the use of area closures to manage coastal waters to avoid conflict. It focuses on gear restrictions in Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Rhode Island. Part One provides an overview of state nearshore restricted fishing areas. Part Two provides evidence and reasoning for why the government has an interest in regulating certain types of gear in nearshore areas. Part Three provides a general overview of the gear restriction models each state has in place. Part Four examines the seasonal restrictions applied to certain types of gear.

These ecological subsidies can have substantial effects on community structure, function, and services, especially when the connections are between communities with contrasting productivity. At the ocean-land interface, low productivity coastal beaches and dunes are regularly exposed to subsidies from the ocean. These marine subsidies likely provide an important nutrient source for dune vegetation that might otherwise be nutrient-​limited. Given that dune vegetation plays a key role in dune formation and stabilization, it is imperative to understand the role of marine subsidies to the nutrient dynamics and plant productivity patterns of these coastal systems. In this dissertation, I investigate the role of marine subsidies to dune  ecosystem functions from local to meta-ecosystem scales along the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast. Coastal beaches and dunes make up approximately  45% of the Oregon and Washington coasts and are adjacent to many highly  productive estuaries and rocky reefs. The plant communities at these sites experience variable ocean productivity, marine subsidies, and coastal sediment supply. The most common plant species are two non-native invasive grasses, the European beachgrass, Ammophila arenaria, and the American beachgrass, Ammophila breviligulata. Since their introduction in the early 1900’s, the Ammophila congeners have spread and rapidly transformed what was once an open, shifting, and sparsely vegetated habitat into one with continuous, stable, and densely  vegetated foredunes. Despite this ecosystem-level transformation over the last century, little is known about the role of marine subsidies to the nutrient dynamics and primary production of dune grass communities. Here I use a combination of observations, laboratory analyses, and experiments to understand the role of ecological subsidies to dune grass  production at local to regional scales along the U.S. Pacific Northwest  coast. In Chapter 2, I explore the role of marine subsidies to dune grass production at 15 dune-backed beach sites in Washington and Oregon and over three years (2015-2017). Specifically, I ask 1) Is there a relationship between ocean upwelling, distance to wrack source habitat, and beach width to macrophyte wrack amount and composition across large regional (meta-​ecosystem) spatial scales and over time (2015-2017)?, 2) Is there a relationship between ocean upwelling, sand supply, and/or marine macrophyte wrack and the marine nutrient dynamics at local and regional scales and over time?, and 3) Is there a relationship between marine nutrients and dune grass production at local to regional spatial scales and over time? I provide evidence that marine subsidies are common and predictable sources of nutrients to these beaches and dunes and that they influence dune grass ecosystems in significant ways. Specifically, I found that macrophyte wrack and sand nitrates, which were positively related to ocean upwelling and sand supply, were important determinants of dune grass production across sites and foredune profile locations. Beaches with more macrophyte wrack and greater sand supply had greater dune grass shoot density and biomass, especially at the toe of the dune where sand nitrate concentrations were  high. Beaches with lower macrophyte wrack and sand supply had greater shoot density and biomass of dune grasses at the crest of the dune, where sand deposition and nitrate concentrations were high. Taken together, these results suggest that marine subsidies are important contributors to the nutrient dynamics and productivity of dune grasses, potentially influencing the sand capture and dune building capabilities of these ecosystem engineering grass species. In Chapter 3, I determine whether dune plant species in the U.S. Pacific Northwest use marine subsidies, and if so, how this use varies at local to regional spatial scales. In particular, I ask 1) Does the amount (%N) and marine source (δ15N) of nitrogen in four dune plant species (two non-native invasive beachgrass species Ammophila arenaria and A. breviligulata, the native dune grass, Elymus mollis, and the native shrub Cakile edentula) vary across sites (coast-scale) and foredune profile locations (dune-scale)? and 2) Does the amount (%N) and marine source (δ15N) of nitrogen of beachgrasses correlate with measures of marine subsidies (macrophyte wrack and sand nitrates) and/or beach and foredune geomorphology (beach width and foredune crest height) on coastal foredunes? I found that marine nutrients were an important source of nitrogen for dune plants in  the U.S. Pacific Northwest, and that the amount and source of nitrogen in these plants varied among species, sites, and foredune profile locations. Regression analyses showed that, for the most part, macrophyte wrack biomass and sand nitrate concentrations were unrelated to %N or δ15N of the grasses. However, I did find that wider beaches and  shorter foredunes had beachgrasses with slightly lower %N tissue content across foredune profile locations but the source of that nitrogen at the crest and heel had a higher marine signature. The results presented in this chapter corroborate earlier studies that beach  nutrients, especially those with marine origin, are an important source  of nitrogen for foredune plants. Finally, in Chapter 4, I test whether beachgrasses in the U.S. Pacific Northwest are nutrient limited and whether this potential limitation varies along foredune profile locations and sites with different sand nitrate conditions. Specifically, I used two manipulative experiments to ask: (1) How does nutrient addition affect dune grass production at sites and foredune profile locations that vary in natural sand nitrate concentrations? and (2) Does dune grass production and plant tissue elemental composition vary with increasing nitrogen additions and do dune grasses experience nitrogen and phosphorous co-limitation? I found that dune grasses were nutrient-​limited, with nutrient additions positively affecting dune grass production at sites and foredune profile locations that have higher wrack deposition and background sand nitrate concentrations. I also found that increased nitrogen and phosphorous increased grass shoot  density, total biomass, and plant tissue %N. However, grass shoot biomass and shoot length either did not change, or declined, with phosphorus additions suggesting that there was no phosphorus co-​limitation. These results suggest that U.S. Pacific Northwest dune grasses are nutrient limited, especially at the foredune crest and heel,  where background sand nitrate concentrations are lower. In summary, my dissertation fills a critical gap in our understanding of beach and dune  nutrient dynamics and the role of nutrients to coastal dune plant community production from a meta-ecosystem perspective. By considering local and regional relationships, this meta-ecosystem approach provides an ideal framework to understanding the role of marine subsidies to dune  grass production. This approach also allows us to better understand how  coastal dune systems might change under varying climate so that we may better manage their functions and services in the future.","Constant, Vanessa",ORESU-Y-19-004,ORESU-Y-19-004,NA,theses/disserta​tions,2019,Oregon Sea Grant,Coastal Dunes as Meta-​Ecosystems: Connecting Marine Subsidies to Dune Ecosystem Functions on the U.S. Pacific Northwest Coast,"This thesis was for a doctorate in Integrative Biology at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon",https://ir.libr​ary.oregonstate​.edu/concern/gr​aduate_thesis_o​r_dissertations​/q524jv90x?loca​le=en,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA14OAR4170064

The ability of animals to assess their position in the marine environment is an essential aspect of migratory life-histories, as it allows them to target potentially distant habitats that optimize growth and survival for a given life-stage, while still allowing them to return to previous locations that are more favorable for their offspring. For early life-stages, water currents dominate movement and because spawning typically occurs at particular sites where conditions facilitate juvenile dispersal, compass cues are sufficient to direct their journey. As fish age, swimming behavior becomes of equal importance to ocean currents and map cues are used to localize oceanic foraging grounds. For fish to return to their natal site to spawn, swimming behavior dominates movement and map cuesare required for homing.","Putman, Nathan F.;Ueda, Hiroshi;Noakes, David L.

However, due to a lack of applicable, federal regulation, states are left to determine how to regulate the sale of whole-form seaweed through their own statutes and administrative regulations, which  vary widely in scope, content, and applicability. Consequently, it is necessary to understand the differing elements of such state rules, as they can greatly impact the potential success of a commercial seaweed aquaculture operation. In response to this need, the National Sea Grant Law Center (NSGLC) conducted an inventory of applicable statutes and regulations in states that either currently permit commercial seaweed aquaculture or have taken steps to facilitate such in the future. In creating this report, the National Sea Grant Law Center identified eleven states with potentially applicable statutes and regulations—Ala​ska, California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington.

This report does not list every potentially applicable rule, but instead includes those most relevant due to their scope, content, and/or applicability.

For sea turtles, nesting beach surveys are often the only population-​level surveys that are accessible. However, process and observation errors, compounded by delayed maturity, obscure the relationship between trends on the nesting beach and the population. We present a simulation-​based tool, monitoring strategy evaluation (MoSE), to test the relationships between monitoring data and assessment accuracy, using green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, as a case study. To explore this first application of MoSE, we apply different treatments of population impacts to virtual true populations, and sample the nests or nesters, with observation error, to test if the observation data can be used to diagnose population status accurately. Based on the observed data, we examine population trend and compare it to the known values from the operating model. We ran a series of scenarios including harvest impacts, cyclical breeding probability, and sampling biases, to see how these factors impact accuracy in estimating population trend. We explored the necessary duration of monitoring for accurate trend estimation and the probability of a false trend diagnosis. Our results suggest that disturbance type and severity can have important and persistent effects on the accuracy of population assessments drawn from monitoring nesting beaches. The underlying population phase, age classes disturbed, and impact severity influenced the accuracy of estimating population trend. At least 10 yr of monitoring data is necessary to estimate population trend accurately, and >20 yr if juvenile age classes were disturbed and the population is recovering. In general, there is a greater probability of making a false positive trend diagnosis than a false negative, but this depends on impact type and severity, population phase, and sampling duration. Improving detection rates to 90% does little to lower probability of a false trend diagnosis with shorter monitoring spans. Altogether, monitoring strategies for specific populations may be tailored based on the impact history, population phase, and environmental drivers. The MoSE is an important framework for analysis through simulation that can comprehensively test population assessments for accuracy and inform policy recommendations regarding the best monitoring strategies.","Piacenza, Susan E.;Richards, Paul M.;Heppell, Selina S.",ORESU-R-19-025,ORESU-R-19-025,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Oregon Sea Grant,Fathoming sea turtles: monitoring strategy evaluation to improve conservation status assessments,Open access,NA,"Ecological Applications, 29(6):1299-​1315, Article e01942, September 2019",NA,10.1002/eap.194​2,Oregon Sea Grant,NA

Here, a genotypingby-​sequencing (GBS) approach was used to examine genomic variation in an early lifestage (megalopae) of the Dungeness crab (Cancer magister), which constitutes the most valuable single-species commercial fishery in the CCE. Variation in abundance and timing of megalopae recruitment has been extensively studied for over two decades in Coos Bay, Oregon, United States. Within the CCE, documented timing of Dungeness crab life history events indicates that coastal megalopae recruitment is expected to occur April through July; however, long-term studies in Coos Bay have observed late-season recruitment from August to October. Based on variation at 1,913 presumably neutral loci, evidence was found for weak, yet significant differentiation (FSTestimate = 0.0011) between the 2014 expected-season recruits (n = 47) and late season recruits (n = 47) collected in Coos Bay. However, two putatively adaptive loci with a high FST estimate (0.2036) between expected-season and late-season recruits were identified. These findings support the hypothesis that expected-season and late season megalopae recruiting to Coos Bay within the same year may have originatedfrom different locations or from different breeding groups. Understanding marine species connectivity between ecosystems is important when considering how future changes inocean conditions may impact fishery harvests.","Lee, Elizabeth M.J.;O'Malley, Kathleen G.",ORESU-R-20-002,ORESU-R-20-002,E/INT-157,reprints (peer-reviewed),2020,Oregon Sea Grant,"Big Fishery, Big Data, and Little Crabs: Using Genomic Methods to Examine the Seasonal Recruitment Patterns of Early Life Stage Dungeness Crab (Cancer Magister) in the California Current Ecosystem",Open access article,NA,"Frontiers in Marine Science, 6: Article 836, January 22, 2020",NA,10.3389/fmars.2​019.00836,NA,NA14OAR4170064

Whale body condition can be used to monitor foraging success, and thus better understand and anticipate individual- and population-​level trends in reproduction and survival. We assessed the body condition of eastern North Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) on their foraging grounds along the Oregon coast, USA, from June to October of three consecutive years (2016–2018). We used drone photogrammetry and applied the body area index (BAI) to measure and compare whale body condition, which is a continuous, unitless metric similar to the body mass index inhumans. A total of 289 drone flights were carried out over 106 photo-​identified whales, which were grouped into demographic units by sex, maturity, and female reproductive status. Calves and pregnant females displayed the highest BAIs, followed by resting females, mature males, and, finally, lactating females, reflecting the significant energetic demands on reproductive females. In all three years, gray whale body condition improved with the progression of feeding seasons, demonstrating the accumulation of body energy reserves on the foraging grounds. Yet, body condition was significantly better in 2016 than in 2017 and 2018 when overall body depletion was observed, indicating a difference in prey availability and/or quality between years. We analyzed local upwelling patterns between 2013 and 2018 as an oceanographic proxy for prey and determined significantly greater upwelling between 2013 and 2015 than low upwelling years between 2016 and 2018. We hypothesize that these upwelling patterns created ecosystem shifts in primary productivity and zooplankton prey of gray whales, causing carry-over effects between foraging success and body conditionin subsequent years. This study demonstrates the value of monitoring whale body condition to better understand temporal variation in foraging success, and potentially detect and describe the causes of anomalous changes in whale population health, such as the 2019 gray whale mortality event.","Lemos, Leila Soledade;Burnett, Jonathan D.;Chandler, Todd E.;Sumich, James L.;Torres, Leigh G.",ORESU-R-20-003,ORESU-R-20-003,R/ECO-40-PD,reprints (peer-reviewed),2020,Oregon Sea Grant,Intra- and inter-annual variation in gray whale body condition on a foraging ground,Open access,NA,"Ecosphere, 11 (4): Article e03094, April 2020; accepted January 2020",NA,10.1002/ecs2.30​94,NA,NA18OAR4170072

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/22588314_3212_2816226.csv,128,"Introduction: Overfishing and overcapitalizat​ion have been prominent challenges in the West Coast Groundfish fishery as managers strive to maintain a viable, profitable, and efficient groundfish fishery (Pacific Fishery Management Council and NMFS 2010). The fishery spans the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington and includes about 90 species, many of which are long- lived, slow-growing, and late-to-mature. Management is complicated by multiple species living in the same areas, so that reducing catch limits of one species will indirectly limit catches of another species. Selectively targeting a species is particularly difficult with trawl gear. Taken together, these factors pose challenges to managers who strive to prevent overfishing of all species and reduce excess fishing capacity while maintaining an economically viable fishery.Overfis​hing occurred throughout much of the fishery’s history due to harvest targets that were set too high, further exacerbated by the short data series available for analysis and assessment following the rapid build up in many of these fisheries, relative to life histories of many rockfish (Sebastes spp.) that can live for many decades (Love et al. 1987; Cailliet et al. 2001). At that time, rockfish were thought to be shorter lived and more productive than they are in reality, and as a result, fishing mortality rates were set at unsustainable levels. Assessments in the mid-1990s found that some stocks were below 20% of unfished biomass (Ralston 2011), far below the target levels which were based on spawning potential ratios below 35% (Clark 1991) and then updated to 40% (Clark 1993). Target harvest rates were reduced, and landings declined to the point that the fishery was declared an economic disaster in 2000 (Shaw and Conway 2007; Hilborn et al. 2012). In 2002, the PFMC specified rebuilding plans for overfished species and greatly reduced target fishing mortality rates to as low as 0.8% for Pacific ocean perch (Pacific2 Fishery Management Council 2014). Rebuilding plans have been effective for most species, andseven of ten stocks have been declared rebuilt.;Abstract: Hook-and-line surveys can be used to estimate trends in the many fish species where more conventional methods such as trawl, acoustic, visual, or pot surveys cannot be applied. Hook-​and-​line surveys allow the collection of biological information including length, weight, age, and sexual maturity, but there are concerns about hook saturation, survey design, and the impact of competition among species on survey abundance estimates. We designed simulations to address these concerns and found hyperstability across all scenarios: catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined more slowly than population size. Despite hyperstability, the surveys still had statistical power to detect changes in abundance. Preferentially selecting sites with the most fish for survey sampling resulted in 45% stronger hyperstability but also a greater ability to detect changes in population size. When fish are distributed patchily, resulting in the most hyperstability,​ a decrease in relative abundance from 50% to 10% resulted in median CPUE values declining 28-35% when sampling preferentially and 11-12% when sampling randomly. Interspecies competition for hooks resulted in biased survey results when one species was more aggressive than another. Taken together, hook-and-line surveys offer a promising technique for species unsuited for other survey types.","Kuriyama, Peter T.",WASHU-Y-18-002,WSG-TH 19-03,R/E/1-23,theses/disserta​tions,2018,Washington Sea Grant,Multispecies Management and Assessment in the US West Coast Groundfish Fishery,"For the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, University of Washington",https://digital​.lib.washington​.edu/researchwo​rks/bitstream/h​andle/1773/4179​4/Kuriyama_wash​ington_0250E_18​231.pdf?sequenc​e=1&isAllowed=y​,NA,NA,NA,Washington Sea Grant,NA

Using post matching regressions and accounting for potential spillovers, we find evidence that the value of the erosion protection option is between 13% and 22% of land price for parcels vulnerable to coastal hazards, implying that owners of ocean front parcels have a subjective annual probability that they will experience an irreversible loss absent the option to protect between 0.7% and 1.3%.

Flooding events caused by sea-level rise and climate change are expected to increase in frequency and severity in the future, creating social, ecological, and economic problems at local, city, state, and federal levels. It is clear that normative, infrastructure-​oriented, and strictly hydrological solutions to flooding have not appropriately met these challenges, nor have they adequately addressed relevant sociopolitical factors which shape hydrological processes. Using the case study of Tillamook County, this study draws upon qualitative interview data to identify and explain social factors which have influenced the outcome of a collaborative, socially engaged flood management project. These include previous flood experience; emotions and feelings; interests and concerns; preferred management strategies; barriers to community-​scientific engagement; and perceptions of a mediation process. This situation is further explored within the framework of social geometry, which is used to explain changes in social  position and relationships through an interactive, collaborative process. In this case, mediation is shown to decrease both relational space and differences in status between the two primary actor groups, leading to mutually agreeable outcomes but not without dispute.

Here, we used a genotyping-​by-​sequencing (GBS) approach to examine fine-scale spatial and temporal genomic variation among Dungeness crab Cancer magister larval recruits sampled in the California Current Ecosystem. Specifically, we compared samples collected during expected- and late-season recruitment time periods within 2 consecutive years (2017 and 2018) at2 sites in Oregon, USA (Yaquina Bay and Coos Bay). Evidence was found for high gene flow between the expected- and late-season recruits within each year and at both sites based on 1389neutral loci. In contrast, strong genetic differentiation was observed between these 2 groups within each year and at both sites based on variation at 2 putatively adaptive loci. Contrary to prediction, the magnitude of genetic differentiation between these 2 seasonal groups was greater in 2017 when the Pacific Decadal Oscillation was stronger, upwelling was weaker, and the springtransitio​n was later. Spatial genetic variation was not observed within 2017 or 2018. Comparing across years, expected- and late-season groups were differentiated at putatively adaptive loci. Interestingly, strong genetic differentiation was also observed between late-season groups across years. We found no evidence for cohesive larval dispersal among recruits based on genetic related ness estimates. Overall, our findings provide evidence for high connectivity within Dungeness crab, but suggest that selective pressures and ocean conditions influence the genetic composition of larval recruits both intra- and inter-annually.","Lee, Elizabeth M.

The native north-east Pacific ascidian Corella inflata Huntsman, 1912, has spread southward and invaded new regions along the North American Pacific coast, a rare example of a marine species moving towards the equator. Here, we document C. inflata's equatorward movement and potential impact, assess several hypotheses for its spread and consider implications for invasion ecology. Location: North American Pacific Coast (Puget Sound to San Francisco Bay). Methods: We recorded the southward movement of C. inflata by compiling records from the literature, conducting informal searches and conducting standardized fouling community surveys at sites from the southern border of C. inflata's native range in Puget Sound to San Francisco Bay. Within San Francisco Bay, we recorded C. inflata's arrival and potential impact by conducting standardized surveys across an 18-year period encompassing the invasion. Results: First collected outside its native range in Coos Bay, Oregon, in 2004, C. inflata was subsequently detected 1,000 km south of its historical distribution by 2008 in San Francisco and Humboldt Bays, California. At times, this large, conspicuous solitary ascidian became locally abundant in San Francisco Bay fouling communities, which showed significant shifts in species composition and relative abundance at invaded sites concomitant with C. inflata's arrival. Main conclusions: The recent southward movement of C. inflata runs counter to global warming expectations and may be linked to undetected changes in vessel traffic patterns, rather than natural range expansion. However, an understanding of the one or more processes that would serve to explain the equatorward movement of this cold-water affinity marine species remains elusive.","Chang, Andrew L.;Carlton, James T.;Brown, Christopher W.;Ruiz, Gregory M.",MDU-R-20-008,UM-​SG-​RS-​2020-​16,R/IS-17,reprints (peer-reviewed),2020,Maryland Sea Grant,Down the up staircase: Equatorward march of a cold-water ascidian and broader implications for invasion ecology,Open access article,NA,"Diversity and Distributions, 26(7):881-896, July 2020",NA,10.1111/ddi.130​55,"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",NA16RG2207

Understanding the data process in its entirety is now a vital skillset required across industry, government, and scientific disciplines. The newest ships in the U.S. Academic Research Fleet, the Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRVs), are being built with the aim to support data literacy through a forthcoming real-time data portal that is intended to foster outreach and engagement. Research for understanding how the new RCRVs may support data literacy occurred in two phases. The first phase research investigated the transfer of real-time oceanographic data from researchers to K-12 classrooms and “The Data Stream” was identified. The second phase of research, explained here, expanded upon the first phase through interviewing experts in the field of data literacy and shipboard education. In addition, specialists in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the geosciences were interviewed. The objective was to determine promising practices in data literacy education and shipboard outreach that are also culturally responsive. The expert interviews illuminated numerous educational strategies which may facilitate building a student’s data literacy. One prominent strategy is student-driven community action research, in which students collect and evaluate data to create local change. An eight-week after school program, Mar Adentro, was developed where students could examine the presence of microplastics in their local watershed. The pilot program was tested with seven students from Oregon’s Latina/o community. Students ultimately emerged from the program with a deeper understanding of the data process. The program also demonstrated the value of providing second-language students informal learning spaces where they can comfortably utilize linguistic capital and engage with one another in their first language.","Nolan, Hannah",ORESU-Y-20-001,ORESU-Y-20-001,A/E/C OED 2018-21,theses/disserta​tions,2020,Oregon Sea Grant,Democratizing the Data Stream: Creating an Equitable Transfer of Research Vessel Data from Scientist to Student,Masters of Science in Marine Resource Management at Oregon State University,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,NA

The industry has been an integral part of the identity of Coos County since the establishment of salmon canneries in the late 1800’s and has shifted over time due to changes in management, markets, environmental change, and the businesses in operation. Through qualitative semi-structured interviews, a mental mapping exercise, and the application of a sense of place lens, this research identified seafood processing workers’ and employers' senses of place mediated by their work in the industry in several distinct processing plants in the region. Through their labor such as crab meat shaking, fish fileting, or  quality control, workers describe a hyper-local sense of connection and  belonging to the biophysical marine environment as well as to their co-workers and the community in which the product is sold. Employers experience a temporally and spatially broader sense of place that gives them the ability to adapt to dynamic conditions and heightens the resiliency of the industry. Additionally, community service providers were interviewed to provide an external perspective on the industry. They emphasized community-wide challenges such a lack of public transportation and affordable housing; many of these challenges are pertinent to processing workers. In addition to its economic value, the sense of identity and culture cultivated through the industry was described by community service providers and echoed in the sentiments of  employers and workers, highlighting the seafood processing industry as a  non-material socio-cultural benefit in the region.","Johnson, Maria Renee",ORESU-Y-20-002,ORESU-Y-20-002,R/SF-​37-​Maldonado1820,theses/disserta​tions,2020,Oregon Sea Grant,"Connection to Community and Environment: How Work in the Seafood Processing Industry in Coos County, Oregon Creates a Sense of Place","Masters of Science, Marine Resource Management, Oregon State University",NA,NA,NA,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,NA
/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/22656564_387_2813401.csv,165,"The commercial groundfish fishing industry and groundfish research have a  long concurrent history of activity on the Oregon continental margin. Within the non-whiting groundfish fishery, the target species are primarily flatfishes, sablefish, lingcod, and rockfishes, though landings of each have fluctuated over time. Recent work shows that over the past two decades, fishing effort has shifted offshore likely due to implementation of gear regulations, area closures, and lower catch limits. Although federal fishery-independent surveys have been conducted  across most of the groundfish fishery’s depth range, data is limited by  years and seasons surveyed as well as absence of data in the shallowest  waters (<55 m). Fishery-dependent data covers those shallow waters and a broader temporal range, but at a coarse scale. Limitations in data  coverage combined with a historical focus on deep-water groundfishes has led to a gap in understanding of dynamics within the nearshore fishery, particularly regarding the influence of environmental factors on abundance and distribution. Through this thesis, I analyzed changes in spatiotemporal dynamics of the Oregon nearshore non-whiting groundfish trawl fishery and assessed gaps in each data source over the past four decades. Statistical modeling was used to elucidate distribution shifts in species as well as temporal changes in community composition. These analyses revealed how individual species’ distributions have geographically shifted over time, what environmental variables affect their spatial distribution, and how depth and habitat type strongly influence nearshore community composition. I found that physical shelf structure drives the distribution of certain groundfish assemblages in that there are separate groups associated with different habitat types and depth zones. Individual species had strong depth preferences grouped in either shallow (< 80 m, e.g., starry flounder and sand sole), midshelf (e.g., petrale sole and lingcod), or deep (>  120 m, e.g., Sebastes spp.) clusters, which explains the importance of bathymetry in groundfish assemblage composition. The large-scale climate  indices tested did not explain the variability in either individual species abundance or assemblages, while temperature and depth drove abundance for most groundfish populations. It is clear from the results of this study that there have been spatiotemporal changes in the nearshore groundfish populations and assemblages during the past four decades, and that temperature is influential for some species distributions. Portions of the shelf that have experienced anomalous hypoxic events over the last two decades exhibit reductions in presence of hypoxia-intolerant species (e.g., petrale sole and lingcod), while shallow-water species that tolerate warmer water as well as low dissolved oxygen concentrations (e.g., English sole and Pacific sanddab)  exhibit shoreward compressed distributions. Visualization of both fishery-independent and -dependent data allowed for a qualitative comparison of data coverage as well as an assessment of differences in species distribution when mapping each data set. I found that the earliest years of the NOAA surveys (1980 – 1998) have the most information gaps and had the highest potential to benefit from complementary use of fishery-dependent data for spatial and temporal analyses. This was largely due to (1) triennial rather than annual sampling and a transect-based design in the NOAA surveys, and (2) the larger spatial and temporal coverage of logbook data (inshore and latitudinal) during that period. Commonly caught species (e.g., Dover sole and petrale sole) had better spatial sampling coverage of their populations compared to species that live in shallow water and are less frequently targeted (e.g., starry flounder and sand sole). These analyses illuminate where knowledge gaps lie in both data types and how they complement one another, providing more context for future management of nearshore groundfishes.","Howard, Rebecca A.",ORESU-Y-20-003,ORESU-Y-20-003,R/RCF-​37-​Ciannelli1820,theses/disserta​tions,2020,Oregon Sea Grant,Change in Oregon’s Nearshore Groundfish Trawl Fishery: Perspectives from Science and Industry Data,"Masters of Science, Marine Resource Management, Oregon State University",NA,NA,NA,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,NA

In Europe, attempts to quantify river connectivity have been hampered by the absence of a harmonized barrier database. Here we show that there are at least 1.2 million instream barriers in 36 European countries (with a mean density of 0.74 barriers per kilometre), 68 percent of which are structures less than two metres in height that are often overlooked. Standardized walkover surveys along 2,715 kilometres of stream length for 147 rivers indicate that existing records underestimate barrier numbers by about 61 percent. The highest barrier densities occur in the heavily modified rivers of central Europe and the lowest barrier densities occur in the most remote, sparsely populated alpine areas. Across Europe, the main predictors of barrier density are agricultural pressure, density of river-road crossings, extent of surface water and elevation. Relatively unfragmented rivers are still found in the Balkans, the Baltic states and parts of Scandinavia and southern Europe, but these require urgent protection from proposed dam developments. Our findings could inform the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, which aims to reconnect 25,000 kilometres of Europe’s rivers by 2030, but achieving this will require a paradigm shift in river restoration that recognizes the widespread impacts caused by small barriers.","Belletti, Barbara;Garcia de Leaniz, Carlos;Jones, Joshua;Bizzi, Simone;Börger, Luca;Segura, Gilles;Castelletti, Andrea;van de Bund, Wouter;Aarestrup, Kim;Barry, James;Belka, Kamila;Berkhuysen, Arjan;Birnie-Gauvin, Kim;Bussettini, Martina;Carolli, Mauro;Consuegra, Sofia;Dopico, Eduardo;Feierfeil, Tim;Fernández, Sara;Fernandez Garrido, Pao;Garcia-Vazquez, Eva;Garrido, Sara;Giannico, Guillermo;Gough, Peter;Jepsen, Niels;Jones, Peter E.;Kemp, Paul;Kerr, Jim;King, James;Łapińska, Małgorzata;Lázaro, Gloria;Lucas, Martyn C.;Marcello, Lucio;Martin, Patrick;McGinnity, Phillip;O’Hanley, Jesse;Olivo del Amo, Rosa;Parasiewicz, Piotr;Pusch, Martin;Rincon, Gonzalo;Rodriguez, Cesar;Royte, Joshua;Till Schneider, Claus;Tummers, Jeroen S.;Vallesi, Sergio;Vowles, Andrew;Verspoor, Eric;Wanningen, Herman;Wantzen, Karl M.;Wildman, Laura;Zalewski, Maciej",ORESU-R-20-014,ORESU-R-20-014,NA18OAR4170072,reprints (peer-reviewed),2020,Oregon Sea Grant,More than one million barriers fragment Europe's rivers,NA,NA,"Nature, Vol. 588: 438-441, 17 December 2020",NA,10.1038/s41586-​020-​3005-​2,NA,NA

Cultures were grown onGP2 artificial seawater medium (0.75mMnitrate, N:P = 16:1) at pH8.3 without iron or copper. Total equivalent nutrient loadings ranged from 0.5X to 9.1X GP2 for batch cultivation and 1.3X to 10.4X GP2 for fed-batch cultivation at delivery rates of 0.0067–0.16 mmol N L−1 day−1 based on nitrate. The multicellular, L. saccharina filamentous clumps were dispersed to nominal size of100 μm by mechanical blending (~ 16,000 rpm, 5 s) prior to inoculation. Fed-batch addition of all nutrients enhanced biomass productivity by a factor of two over a batch cultivation process at equivalent total nutrient loadings in a stirred-tank photo bioreactor. Peak productivity through fed-batch cultivation was 57 mg DCWL−1 day−1, and average final biomass densities exceeded 1800mg DCWL−1, vs. 30 mg DCWL−1 day−1 and 800–900 mg DCWL−1 for batch cultivation. However, there was a limit to biomass productivity enhancement at cumulative nutrient loadings greater than 3X GP2 that was not the result of insufficient CO2 or light delivery. It is suggested that the formation of large, multicellular clumps approaching 1-mm diameter during stirred-tank cultivation may have ultimately reduced biomass productivity during fed-batch cultivation under nutrient replete conditions.

Public preferences for energy policy play a role in determining energy futures, but researchers rarely simultaneously compare public views across multiple renewable and non-​renewable energies or across country boundaries. Here, we used a 2019 online survey sample (n = 1500) to compare predictors of support for eight fuel sources for electricity generation in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington and Oregon, USA. Results indicate the highest support overall for renewables (wind, solar, wave/tidal energy, geothermal) and the lowest for fossil fuels (coal and natural gas), nuclear, and hydropower. Mixed-effects regression modeling indicates that views on climate and the balance between environment and economy were consistent predictors of support across most energy types, while political ideology was less consistent. Perceived local importance of both extractive and renewable energy industries were significant predictors of support for some, but not all, energy sources, as were education and gender.

We estimate a discrete choice model of landowner armoring choices from 1990 to 2015 in the U.S.state of Oregon that suggests the impacts of spatial spillovers are highly influential determinants in these private adaptation decisions. Our landscape simulations excluding spatial spillovers may under-predict future armoring by 37e97 percent.

The appropriate extent of protection and the allowable uses are often the subject of public debate about marine protected area policy. Local community dynamics around marine protected area designation and management have been the subject of much ocean and coastal management social science research. However, broader public opinions and attitudes about marine protected areas are not well understood and are critical for managers seeking to maintain their public trust obligations in environmental management. This paper provides a model for understanding the attitudes and beliefs that foster public support for or opposition to marine protections. We explored the relationships between awareness, attitudes and beliefs towards coastal and marine resource issues and uses, and demographics among a sample of Oregon, USA residents (n = 459), and tested their influence on support for expanding Oregon’s recently established marine reserves. We found that Oregonians have relatively low familiarity with Oregon’s marine reserve system, but that familiarity did not influence public support for Oregon’smarine reserves. Instead, public support was lower among coastal residents and those with positive attitudes towards commercial fisheries, and higher for those concerned with the ecological integrity of Oregon’s ocean and supportive of some limits to human uses of the ocean. Our findings highlight the need for managers to engage both coastal communities and the general public to make a case for the value of marine protected areas in safeguarding the public trust.","Manson, Paul;Nielsen-Pincus, Max;Granek, Elise F.;Swearingen, Thomas C.",ORESU-R-21-002,ORESU-R-21-002,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),2021,Oregon Sea Grant,Public perceptions of ocean health and marine protection: Drivers of support for Oregon's marine reserves,Open access article,NA,"Ocean and Coastal Management, 201: Article 105480, February 15, 2021",NA,10.1016/j.oceco​aman.2020.10548​0,Elsevier Ltd.,NA270C-H

Incorporating uncertainty associated with both climate change and the range of possible adaptation measures is essential for projecting the evolving exposure to coastal flooding and erosion, as well as associated community vulnerability through time. A spatially explicit agent-based modeling platform, that provides a scenario-based framework for examining interactions between human and natural systems across a landscape, was used in Tillamook County, OR (USA) to explore strategies that may reduce exposure to coastal hazards within the context of climate change. Probabilistic simulations of extreme water levels were used to assess the impacts of variable projections of sea-level rise and storminess both as individual climate drivers and under a range of integrated climate change scenarios through the end of the century. Additionally, policy drivers, modeled both as individual management decisions and as policies integrated within adaptation scenarios, captured variability in possible human response to increased hazards risk. The relative contribution of variability and uncertainty from both climate change and policy decisions was quantified using three stakeholder-​relevant landscape performance metrics related to flooding, erosion, and recreational beach accessibility. In general, policy decisions introduced greater variability and uncertainty to the impacts of coastal hazards than climate change uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty across a suite of co-produced performance metrics can help determine the relative impact of management decisions on the adaptive capacity of communities under future climate scenarios.","Mills, Alexis K.;Ruggiero, Peter;Bolte, John P.;Serafin, Katherine A.;Lipiec, Eva",ORESU-R-21-003,ORESU-R-21-003,R/CNH-​30-​Ruggiero,reprints (peer-reviewed),2021,Oregon Sea Grant,Quantifying Uncertainty in Exposure to Coastal Hazards Associated with Both Climate Change and Adaptation Strategies: A U.S. Pacific Northwest Alternative Coastal Futures Analysis,Open access article,NA,"Water, 13(4): Article 545, February 20, 2021;Water 2021, 13(​4), 545; https://do​i.org/10.3390/w​13040545",NA,10.3390/w130405​45,MDPI,NA

While research has focused on physiological thresholds that influence the initiation of migration, few studies have investigated the relationship between both hydrological and thermal conditions and salmon spawning throughout the course of the reproductive period. We examined whether Oregon coastal coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) returning to three tributaries of the Smith River watershed (in the central Oregon Coast Range) responded to the stream hydroregime throughout their spawning period. Generalized linear mixed models were constructed to evaluate relationships between various stream discharge metrics, water temperature and redd count data collected between 2010 and 2016. Across the three sub-basins we analyzed, discharge and temperature metrics were important in explaining redd construction timing. However, the same parameters were not consistently important for every sub-basin. Water temperature was important in explaining redd construction in the largest sub-basin, North Sister Creek, and discharge metrics were consistently important in Beaver Creek, the smallest sub-basin. At the sub-basin scale, peak redd construction by coho salmon starts after an increase in discharge (25th percentile) occurs but before the highest discharge events take place. However, synchrony among sub-basins was evident in delayed redd construction during 2013 when the autumn rains were delayed.

To investigate the phenomenon of an observed oyster larvae die off, students explore the cause, impacts, and potential solutions for ocean acidification. ​Learning Goals: Students in grade levels 6-8 will learn the following: • Ocean acidification is the decrease in ocean pH that results from human activities that release excess CO2 into the atmosphere. The CO2 in the atmosphere is absorbed by the ocean and changes ocean chemistry. • The change in ocean pH makes it difficult for marine organisms like oysters to build their shells. • Humans can address the problem of ocean acidification by reducing the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere. Lea​rning Objectives: Students will be able to: 1. Construct an argument supported by empirical evidence that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, due to increased fossil fuel emissions, leads to ocean acidification. ​ 2.

For example,cultiva​tion of Gracilaria vermiculophylla on vertically stacked panels, deployed in raceway circulation tanks or in the open ocean, may enable process intensification​. A scalable process for panel inoculation is a first step toward this end. Clonal plantlets of G. vermiculophylla were mechanically blended (1000 rpm, 5 s) into tissue fragments of 2 cm nominal size, deposited on a 3-mm polypropylene mesh sheet, and then sprayed with a pressurized water jet at 4.5 bar in 0.1 s bursts with average velocity of 13m s−1. The force of the water jet pushed the 1 mm diameter thallus tissue fragments into the mesh openings, securing the plantlet to the mesh support. Gracilaria vermiculophylla test panels (7 cm per side) were placed in an upright orientation, with rising air bubbles providing fluid motion over the panel surface. During cultivation at saturation light intensity in nutrient-​replete medium,near-​exponential growth was sustained over 42 days at a specific growth rate of 8–9% per day, identical to the freely suspended thallus tissues. The tissue fragments proliferated over the panel surface and extended outward from the panel surface, ultimately creating a loose mat of tissue nearly 8–10 cm in thickness and biomass loadings exceeding 3000 g FW per m2 of panel surface.The steps used to prepare the G. vermiculophylla panels can be automated, and dense arrays of stationary G. vermiculophylla panels cultivated under defined current flow offer future potential for process intensification​.","Kraai, Joseph A.;Rorrer, Gregory L.",ORESU-R-21-006,ORESU-R-21-006,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),2021,Oregon Sea Grant,Immobilization and growth of clonal tissue fragments from the macrophytic red alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla on porous mesh panels,Article is open,NA,"Journal of Applied Phycology, 8pp., Published online: 12 March 2021: https://doi.org​/10.1007s10811-​021-​02436-​w",NA,10.1007/s10811-​021-​02436-​w,Springer,NA18OAR4170328

Five Pacific City-​type dories provided with outboard motors equipped with the hydraulic power take-off and gurdies were rigged and fished as trollers during the 1970 salmon trolling season. Five engines were employed in the project—40-​ and 60-hp Johnsons, a 50-hp Mercury, a 55-hp Fisher-Pierce Bearcat, and a 70-hp Chrysler. Each engine required the fabrication of a distinct hydraulic pump mount. All motors except the Chrysler 70 hp utilized a direct-drive in-line connection of the flywheel and pump shaft accomplished by a flex coupling. The Chrysler hydraulic power take-off consisted of a belt and pulley system. A concurrent effort was devoted to the design and testing of light-weight gurdies suitable for dories. The five dories logged a total of approximately 3,045 hours fishing time during the 1970season. Subsequent analysis of operational data, engines, and hydraulic components support the conclusion that a reliable, efficient, and relatively inexpensive hydraulic power take-off is attainable from outboard motors to power fishing machinery. Gurdies of light weight and durable construction suitable for dories were also designed and success fully tested and these gurdies will be offered to fishermen through a commercial source.","Fisher, R.

While charter boating there has had its ups and downs it has had nothing like the total collapse of the charter business in Michigan. Many services are offered the customer which are not available in the Great Lakes. Early in 1973, the idea came to an advisory service worker in the University of Michigan Sea Grant Program: with similar resources to be harvested in Oregon and Michigan, and with different traditions in the methods of harvesting, the time seemed ripe for an exchange of ideas between the two fishing communities. Counterparts of the Oregon State University Sea Grant Program agreed. Michigan and Oregon charter boat captains agreed. And two tackle manufacturers not only like the idea but generously supported financially an exchange of charter boat skippers between the Great Lakes (Michigan skippers) and the West Coast (Oregon skippers). Along with the differences in the fish, the Great Lakes skippers noted the apparently richer fish resources in the Pacific. The Oregon Fish Commission maintains a much larger stocking program for salmon than does Michigan. But, even without salmon, the ocean teems with catchable and edible fish. The Michigan skippers decided to put most emphasis on their return (from Oregon) to trying to establish some of the many support services for the business, such as the custom cannery, which had been established over many years on the coast. The Oregon skippers seemed most impressed with the effective combination of equipment and method which had been developed by the Michigan skippers and are testing it on the Oregon coast. The exchange was, of course, just the first step: the determination of which ideas were valuable to the other area. Sea Grant, with its charge of providing informal education to the water user, will continue to refine and disseminate this information for everyone's benefit.","Schneider, R.

To promote greater understanding of Ocean Engineering techniques and to identify areas of needed research, a series of weekly lectures was arranged during the Winter Quarter of 1971 on the Oregon State University Campus. Speakers were invited to give addresses to a wide range of technical and legal subjects dealing with problems involving the ocean and coastal environment. Students attending the seminars participated in exchanges with the speakers to hear about ocean engineering challenges and opportunities.

As a part of the study, the caloric content of larvae of various sizes was determined to provide a meaningful measure of mass. The effects of algal concentration (Monochrysis Lutheri) and larval density on the growth of larval oysters was measured in a flow-through feeding system. Algal concentration and larval food consumption can be optimized in a flow-through system to provide for maximum larval growth and efficient use of algal food. Removal of algae at the rate of 2,600 algal cells per larva per hour does not result in appreciably better growth than the removal of 1,300 algal cells per larva per hour. A modified flow-through feeding system, applied to a commercial oyster hatchery, could improve utilization of cultured algae, and yield increased larval growth.","Malouf, Robert E.;Breese, Wilbur P.",ORESU-R-77-033,"ORESU-​R-​77-​033; Technical Paper No. 4323, Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station",NA,reprints (not peer-reviewed),1977,Oregon Sea Grant,"Food Consumption and Growth of Larvae of the Pacific Oyster, Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg), in a Constant Flow Rearing System",NA,NA,"Proceedings of the National Shellfisheries Association, 67:1-10, June 1977",NA,NA,NA,NOAA Sea Grant No. 04-5-158-2

Work was begun on the construction of a large recreational resort on the spit in the early l900's. At the outset, the resort appeared to have a promising future. However, a three-year delay in the completion of the railroad to Tillamook created financial instability and lawsuits which continued up to the depression of the early 1930's. There soon followed severe erosion of Bayocean spit leading to its breaching in 1952 and forcing the abandonment of the deteriorated resort. The erosion appeared to have been initiated by the construction and subsequent lengthening of a north jetty to the Tillamook Bay channel, Rapid sand deposition north of the north jetty indicated that the structure had blocked a predominant north to south longshore sand transport, thus depriving the spit of sand and resulting in erosion. Simila​r occurrences have been documented at other coastal locations. However, analysis of historical shoreline changes and aerial photographs taken in 1971, 1972, and 1973 show that sand eroded from beaches to the north and to the south of the jetty has been transported and deposited immediately adjacent to both sides of the structure. This symmetrical pattern of erosion and deposition on both sides of the jetty indicates a reversing longshore sand transport with a near-zero net annual drift. The shoreline conditions at Bayocean demonstrate that beach erosion can result from the construction of a jetty transverse to a seasonally reversing longshore sand transport with a near-zero net drift.","Terich, Thomas A.;Komar, Paul D.",ORESU-T-73-003,ORESU-​T-​73-​003; Reference 73-16; NOAA-73112702,NA,technical reports/surveys​/patents,1973,Oregon Sea Grant,"DEVELOPMENT AND EROSION HISTORY OF BAYOCEAN SPIT, TILLAMOOK, OREGON",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOAA Sea Grant No. 2-35187

No jetties are present at the Siletz Bay inlet. Instead, the erosion is associated with rip currents, strong narrow currents that flow across the surf zone to out beyond the breakers. Rip currents erode embayments on the beach, at time cutting back into the dunes on which the houses were built.

Abstract models of industry have been constructed for this purpose but the diversity of organizational form between industry groups precludes an effective, universal theory. Market structure analysis consists of isolating those significant organizational ​ characteristics​ of a market which may affect the behavior of firms participating in that market, These firms organize the resources for the production of goods and services and allocate those resources. The salmon industry is particularly unique, both in organizational characteristics and geographic location. It would, therefore, seem logical to hypothesize that the industry is acted upon by certain unique forces. If policy measures are to be formulated for this important fishery, they should be founded upon a sound informational base, including a comprehensive description of the organizational structure and its relevant variables. This study does not propose changing market structure analysis; it does, however, argue that each industry may have unique characteristics and forces which will shape the structure of that industry. These factors may be completely outside the control of the decision makers within the industry. The traditional approach to market structure analysis is founded upon the assumption that decision makers within an industry have control of their destinies and policies are formulated toward that end.

The theoretical nondeterministi​c analysis is performed in the frequency domain for a two-​dimensional model. The ocean wave system is assumed to be a zero mean, stationary, ergodic Gaussian process described by a one-dimensional wave energy density spectrum. Hydrodynamic velocities and accelerations are computed from the wave energy density spectrum by the use of linear wave theory. The simulated stochastic wave forces are computed via the Morison equation which is modified to account both for the effects of wave-​structure interaction and for the equivalent linearization of the drag component in the time average mean square sense. The dynamic equations of motion for the wave-structure system are solved by the normal mode-​superposition technique. The coupled generalized damping matrix is diagonalized through an optimization procedure. The solution process is iterative both in the determination of the equivalently linearized drag term and in uncoupling the generalized damping matrix. The theoretical method is compared to responses computed from measured data collected in Wave Project II (WP II). Measured wave energy density spectra are computed from the wave elevation records by a finite Fourier transform algorithm. Pierson-​Moskowitz, Bretschneider and Scott theoretical wave energy density spectra are fitted to the variance and to the best least-squares estimate for the peak frequency of the measured spectra. The Scott spectrum shows a better assimulation of the measured wave energy spectrum in the magnitude of the peak frequency value. The WP II prototype structure is modeled by the lumped mass procedure and a linear Winkler foundation model is included. The computer program SAP IV is employed to obtain the natural frequencies and modal shapes of the wavestructure-​ soil model. The structural spectral displacement response is found to be represented largely by only the first mode of free vibration. The empirical equivalently linearized drag coefficient is determined by comparison of the measured and theoretical spectral characteristics of the generalized wave forces. The structural displacement spectra and frequency response functions are computed for the analyses of the structural response to measured and theoretical wave forces. A non-interaction theoretical analysis shows that a near resonant condition results in the structural displacement density spectra. A theoretical analysis, which includes the effects of wave-structure interaction, takes into account the hydrodynamic damping in the determination of the frequency response function. In the theoretical analysis, the spectral characteristics of the structural displacements are shown to be dependent on the characteristics of the wave energy density spectrum. The structural displacement density spectra for all analyses are found to be narrow banded when measured by both the Lonquet-​ Higgins and Vanmarke bandwidth parameters.","Grecco, Michael G.

In such an atmosphere, there are several avenues that help contribute to strong and vigorous programs. An important avenue is the contact that occurs among representatives of participating Sea Grant institutions that offers an opportunity to learn about programs being conducted in other parts of the country. Such exchange of information helps to avoid duplication of effort and enhances existing programs by fostering more rapid diffusion of information about them. Another avenue to program improvement offered by a conference such as this is the opportunity for direct input from the industrial and business sectors that are concerned with the direction Sea Grant takes. Sea Grant institutions learn more quickly the needs of industry; industry, in turn, finds out about progress that may offer opportunities for profit, Programs on the conference agenda were concerned with food and non-food resources. Participants were drawn from state and federal agencies, industry, universities, and other institutions with an interest in marine sciences. There was a real and successful attempt to get input from the men actively engaged in wresting a living from the sea. For example, active participants were leading fishermen. The nature of the material presented at the conference and reported here is indicative of the cooperative spirit of state and federal efforts to develop the resources of the oceans. A public awareness of the nature and results of these efforts will do much to further the goals of the National Sea Grant Program. Involving all interested groups in a National Sea Grant Conference leads to even better understanding and to a sharpened definition of our goal of the wise, planned use of the resources of the oceans.","Donaldson, John R.

Ne realize that estuaries are the rearing areas for many marine animals and that land fill and pollution have wiped out many estuaries on the shores of North America. Many life forms and the valuable aesthetics of the remaining estuaries of the Pacific Northwest are in danger. Thus, it is timely to review the problems involved in the preservation and proper utilization of the estuaries in this region. Speaker​s were invited to address themselves to a wide range of subjects -- some of a legal-political nature and others emphasizing estuarine technology . Sessions were devoted to modeling, hydrodynamics, ​ sediment transport, the ecology of estuaries, state and national legal policies and standards affecting developments of estuaries. It was demonstrated that very competent talent exists in the Pacific Northwest in governmental organizations, educational institutions, industry, and consulting firms to effectively handle technical problems concerning development and preservation of estuaries, However, the interactions between local groups and governmental groups at all levels needs to continue in order to effect needed standards and regulations to reduce the complex conflicts of use of the coastal zone. On the following pages appear the texts of papers delivered by the invited speakers to this first Technical Conference on Estuaries of the Pacific Northwest.",NA,ORESU-W-71-001,ORESU-​W-​71-​001; OSU Engineering Experiment Station Circular No. 42,NA,conference/work​shop proceedings,1971,Oregon Sea Grant,Proceedings of the 1971 (First) Technical Conference on Estuaries of the Pacific Northwest,NA,NA,NA,"Nath, John N.;Slotta, Larry S.",NA,Oregon State University (OSU) Sea Grant Program,NOAA Sea Grant No. 2-35127

The sensitivity of estuaries to man's abuses signals the need for better understanding of estuarine processes to prevent unintentional ruin. But the complexity of the estuary makes simplistic solutions unrealistic and detailed solutions difficult, The difficulties of the problem, of course, do not lessen the need for better answers and fresh approaches. The speakers at the Second Technical Conference on Estuaries of the Pacific Northwest, and their papers which follow, help fill that need. Several papers point out that estuaries are a social responsibility, requiring the cooperation of many individuals and the resolution of a multitude of conflicting interests. At the base of such cooperation and resolution is better understanding-​-​more hard facts--about how physical, chemical and biological attributes of estuaries interact Several papers provide better knowledge of estuarine ecosystems; several others, better knowledge of the physical properties of estuaries.

Is the Coast a 'local or a state-wide concern'?

We would design a course and conference entitled ""Literature and the Sea"" and thereby establish a framework within which artists, humanists, and scientists could work together to determine the impact that the world' s oceans have had on the creative impulse of the writer as well as investigate how the writer has helped to shape prevailing notions about the sea. For though our objective was the noble one of fusing the many cultures, the fact is that any viable or enduring union depends upon the recognition that there are inherent differences between the arts, the sciences and the humanities. And if we hoped that our artists and scientists would be able to talk with one another in any sort of meaningful fashion, that either group would be able to talk with humanists, and that the students in the class and our conference audience would be able to make sense out of what might appear to be a chaotic assortment of approaches and directions, we had to identify those crucial differences. This done, we felt we could move toward an understanding of the common ground shared by everyone involved in the program, irrespective of academic discipline.

The supporting pile structure provides vessel access to the facility for loading and mooring while allowing circulation in the underlying marine environment. The utility of the structure is enhanced measurably if locally occurring waves are attenuated rather than reflected, so that commercial and recreational vessel activities can proceed unimpeded. The design of a pile structure can include considerations for wave attenuation if a satisfactory predictive method is available to quantify the wave-pile interaction phenomena. A theory which accounts for directionally sensitive inertial and viscous damping has been develped for a two-dimensional structure interacting with monochromatic waves. An equivalent work linearizing procedure yields a potential flow problem satisfied by an eigen-series solution. Linear wave theory is applied outside the pile structure and a sea wall of arbitrary reflecting capacity may be specified at any distance from the leeward side of the structure. General solutions are matched at the sea-structure interface by requiring continuity of horizontal mass flux and pressure. The amplitude and phase of waves in the pile structure, the reflected wave and transmitted wave modes are solved from algebraic equations resulting from orthogonalizati​on of the interfacial boundary conditions. Comparison with experimental results are made. Optimization of design techniques with regard to wave-structure interaction with pile configurations are described. Enhancement of pile structure behavior with common surplus materials is discussed.","Dummer, Jerome H.;Sollitt, Charles K.",ORESU-T-80-005,ORESU-X-80-001; ORESU-T-80-005,NA,technical reports/surveys​/patents,1980,Oregon Sea Grant,Wave interaction with pile supported harbor facilities,See also related document ORESU-Y-80-001,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oregon State University Sea Grant Program,NOAA Sea Grant No. 04-2-158-44085;NOAA Sea Grant No. 04-8-M01-144

Rod Moore, assistant to U.S. Representative Don Young, challenged Alaska to develop its own expertise in resource management, harvesting techniques, processing, and marketing. Our geography, population distribution and potential, and political situation are unique, Moore said. We must ""be imaginative, be cooperative."" Others making presentations at the conference were personnel from the University of California, the College of Fisheries at St. John' s, Newfoundland, Clatsop Community College in Astoria, Oregon, the Jutland Technological Institute of Denmark, the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, and Oregon State University in Corvallis; the American Embassy in Tokyo; Nunam Kitlutsisti, which is the environmental arm of the Association of Village Council Presidents; the Alaska Food Company, Icicle Seafoods in Petersburg, and Peter Pan Seafoods; Groton Bio Industries in Massachusetts and Oregon Aqua-​Foods, which are involved in aquaculture; the Alaska Department of Fish and Game; the National Federation of Fishermen; and the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation. In a short three days those people attending the conference tackled the monumental task of identifying educational needs in terms specific enough for program development, From the many examples of programs in other places, they sought to conceive of appropriately scaled and designed programs that could be implemented here in Alaska. The programs of the Whitefish Authority at Hull, England, represented by Dr. Dennis Lodge, now with Clatsop Community College in Astoria, Oregon, illustrated that science and technology often go hand in hand in fisheries education. Lodge's example of such a partnership was the hydraulic flume tank used by the Whitefish Authority both to assist engineers in net design and to help fishermen learn to use these nets to increase their harvest. Actual vessel and sea conditions are duplicated in the tank. Lodge feels the United States, particularly the west coast, needs to have a tank to increase the competitiveness of the U.S. fishermen. He asked, ""Why not in Alaska?"" Following their presentations, the individual speakers conducted workshops with educators from around the state to discuss educat1on and training needs and methods specific for their area of expert1se. In these individual sessions it quickly became apparent that, due to the diversity of the communities in Alaska, the ""best"" education program and the ""most important"" needs often had little in common from one region to the next. Should one general overall program be designed so that 1t might fit all communities? Or should individual regions design programs that meet their special 1zed needs? It was not possible in the short time allowed to come up with the solutions to such mechanical problems, but it was possible to identify some of the most important fields where educational programs of one form or another are seriously needed today, or will be needed in the near future. The list was long and comprehensive. It included resource management, harvesting techniques, processing techniques, marketing, aquaculture, gear design and manufacture, electronics, vocationa1 and on-the-job training, entry-​level training, qua11ty control, engineering, operations and personnel management, communications, law, and politics.",NA,AKU-W-80-003,AK-SG-82-4;Alaska Sea Grant Report 82-4,A/75-01,conference/work​shop proceedings,1981,Alaska Sea Grant,Conference Report: Fishery Education in Alaska,NA,NA,"Proceedings of the Conference on Fisheries Education in Alaska: A Program of Excellence, December 8-12, 1980, Anchorage, Alaska","Smoker, William W.",NA,Alaska Sea Grant College Program,NA81AA-D-00009

They are commonly used as a filter and as a structural membrane between an undisturbed sediment surface below and an erosion resistant coarse aggregate above. Geotextiles provide a cost effective alternative to graded aggregate in marine foundations. The need for rational design procedures has led to a theoretical description of the combined soil-geotextile behavior which quantifies failure potential and facilitates optimum geotextile selection. A two-dimensionaI analytical model has been developed for a three-​layered system, two different soils separated by a geotextiIe. The soil response is modeled by Biot consolidation theory and an unsteady form of Darcy's equation in which each soil is considered homogeneous, isotropic and linearly elastic. The soil layers are coupled through the geotextile, which acts as an elastic permeable membrane. Soil displacements and stresses and fluid pressures and flows are determined analytically. Potential failure conditions are identified from the cyclic shear stress ratio and from a Mohr-Coulomb stress analysis.","McDougal, William G.;Sollitt, Charles K.;Vinson, Ted S.;Bell, J.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/5264975_785_2813799.csv,14,"In 1981, Sea Grant at Oregon State University produced the second in a series of documentary films about coastal issues and problems concerning citizens of the northwestern United States. This 28 minute film highlights the lower Columbia River-those last 26 miles of river where fresh water from the land and salt water from the sea merge. The estuary is an extremely productive environment and is essential to much of the fish and wildlife that inhabit the river and the north Pacific. Estuaries worldwide are being changed by human activities: the Columbia is no exception. But on the Columbia the world famous salmon resource hangs in the balance. What we do to the river and the estuary dramatically affects the salmon and the people who depend upon them. This film is both instructive and provocative. It addresses some tough questions.

Presently, the collection contains more than 1300 items ranging from ancient art to contemporary seascapes, from ships to flags and maps--a visual study exploring many aspects of our relationship to the sea. All items in the collection are available for classroom use. The collection is housed in the Art Department Slide Library, 215 Fairbanks Hall. The organization of this catalogue follows the arrangement of the collection; the numbered sections correspond to the contents of each tray of slides. the first five sections contain material on marine biology (I, Ia, II), charts (III), maps and diagrams (IV). The remaining sixteen sections represent marine subjects arranged by country of origin. A description of each slide is followed by its acquisition number in parentheses. This number is useful in locating individual slides in the collection. The Marine and Maritime Studies Program has been developed by the Oregon State University Humanities Development Program. Support for the Humanities Development Program comes from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Oregon State University Sea Grant College Program, and from Oregon State University.","Copek, Peter J.;McKenzie-​Carter, Laurie;Ajootian, Aileen;Sponenburgh, Mark",ORESU-F-82-002,ORESU-F-82-002,NA,educational materials,1982,Oregon Sea Grant,Marine and Maritime Slide Collection: Oregon State University,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,OSU Sea Grant College Program,NOAA Sea Grant

Oregon's Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) keeps count of more than 13 species of flatfishes landed commercially from state and adjacent waters. While the number of trawlers has been rising, the typical new boat may be up to twice the length of its predecessor, with proportionally ​ greater fishing capacity. For heavily exploited flatfish stocks, this trend points up urgent need for refining fisheries management capabilities. I​nvestigators in the Pacific Northwest have been stockpiling catch and effort statistics and biological data for 25 years. Their research has linked fluctuations in key fisheries with variations in physical and biological factors in the fishes ' environment. Russian trawlers first appeared in Oregon waters in 1966. Their intrusion onto previously uncontested domestic fishery grounds escalated fishing effort in the northeast Pacific and aggravated Americans. The Fishery Conservation and Management Act imposes a political solution to social and biological problems. This document is a response to requests from local fishing industry, which the project's principal investigators interpreted as indicative of need for a holistic study of the dynamics of the commercially important flatfish stocks off Oregon. The primary target species of the Oregon pleuronectid fishery are Dover, English, petrale, and rex sole.","Jackson, Charles;Carey, Andrew G.

Increasing demands on fish stocks by recreational and commercial fisheries as well as the degradation of many natural marine habitats has stimulated interest in artificial reefs. A variety of scrap materials have been used to construct reefs. The Port of Umpqua, Oregon has proposed to construct an artificial reef fabricated from scrap tires at the Z7 fathom contour off the coast. The intended purpose of the reef is to restore recreational bottom f1shing to this coastal area by enhancing habitats for bottom and reef f1shes. This coastal area experiences wave heights wh1ch exceed 30 feet annually. The forces associated with these waves are very large compared to those experienced at other reported reef sites. In order to prov1de a stable yet economical reef des1gn for this site, some basic information relating forces to wave induced water motions is required. This research has been funded by the Port of Umpqua and Sea Grant to 1nvestigate fundamental questions required to minimize construction costs and environmental risks while maximizing reef fishery production. Experimental studies were conducted 1n a large wave channel at the Oregon State University Rave Research Facility to evaluate wave force coefficients and bottom friction coefficients for reef components fabr​icated from tires. The results of the study are not site specific. The experimentally determined force coefficients may be applied to any location where design wave conditions are known.","Kim, Tae In;Sollitt, Charles K.;Hancock, Danil R.",ORESU-T-81-003,ORESU-T-81-003,R/CE-7,technical reports/surveys​/patents,1981,Oregon Sea Grant,WAVE FORCES ON SUBMERGED ARTIFICIAL REEFS FABRICATED FROM SCRAP TIRES,A Final Report to the Port of Umpqua Commission and Sea Grant.,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oregon State University Sea Grant,NOAA Sea Grant No. NA79AA-D-00106

The supporting pile structure provides vessel access to the facility for loading and mooring while allowing circulation in the underlying marine environment. The utility of the structure is enhanced measurably if locally occurring waves are attenuated rather than reflected, so that commercial and recreational vessel activities can proceed unimpeded. The design of a pile structure can include considerations for wave attenuation if a satisfactory predictive method is availab.ie to quantify the wave-pile Interaction phenomena. A theory which accounts for directionally sensitive inertial and viscous damping has been developed for a two-dimensional structure interacting with monochromatic waves. An equivalent work linearizing procedure yields a potential flow problem satisfied by an eigen- series solution. Linear wave theory is applied outside the pile structure and a sea wall of arbitrary reflecting capacity may be specified at any distance from the leeward side of the structure. General solutions are matched at the sea-​S structure interface by requiring continuity of horizontal mass flux and pressure. The amplitude and phase of waves in the pile structure, the reflected wave and transmitted wave modes are solved from algebraic equations resulting from orthogonalizati​on of the interfacial boundary conditions. Comparison with experimental results are made. Optimization of design techniques with regard to wavestructure interaction with pile configurations are described. Enhancement of pile structure behavior with common surplus materials is discussed.","Dummer, Jerome Martin Jr.",ORESU-Y-80-001,ORESU-X-80-002; ORESU-Y-80-001,NA,theses/disserta​tions,1980,Oregon Sea Grant,Wave interaction with pile supported harbor facilities,See also: ORESU-T-80-005,NA,NA,NA,NA,OSU Sea Grant,NOAA SEA GRANT

This discussion has four principal sectors to it. First, the role and function of transport in the U.S. will be examined with attention paid to the aggregate energy consumed. The second section will examine the differing production functions associated with the alternative transportation modes or different product movements. The third section delves specifically into the interaction of energy constraints, transportation and location of economic activity.

The controversy is inevitable, but in this handbook we try to do something about the confusion. We hope that this book will communicate effectively to a broad range of readers, but especially to those who are most affected by the workings of the bureaucratic machine created by the FCMA. In drafting the various chapters, the authors tried to keep two hypothetical readers in mind. One is a commercial fisherman, a person whose livelihood is directly regulated by the FCMA. The main text of each chapter was written with this reader in mind. The other hypothetical reader is a lawyer with no special training in fisheries law but who may be confronted with fisheries management problems through his clients. The notes at the end of each chapter, which contain citations to authorities and occasional, further explanation, are written for this reader. Of course, the fact that we limited our list of imagined readers to two was a drafting device only; our goal is to provide useful information and analysis to seafood processors, fisheries managers, legislators, the interested public, and all sorts of people who are neither fishermen nor lawyers.","Jacobson, Jon;Davis, Kevin;Hornstein, Donald;Reeves, Meg;Balagna, Steve;Thompson, Glen;Schoolcraft, Ken",ORESU-H-83-003,ORESU-H-83-003,R/PPA-17,"handbooks, manuals, guides",1983,Oregon Sea Grant,FEDERAL FISHERIES MANAGEMENT: A Guidebook to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oregon State University Sea Grant College Program,NOAA Sea Grant No. NA81AA-D-00086

The report also examines documented corrosion experience (much of which was done in U.S. Navy-funded tests over the last 15 or 20 years) and engineering recommendations for cathodic protection.

Because of the devastating effects of the 1982-83 El Nino, ocean catches of coho and chinook salmon off Oregon and Washington were the worst in recent history. Runs of several salmon stocks in Alaska, on the other hand, were at or near record highs. Salmon biologists have never been more aware of the importance of the ocean environment on salmon production than today. This workshop, held at Newport, Oregon, on November 8-10, 1983, had two major objectives: first, to review our knowledge of the effects of the ocean environment on the production of salmonid stocks of the North Pacific Ocean, emphasizing mechanisms linking interannual trends in survival, growth, and migrations with ocean variability; second, ta identify important research needs in order to develop strategies for future investigations of salmonids in the ocean.

Properly designed, constructed, and maintained, structures of this wood can provide long service, even in the ocean's harsh environment. This manual, cosponsored by the Forest Research Laboratory and the Sea Grant College Program of Oregon State University, is a companion to the previously published ""Wood Pole Maintenance Manual"" (Graham and Helsing 1979). It is directed to inspectors of marine wood and provides basic information on wood and wood-destroying organisms (borers) that harbormasters, port managers, and maintenance personnel can use in making wise decisions maintaining the waterfront structures in their charge. Designers and builders may also find this manual helpful in avoiding construction practices that contribute to wood deterioration. The savings could amount to many millions of dollars annually. You, the well-trained inspector, play a major role in achieving these savings. Early recognition of deterioration leads to mare economical repairs and remedial treatments to control the problem.","Morrell, Jeffrey J.;Helsing, Guy G.;Graham, Robert D.",ORESU-H-84-001,ORESU-​H-​84-​001; Research Bulletin 48,R/CP-18,"handbooks, manuals, guides",1984,Oregon Sea Grant,MARINE WOOD MAINTENANCE MANUAL: A GUIDE FOR PROPER USE OF DOUGLAS-FIR IN MARINE EXPOSURES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Oregon State University (OSU) Sea Grant, Forest Research Laboratory",NOAA Sea Grant

This and several subsequent workshops were funded by the Oregon State University and the University of Alaska Sea Grant College Programs and led to the decision to form a team of researchers from several countries in the world. Since then, economists from several seafood-​trading countries have combined efforts to explore trade issues. Coming from universities, government bodies, and private industry, the researchers are brought together by a common interest in fisheries issues and a willingness to try a team approach to research. The present volume, the first in a series, describes aspects of fisheries in five countries. It is designed to serve as a basis for communication among researchers, familiarize readers with aspects of seafood distribution in these countries, and provide an indication of the kinds of data available and their compatibility across countries. The report is descriptive. Future reports will be a mixture of description and analysis. This is the beginning of an experiment in international cooperation whose long-range consequences will, we hope, be far-reaching.

Based on agglutination reactions, four were found to have an antigenic composition distinctly different from that of the other thirteen. Thus the existence of two serotypes, referred to as I and II, was demonstrated. The group which included the Idaho strain (H1-70) was designated serotype I. Cultures of serotype I also differed from those of serotype II with respect to the fermentation of sorbitol. A bacterin prepared from a formalin killed culture of serotype II given intraperitoneal​ly to juvenile rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) protected them against infection with cultures of either serotype I or I I. Bacterin made from a culture of serotype I, however, provided protection against serotype infection, but not against serotype II.

One of the many long-term projects that made up the International Decade of Ocean Exploration Program, ISOS had been a vehicle through which U,S. scientists established contacts and exchanged data with Latin American scientists. No other significant support was available. Prospects were dimming for continuing the university's cooperative efforts with Latin American institutions.

To influence the states into full participation in the federal coastal program, Congress provided that when a state's management program has been approved by the Secretary of Commerce, thereafter all federal activities, projects, licenses, permits, and grants that significantly affect the coastal zone must be consistent with the state's program. There are some exceptions to this principle, discussed later, but generally, a state with an approved program (such as Oregon) is vested with power to decide what types of federal activities will be allowed in the coastal zone. Section 307 of the CZMA contains the consistency directives. There are five areas in which federal consistency with an approved state program is required: 1) federal agency activities significantly affecting the coastal zone; 2) federal agency development projects in the coastal zone; 3) federal licenses or permits to conduct an activity which significantly affects the coastal zone; 4) plans for the exploration, develoment, or production from an area leased under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act; and 5) federal assistance programs (grants) for proposed projects submitted by state or local governments which significantly affect the coastal zone. Section 307 has been fleshed out with regulations adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in March 1978. For each consistency area there are various issues to be discussed. Among these are: types of activities covered, who decides whether an activity is consistent, state review of the determination, conflict resolution between federal and state agency determinations, and exceptions to the consistency provisions.","BUCK, JAMES B",ORESU-T-79-008,ORESU-T-79-008,NA,technical reports/surveys​/patents,1979,Oregon Sea Grant,Federal Consistency,Report 3: The development of petroleum resources from the Outer Continental Shelf: Legal management problems and capabilities in Oregon,NA,NA,NA,NA,OSU Sea Grant,NOAA Sea Grant

It is one of a series of reports to the Governor's Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Development Task Force on legal issues associated with the development of petroleum resources and associated facilities. It is intended for the use of the members of the Task Force and other interested persons. Specific views and recommendations are those of the author and not necessarily the views of the Task Force, the Department of Land Conservation and Development, or other persons who provided assistance or information. Pipelines ruknning from the outer continental shelf, crossing state owned submerged lands, and terminating at alandfall on the shore present diverse issues for coastal planning agencies. Environmental impacts range from chronic leakage problems to siting of onshore facilities such as tank farms or refineries. Jurisdictional complexities abound; within the three mile territorial sea the state has primary authority over pipelines, but on the outer continental shelf (OCS), the U.S. Departments of Interior, Transportation, and Energy are all involved in pipeline regulation.

Each are well-known examples of how oil spill catastrophes can affect the marine and coastal environments and the lives of those who depend on these environments for their living. Each of these incidents, and others in turn, sparked public outcry, scientific studies, and legislative proposals to deal with the problem. The energy crisis, Alaska pipeline oil, deepwater ports, and increased OCS activity are indicators of the present and future scope of the problem. They too have sparked public discussion and legislative proposals. The scope of this paper is an outline and discussion of the various federal and state regulatory programs which have been formulated to deal with the oil spill pollution problem in three contexts: cleanup of spills, liability of spillers, and compensation for damages. The purpose of this analysis is to provide examples of how a state through its laws can deal with the problem of oil spill pollution. the text and footnotes are also designed to serve as a source of background material for legislative, regulatory, or managerial proposals. It should be noted that prevention of oil spills should be the primary goal of any program directed at the oil pollution problem. This aspect is discussed throughout the report in terms of pipelines, tankers, facility siting, and in this section where applicable.","Johansen, Kenneth;Parrish, Richard",ORESU-T-79-010,ORESU-T-79-010,NA,technical reports/surveys​/patents,1979,Oregon Sea Grant,Oil Spills/Oil Tanker Operations,Report 5: The development of petroleum resources from the Outer Continental Shelf: Legal management problems and capabilities in Oregon,NA,NA,NA,NA,OSU Sea Grant College Program,NOAA SEA GRANT

Ports are unique political subdivisions in Oregon's government scheme: they are elected autorities with local navigation and private commercial development as their major focus. Because of this dual local commercial emphasis, ports are competitive among themselves, each trying to attract potential developers. Oregon ports which presently handle petroleum products and/or crude oil include Portland, St. Helens, Astoria, Newport, Umpqua and Coos Bay. This paper examines ports' potential to promote, influence and regulate activities and development associated with OCS petroleum resources, activities of regional, statewide and national significance.","Evans, Martha",ORESU-T-79-011,ORESU-T-79-011,NA,technical reports/surveys​/patents,1979,Oregon Sea Grant,Ports and Onshore Facilities,Report 6: The development of petroleum resources from the Outer Continental Shelf: Legal management problems and capabilities in Oregon,NA,NA,NA,NA,OSU Sea Grant College Program,NOAA Sea Grant
/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/5331958_1078_2814092.csv,70,"The siting of energy facilities in the Oregon coastal zone presents a delicate question of balance: On the one hand is the notion of preserving the coast in its most natural, and thus most beautiful condition; whil on the other hand is the notion of utilizing available land to fulfill the state's obligation to provide Oregonians and others with sufficient numbers of energy facilities to meet their energy needs. Ecological, cultural, historic, and aesthetic values in the coastal zone are essential to the well-being of the people. Yet one of the national objectives is to attain a greater degree of energy self-​sufficiency. Due to the water-dependent and water-related nature of certain types of energy facilities, e.g., liquefield natural gas (LNG) marine terminals, it is a foregone conclusion that there will be energy facilities located in the coastal zone. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) is an attempt by the federal government to reconcile these, and other opposing concepts. Energy facilities significantly impact local, state, federal, and perhaps international interests. There are two levels of concern to be addressed. First is the question of whether an energy facility is to be located in the coastal zone, a question affecting all levels but with an important national significance. Second is the question of where such a facility will be located, a question with important local and state significance. This chapter encounters these two questions as they relate to the general siting of LNG facilities. It will discuss the development of LNG in Oregon as it is, or may be, affected by various important studies and reports, various statutory and regulatory schemes on the federal and state levels, and recent judicial and administrative decisions. It will conclude with recommendations for improvements in the Oregon Coastal Management Program and changes in the Oregon Revised Statutes.","Berger, Matthew",ORESU-T-79-012,ORESU-T-79-012,NA,technical reports/surveys​/patents,1979,Oregon Sea Grant,Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities,Report 7: The development of petroleum resources from the Outer Continental Shelf: Legal management problems and capabilities in Oregon,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Losses of cultured salmonids to the disease increased more than twentyfold from 1980 to 1981, and mortality-​related losses were almost forty times that of 1980 levels during 1982. Extreme modifications of conventional hatchery practices have been adopted at certain locations where viral-infected stocks of fish must be used as a source for eggs. Because the virus is now widespread in the basin, personnel at locations with no previous history of IHNV must be especially alert to prevent its introduction.","GROBERG, W. J. JR.;FRYER, J.

The equation of motion is cast into a general form which enables a comparison of the various models. Analytic solutions for longshore currents are developed for seven different mixing models. A nonplanar beach profile is employed because it has been found to be representative of many beaches and it allows for a distinction between offshore and depth scaling of eddies. The seven different mixing models include models which vary monotonically with horizontal distance offshore and models which change format at the breaker line. Numerical results indicate that the longshore current profile is rather insensitive to the form of the mixing model for nonplanar beach profiles.,"McDougal, William G.;Hudspeth, Robert T.",ORESU-R-86-024,ORESU-R-86-024,R/CE-13,reprints (peer-reviewed),1986,Oregon Sea Grant,Influence of lateral mixing on longshore currents,NA,NA,"""Ocean Engineering,"" 13(5):419-433, 1986.",NA,NA,NA,NOAA Sea Grant

The demand model assumes that individuals minimize the cost of producing the services derived from recreational boating. This minimization presents the boat owner with a cost function that is incorporated into the budget constraint. The resultant demand functions show that the demand for moorage depends on variables which affect the cost of boating (e.g., the price of moorage, the cost of travel between the owner's residence and the moorage site), variables which affect owner preferences for boating (e.g., fishing activity), and variables which affect cost and preferences (e.g., location of residence). The most important findings of the study are (a) the demand for moorage is price-elastic, (b) the demands for moorage at specific locations are more elastic than the aggregate demand along the entire Oregon coast, and (c) the absolute responsiveness of demand to unit changes in moorage rates is about the same at alternative locations.","Vars, R.

Using a new method to estimate the random wave force, we were able to predict the force spectra and force time series for a given wave profile.

Since the design for these platforms is increasingly refined for large, expensive structures, knowledge of forces on individual cylindrical members becomes increasingly important. This work concerns horizontal cylindrical members in periodic waves and in periodic waves with towing (waves plus current). Laboratory experiments were run on cylinders with different surfaces: smooth, sand-roughened, barnacle-​roughened, and one with rigid, artificial sea anemones. Both amplitudes and phases of harmonic components of horizontal and vertical forces were analyzed by Fourier analysis. Flow visualization techniques were used to observe flow around stationary horizontal cylinders. Wave-to-wave variations of forces were clearly observed. It was found that the vortex motions contribute strongly to the variations of force coefficients. Such variations are smaller in the horizontal direction and for the rougher cylinders.","Teng, Chung-Chu;Nath, John H.",ORESU-O-86-002,ORESU-O-86-002,R/CE-20-PD,technical reports/surveys​/patents,1986,Oregon Sea Grant,Smooth and roughened horizontal cylinders in periodic waves and current,This report is essentially the thesis for the partial fulfillment of the Ph.D. program in Civil Engineering with emphasis in Ocean Engineering for the first author.,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oregon State University Sea Grant College Program,NOAA Sea Grant;NSF No. CEE-8310732-01

The project led the Oregon Legislature to reform the state's standards for hydroelectric permits, and induced the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to interpret away NMFS's ability to prescribe binding conditions on projects qualifying for exemptions from federal licenses. FERC's failure to satisfy NEPA requirements caused the project to shut down in December 1985.

Accordingly, four prototype systems made largely of wood with plastic vessels for floatation have been built and tested over a period of 18 months. Results demonstrate the feasibility of submersible systems based on the prototypes.","Robertson, G. W.;Cashin, M.

Natural resource managers at the local, state and federal levels have made an effort to stem this tide of adverse impacts. They have implemented procedures aimed at restoring, creating or enhancing estuarine habitat to mitigate unavoidable environmental damage. This paper discusses estuarine mitigation in the Pacific Northwest and the relationship of mitigation to other resource management strategies. Overall mitigation strategies and goals for individual projects are outlined, followed by a discussion of regional goals and estuary-wide mitigation planning.

Moreover, whereas preservation of yield capacity and maximization of yield are largely compatible for single species management, adopting a multispecies perspective increases the chance that such objectives will conflict. There are significant constraints on the ability to achieve objectives for multispecies fisheries, not least the fact that a common objective for multispecies fisheries (maximized yield of each species) is unattainable for systems containing interactions among species. The adoption of firm objectives for fisheries that contain biological or technological interactions presumes levels of knowledge or control that are unlikely to be obtainable or desirable; therefore, it is suggested that a more feasible approach to defining objectives is to seek satisfactory and progressively improved management solutions.","Pikitch, Ellen K.",ORESU-R-88-024,ORESU-R-88-024,R/ES-7,reprints (peer-reviewed),1988,Oregon Sea Grant,Objectives for Biologically and Technically Interrelated Fisheries,NA,NA,"In: Wooster, Warren S.

The management regime failed to meet its two major goals: to conserve key species and to maintain a year-round groundfish fishery. Given the failure of the current system to meet management goals, it would appear warranted to explore some alternatives: (1) modifying the trip poundage quota system, (2) eliminating trip quotas and establishing quarterly or trimesterly quotas, (3) replacing trip poundage limits with trip time limits, (4) relying to a greater degree on gear regulations in management, (5) limiting the number of participants in the fishery, (6) modifying the objectives of management, (7) some combination of the above. This report was prepared at the request of staff of the Pacific Fishery Management Council and several of its advisory bodies in order to provide timely information to the Council on the effectiveness of past management practices.

Fish can become infected in water at temperatures as low as 4 to 6 deg C; however, progress of the disease is temperature-​dependent, and more infections are detected after the water warms. Only salmonids are susceptible to ""C. shasta"" infection, but susceptibility may vary within a species. ""C. shasta"" has been identified in salmonids from marine and freshwater environments in northern California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and British Columbia. The life history of the parasite is unknown. The most successful approach for control of certomyxosis in both hatchery and wild populations is the introduction of resistant salmonids.","Bartholomew, J. L.;Rohovec, J. S.;Fryer, J.

The combination of mechanisms involved in recruitment were studied more readily with explicit numerical and functional relationships by use of a simulation modeling approach than by the usual approach of fitting a multivariate response surface.","Kruse, Gordon H.;Tyler, Albert V.",ORESU-R-89-017,ORESU-R-89-017,R/OPF-16,reprints (peer-reviewed),1989,Oregon Sea Grant,Exploratory simulation of English sole recruitment mechanisms,NA,NA,"""Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,"" 118:101-118, 1989.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Section 404 has always been controversial. To its critics, the 404 permit program represents an unprecedented federal presence in land use regulation. To its defenders, it remains the most effective means of preserving the nation's diminishing wetland resources. The most troublesome questions concerning the program's jurisdictional scope, permit criteria, and enforcement are the consequence of a long-held regulatory ambivalence on the part of the permit-issuing entity. The authors evaluate the 404 program, its history, its operation, and its future. In addition to suggesting a number of administrative reforms, they reluctantly recommend that Congress relieve the Corps of Engineers of its permit-issuing responsibilitie​s.","Blumm, Michael C.;Zaleha, D.

What happens to the Northwest's wild trout, steelhead and salmon in the 21st century will be influenced by plans now on the drawing board. In particular, resource managers are attempting to establish the significance of wild fish, to define the impact of hatchery-​produced fish on their wild counterparts, to restore or mitigate for populations injured by hydropower developments, and to agree upon harvest management policies that sustain fish populations as well as fishermen. They are also beginning to confront the effects of agricultural practices on fish populations. Representatives of government agencies, Indian tribes and private organizations convened to address these concerns at a symposium whose proceedings are offered here.

The first is insulation thickness, which varies significantly in practice. The second is penetration of steel frames, which act as `thermal bridges' across the insulated section, dramatically increasing heat flow in some cases. The third factor relates to materials and fasteners for the inside liners. Objectives of research reported here have been to better understand factors influencing thermal resistance of fish hold sections and to better appreciate potential hazards of poor insulation practices.

Although there are four distinct categories of remedies in the case law, they all possess the unifying theme of promoting public access to trust resources or to decision makers with authority to allocate those resources. Thus, the trust doctrine is a democratizing force-​-​preventing the monopoly of trust resources and promoting decision making that is accountable to the public. State courts will continue to expand the public trust, relying especially on constitutional provisions that declare water to be publicly owned. The doctrine is a coherent body of law that supplies a necessary complement to prior appropriation principles, is not inconsistent with fifth amendment `takings' jurisprudence, and has sufficient grounding in various state constitutions and statutes to continue to infuse public concerns into western water law in the years ahead. not available from ORESU; a copy of the journal issue this article appeared in may be ordered for $10.00 from: ""Environmental Law"", Northwestern School of Law, 10015 SW Terwilliger Blvd., Portland, OR 97219.

Aerial high-resolution photography offers a promising alternative in quasi-synoptic surveys of phytoplankton signals from inland water systems. A model has been designed relating radiance emitted by surface layer waters in inland sounds to the potential of phytoplankton bloom intensity; it is calibrated to conditions that exist at the beginning of the spring and fall seasons, the times of transition between winter and summer during which the intense phytoplankton blooms associated with noxious red tides tend to occur.","Neshyba, Steve;Clement, Alejandro",ORESU-R-89-006,ORESU-R-89-006,E/ISG-6,reprints (peer-reviewed),1989,Oregon Sea Grant,An index for phytoplankton bloom in inland seas based on spectrum density in aerial photographs,NA,NA,"""The Pacific, Bridge or Barrier?""

The major potential impacts are identified as (1) a possible `boom-and-bust' cycle in the coastal economy and (2) the possiblity of a large oil spill. Both are effects to which the northwest coast is particularly vulnerable. The conventional wisdom is defied by findings that the northwest economy appears to have little to gain from offshore petroleum production.

The next challenge for Canada appears to be to construct an effective mutiple-use EEZ management structure with significant provincial participation.","Hildreth, Richard G.",ORESU-R-91-027,ORESU-R-91-027,R/PPA-33,reprints (peer-reviewed),1991,Oregon Sea Grant,Managing ocean resources: Canada,NA,NA,"""International Journal of Estuarine and Coastal Law,"" 199- 228, 1991.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Ocean policymakers in the executive branch have resisted proposed comprehensive EEZ legislation that would improve cooperation between agencies and between levels of government. Instead, they make piecemeal amendments to the many federal statutes governing EEZ resource use. While none of the four countries studied in this series of articles has instituted multiple-use management on an EEZ-wide basis, each has done so for particular zones or specially designated areas.

Three ranching programs-​-​Oregon coho, Japan chum, and Alaska pink salmon--are examined here for evidence that ocean mortality from natural causes is directly dependent on abundance of smolts.

Current evidence from the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) regarding disputes between countries, such as the U.S.-Canada dispute over trade in raw herring, suggests that bilateral trade in raw fish among major exporters of seafood products may not be completely free of structural and political barriers. Models show that restrictions on the exportation of raw fish from an exporting country can make possible monopsony behavior by fish processors in a rival exporting country and they outline the market behavior of the players under such circumstances. The analysis illustrates how, under such conditions, economic forces contribute to the creation of trade disputes.

Although vaccines for IHNV are under development, present control measures for the disease require testing of hatchery populations for the virus and destruction of infected populations. Virus typically is detected by isolating the virus in tissue culture and then confirming its identity via serum neutralization. These methods are sensitive for infectious virus but are labor intensive and often provide answers long after the epizootic. A polymerase chain reaction method has been developed to amplify a portion of the ""N"" gene of IHNV directly from viral genomic RNA in freshly sampled fish tissues. This method was shown to be rapid, specific and very sensitive. In this paper, a simple method for the detection of the ""N""-specific RNA purified from formalin-fixed, paraffin-​embedded fish tissues is described.","Chiou, Pinwen P.;Drolet, Barbara S.;Leong, Jo-Ann C.",ORESU-R-95-003,ORESU-R-95-003,R/FSD-23,reprints (peer-reviewed),1995,Oregon Sea Grant,Polymerase chain amplification of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus RNA extracted from fixed and embedded fish tissue,NA,NA,"""Journal of Aquatic Animal Health,"" 7:9-15, 1995.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Missing from the original acts was the recognition that natural resources, including those in the ocean, cannot be sufficiently protected or successfully managed in isolation from one another. Each law was passed with scant notice of the impact it would have on the others. The issues discussed in this paper involve concrete attempts to work out conflicting uses of ocean space and resources between human interests, through such techniques as buffer zones, to avoid losing biological diversity. The paper explains the complex network of incidental-take provisions of the MMPA, ESA and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) and shows where and how they interact. It reviews and critiques the National Marine Fisheries Service and MMPA Negotiating Group's proposals for amending the incidental-take provisions and describes current real-world interactions. The authors conclude that a more holistic approach to protection and management of marine resources is needed but unlikely to be successfully implemented for an umber of reasons: the mobility of the marine species of concern, the fluid nature of their environment, the mixed track record of the federal agencies charged with their protection and management, and congressional inability to legislate in other than a piecemeal fashion.","Jarman, M.

A state-​dependent, temporal model of discarding behavior within a fishing trip is derived. This optimization considers the availability of differently valued fish, trip quotas set by the regulatory agency, and the risk of premature trip termination due to loss of gear or injury. The results indicate that those parameters affect discarding behavior through their effect on the probability of exceeding the allowable catch, which was considered analogous to gut capacity.

The wave pressure on the face and base of the caisson can cause sliding or overturning failures. Various techniques have been proposed which address these questions in a rather piecemeal manner. In the present study, a coupled flow field model is developed to theoretically examine the interaction of waves with a composite breakwater. Analytical and numerical models have been developed for the interaction of simple periodic, linear wave with a caisson founded on a coarse rubble base. For the high permeability rubble typically used as the caisson foundation, the pressure distribution along the caisson base is nearly linear.","Sulisz, Wojciech;McDougal, William G.",ORESU-R-88-050,ORESU-R-88-050,R/CE-18,reprints (not peer-reviewed),1988,Oregon Sea Grant,Wave interaction with a composite breakwater,NA,NA,"""Proceedings of Conference on Computer Modeling in Ocean Engineering,"" pp. 715-721, Venice, Italy, 1988.",NA,NA,NA,NA

In the recent literature, two contradictory descriptions of these long-term changes as they relate to phytoplankton nitrogen utilization have emerged. The first, characterized as the 'shift-up' response, hypothesizes that during an upwelling event the phytoplankton assemblage undergoes an acceleration from initially low biomass- specific (V;h-1) rates of nitrogen (NO3-) utilization until a maximal rate is achieved some seveal days after the onset of upwelling. An alternative hypothesis suggest that phytoplankton asssemblages off coastal Oregon are adapted to local conditions even during upwelling events with no evidence for a shift-up response; it suggests that any perceived changes in phytoplankton physiology are artificial in nature, that perceived changes in specific nitrogen uptake rates are a function of biomass and nutrient concentrations, and are not indicative of physiological adaptation.

Wick (October 24, 1927-December 15, 1991). Words from Robert E. Malouf, Directory, Oregon Sea Grant: I'm relatively new to Oregon Sea Grant, having come here less than two years ago. But what strikes me about this program is its long and, I think, excellent track record. As coastal and marine issues have evolved, Oregon Sea Grant has been in the right places at the right times, pushing issues forward and helping people use coastal resources wisely. Sea Grant has been a catalyst, providing start-up money for worthwhile projects, supporting people who have shaped our understanding of the ocean. Sea Grant hasn't always been visible-by name. It seems to me that Sea Grant people here in Oregon care more about getting the job done than they do about getting credit for it. As a result, it's sometimes difficult to get a handle on just what Sea Grant is. It's not just a program or a network. It is an approach to solving problems and addressing opportunities. Sea Grant is a way of thinking. Most important, it is people. For a quarter of a century, our people have touched every aspect of coastal life, solving problems and addressing needs through research, extension, and communications. Research is something we do very well. Sea Grant's highly competitive research grants program is structured to select and support only the finest science. But if you really want to make things happen, research alone is not enough. What makes Sea Grant different is our institutionaliz​ed and carefully nurtured association with coastal decision makers, resource users and managers, and everyday citizens. Our Extension Sea Grant Program and Communications Office are among our most visible elements, helping ensure that the results of relevant, timely research are broadly disseminated- and, more important, that they are put to work. Sea Grant is uniquely adept at striking a balance between the necessarily deliberate pace of cutting-edge scientific inquiry and the public's need to know answers now, and to act now, to address pressing issues. I'm getting into the swing of Oregon Sea Grant and I must say that it's an exciting place to be. Let me share with you a few highlights of the Oregon program-​scientists, Extension agents, and communicators and the things they have done or helped make happen.

Others observed that when Pacific whiting stabilized mince was heated at current density of 2300 A/m2 and at AC electrical frequencies of 5000 Hz and higher, the corrosion on the stainless steel electrode surface essentially disappeared.

For a number of freshwater species, it has been demonstrated that myxozoans undergo 2 developmental cycles, one of them (myxosporean) in the fish and the other (actinosporean) in an aquatic oligochaete or polychaete worm. Each cycle terminates in a spore stage, which is infective for the other host. However, the routes of infection, life cycle and pathogenesis are still unknown for the vast majority of species, making their control very difficult.

The need for protecting, preserving, and restoring these valuable ecosystems was a major factor in passage of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) in 1972. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of state coastal management programs (CMPs) in protection of estuaries and coastal wetlands. This study seeks to determine the extent to which effectiveness can be demonstrated by on- the-ground outcomes of CZM policy implementation. The research involved extensive collaboration with the states. Data collection and state profile development were based on published information, a series of structured interviews with state officials, and unpublished information from reports, permit tracking databases, and other sources. Individual state programs were evaluated to determine: (1) the importance of the issue in the state;(2) the potential effectiveness of the program, based on analysis of the policies, processes and tools used;(3) the on-the- ground outcome effectiveness based on analysis of income indicators; and (4)overall context-based performance. Tidal and nontidal management efforts were evaluated separately for both ecological and legal- institutional reasons. Findings and recommendations are listed. Among the findings were that the issue of protection is widely regarded as important, that most CMPs 'look good on paper' but the outcome measures are more modest, particularly where insufficient data has been acquired. Recommendations are made to standardize performance evaluation, improve nontidal freshwater wetland management, and establish coastal restoration policies.","Good, James W.;Weber, John W.;Charland, James W.;Olson, John V.;Chapin, Kelly A.",ORESU-T-98-001,ORESU-T-98-001;Oregon Sea Grant Special Report PI-98-001,R/PPA-42;A/ESG-3,technical reports/surveys​/patents,1998,Oregon Sea Grant,National Coastal Zone Management Effectiveness Study: Protecting Estuaries and Coastal Wetlands (Final Report),See also: WASHU-O-98-001 (WSG-MR 99-01) for full copy with appendices;Hard copy of ORESU-T-98-001 is 190 pages; digital is only 84 pages (digital does not include the appendices),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA36RG0451

The Bayshore plant is located in the city of Oregon, near the mouth of the river and the Acme plant is located in Toledo approximately 5 miles upstream. Both plants are sited on the east shore of the Maumee River and both draw cooling water from this stream. The cooling water intake at the Bayshore facility consists of a channel 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) long and 250 feet (76 meters) wide, which extends in a southeasterly direction from the river mouth to the plant located on the shore of Maumee Bay. The Bayshore facility uses eight circulating water pumps (approximately 65,020 gpm each) to draw cooling water through this channel to the plant at a maximum rate of 520,138 gpm. this rate of pumping would allow the plant to empty its intake channel every 4.26 hours or 5.64 times a day. The heated cooling water is released directly into Maumee Bay through a narrow discharge channel. The Acme plant is 500 feet (152.4 meters) from the Maumee River and utilizes a narrow concrete intake structure, whic his set perpendicular to the shoreline. The maximum pumping rate at the Acme facility is 275,694 gpm. The thermal discharge from the plant enters the river a short distance downstream.

The genus has been widespread in these coastal waters, and more than a dozen species have been identified, with the number still increasing. Dominance shifts among species on time scales of weeks, months, and years. There is direct evidence of increases of cell numbers with even small amounts of upwelling, whereas some blooms have coincided with times of low expectation of upwelling. Original data from W.E. Allen's notes provided by W.H. Thomas, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, suggest a possible explanation, borne out by recent culturing work. Viable cells can sink from the surface waters and rise in a different growth stage.

Most FAAH blockers developed to date also inhibit cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and/or bind to the CB1 cannabinoid receptor subtype. Here we report the finding of four novel FAAH inhibitors, two of which, malhamensilipin A and grenadadiene, were screened out of a series of thirty-two different algal natural products, and two others arachidonoyleth​ylene glycol (AEG) and arachidonoyl-​serotonin (AA-5-HT) were selected out of five artificially functionalized polyunsaturated fatty acids. When using FAAH preparations from mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells and [14 C]anandamdie as a substate, the IC 50s for these compounds ranging from 12.0 to 26 mu M, the most active compound being AA-5-HT. This substance was also active on FAAH from rate basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells (IC 50 � 5.6 mu M), and inhibited [14C]anandamide hydrolysis by both N18TG2 and RBL-2H3 intact cells without affecting [14 C]anandamide uptake. While AEG behaved as a competitive inhibitor and was hydrolyzed to arachidonic acid (AA)by FAAH preparations, AA-5-HT was resistant to FAH-catalyzed hydrolysis and behaved as a tight-binding, albeit non-covalent, mixed inhibitor. AA-5-HT did not interfere with cPLA 2-mediated, ionomycin or antigen- induced release of [3 H]AA from RBL-2H3 cells, nor with CPLA2 activity in cell-free experiments. Finally, AA-5-HT did not activate CB1 cannabinoid receptors since it acted as a very week ligand in in vitro binding assays, and, at 10-15 mg/kg body weight, it was not active in the 'open field', 'hot plate' and rectal hypothermia tests carried out in mice. Conversely AEG behaved as a cannabimimetic substance in these tests as well as in the 'ring' immobility test where AA-5-HT was also active. AA-5-HT is the first FAAH inhibitor reported to date which is inactive both against cPLA2 and at CB1 rectors, whereas AEG represents a new type of cannabinoid receptor agonist.","Bisogno, T.;Melck, D.;De Petrocellis, L.;Bobrov, M.

These eicosaoid-like structures vary in chain length, oxidation pattern, cyclization pattern, and the type of incorporated heteroatoms. Because of the nature of eiconsanoid-​like compounds found in nonmammals, the author uses a somewhat expanded definition of ""eicosanoid."" Specifically, he discusses polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of any chain length that are metabolized to distinct structures. The chapter is organized along strictly taxonomic lines. It begins with the most primitive group, the bacteria, including cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). The bacteria are followed by the primitive eukaryotes, fungi and yeasts, and then algae, predominately the macrophytic marine algae. After that, the author reviews the oxylipins of higher plants, arranged along familial lines; animal oxylipins, arranged sequentially and beginning with fish; and then marine invertebrates, insects, amphibians, arachnids, and worms. Space limitations meant that discussion of newer examples of oxylipins is given precedence over old, oxylipins illustrated trends over those representing exceptions, and structurally complex oxylipins over those of more straightforward structure.

They grouped landings of Dungeness crab ""Cancer magister"" in two large geographic zones by combining fishery ports as adjacent to Large Estuarine Zones (LEZ; Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay, and both sides of the Columbia River) and Small Estuarine Zones (SEZ; all other ports in Oregon). Mortality estimates were used to reduce 1+ crab abundance to surviving legal males, and portrayed as percent of the fisheries. Trends in the SEZ indicate that an average of only about 5-7 percent of estuarine production adds to coastal adult population. The contribution is 25-30 percent in the LEZ (or higher). The data indicate that estuarine juvenile production provides a relatively stable source of recruits to coastal adult populations, and large systems in the LEZ are important nurseries. Since direct coastal settlement of larvae does occur but is highly variable, the estuarine contribution may be especially important when physical forcing or unusual events lead to low survival of the coastal 0+ cohort.","Armstrong, David A.;Rooper, Chris;Gunderson, Donald",WASHU-R-03-010,WSG-TA 04-16,R/F-68,reprints (peer-reviewed),2003,Washington Sea Grant,"Estuarine production of juvenile Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") and contribution to the Oregon- Washington coastal fishery",NA,NA,"""Estuaries,"" 26(4B):1174-​1188, August 2003.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Larvae from the oldest females had growth rates more than three times as fast and survived starvation more than twice as long as larvae from the youngest females. Female age was a far better predictor of larval performance than female size. The apparent underlying mechanism is a greater provisioning of larvae with energy-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids as female age increases. The volume of the oil globule (composed primarily of TAG) present in larvae at parturition increases with maternal age and is correlated with subsequent growth and survival. Age truncation commonly induced by fisheries may, therefore, have severe consequences for long-term sustainability of fish populations.","Berkeley, Steven A.;Chapman, Colin;Sogard, Susan M.",ORESU-R-04-010,ORESU-R-04-010,R/RCF-01;R/RCF-01-PD,reprints (peer-reviewed),2004,Oregon Sea Grant,"Maternal age as a determinant of larval growth and survival in a marine fish, ""Sebastes melanops.""",NA,NA,"""Ecology,"" 85(5):1258-​1264, 2004.",NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, the program can simultaneously analyze data on catch biomass, age composition, stock abundance, and fishing effort, which are likely to be subject to different levels and types of error. Also, the Stock Synthesis results are probably sensitive to biological traits of the fish (e.g., longevity and growth), characteristics of the fishery (e.g., exploitation rate and selection pattern), and the levels of observation error in the input data series. Determining the impact of these factors on the accuracy of Stock Synthesis estimates should help users understand the model's performance and identify which input data are most in need of improvement.

Management capacity comprises the knowledge, skills and processes that enable the effective development, implementation and enforcement of regulations. The theme of this paper is that building effective management capacity involves not only education to provide knowledge but also an incentive environment compatible with the effective application of that knowledge. The U.S. regional fishery management councils involve people with diverse expertise. The type and quantity of knowledge needed to effectively manage fisheries has changed over time. The new management portfolio includes yield stabilization, bycatch reduction, stock rebuilding, capacity reduction, habitat protection, and ecosystem considerations. The management performance of many U.S. fisheries suggests that managers do not have the required knowledge base to manage the new management portfolio. It is also clear that incentives facing managers are often incompatible with taking a long-term ecosystem approach to management. Problems resulting from power ambiguity, low-intensive incentives, moral hazard, bounded rationally, and a failure to make credible commitments make it difficult for managers to make long-term decisions and take action to reduce uncertainty. The incentive problems in U.S. fishery management illustrate not only the lack of alignment of private and social objectives but also the barriers that exist to effective management. These barriers must be explicitly addressed if the education of U.S. fishery managers is to be effective.","Hanna, Susan",ORESU-R-02-020,ORESU-R-02-020,R/RCF-05,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2002,Oregon Sea Grant,Educating U.S. fishery managers and policy makers: the problem of incentives,NA,NA,"""Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade,"" proceedings, Wellington, New Zealand, August 19-22, 2002.",NA,NA,NA,NOAA Sea Grant

Extensive basic biological information has been collected for this species, which because of their large size relative to other model fish species are particularly suitable for studies requiring ample quantities of specific cells and tissue types. Rainbow trout have been widely utilized for research in carcinogenesis, toxicology, comparative immunology, disease ecology, physiology and nutrition. They are distinctive in having evolved from a relatively recent tetraploid event, resulting in a high incidence of duplicated genes. Natural populations are available and have been well characterized for chromosomal, protein, molecular and quantitative genetic variation. Their ease of culture, and experimental and aquacultural significance has led to the development of clonal lines and the widespread application of transgenic technology to this species. Numerous microsatellites have been isolated and two relatively detailed genetic maps have been developed. Extensive sequencing of expressed sequence tags has begun and four BAC libraries have been developed. The development and analysis of additional genomic sequence data will provide distinctive opportunities to address problems in areas such as evolution of the immune system and duplicate genes.","Thorgaard, Gary H.;Bailey, George S.;Williams, David;Buhler, Donald R.;Kaattari, Stephen L.;Ristow, Sandra S.;Hansen, John D.;Winton, James R.;Bartholomew, Jerri L.;Nagler, James J.;Walsh, Patrick J.;Vijayan, Matt M.;Devlin, Robert H.;Hardy, Ronald W.;Overturf, Kenneth E.;Young, William P.;Robison, Barrie D.;Rexroad, Caird;Palti, Yniv",ORESU-R-02-022,ORESU-R-02-022,R/BT-31,reprints (peer-reviewed),2002,Oregon Sea Grant,Status and opportunities for genomics research with rainbow trout,NA,NA,"""Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part B,"" 133:609-646, 2002.",NA,NA,NA,NOAA Sea Grant

The goal of this study was to investigate the principles involved in the mortality of lingcod ""Ophiodon elongates"" by testing hypotheses concerning the factors that may control trawl bycatch mortality. Lingcod were towed in a net and exposed to increased seawater temperature and to air, two stressors that occur during the processes of trawl capture, retrieval through a thermocline, and landing on deck. Mortality occurred after exposure to more than 45 mm in air, after exposure to 4 h towing in a net followed by more than 30 mm in air, or after 4 h towing followed by exposure to seawater above 16.0 degrees C for 30 mm and air for 15 mm. In treatments of equal stressor intensity, smaller fish (41�51 cm total length) had higher rates of mortality than larger fish (52�67 cm). The effects of net towing and air-- as well as of towing, increased seawater temperature, and air--were additive. Lingcod bycatch mortality may be reduced by decreasing trawling times and exposure to increased seawater and air temperatures during warmer seasons or by restricting fisheries that produce bycatch to seasons of cooler temperatures. The sorting, handling, and release of bycatch on deck after capture may be conducted in a manner that would probably enhance survival if fish are released within 30 mm of capture. Because smaller lingcod had higher rates of mortality, further information about the mortality rates of relevant size-classes of fish is needed to validate the assumptions of management rules for released, undersized bycatch that are designed to enhance recruitment.","Davis, Michael;Olla, Bori",ORESU-R-02-026,ORESU-R-02-026,R/RCF-06;R/RF-06-PD,reprints (peer-reviewed),2002,Oregon Sea Grant,"Mortality of lingcod towed in a net as related to fish length, seawater temperature, and air exposure: a laboratory bycatch study",NA,NA,"""North American Journal of Fisheries Management,"" 22:1095-1104, 2002.",NA,NA,NA,NOAA Sea Grant

Inheritance studies by previous investigators suggested that ""C. hasta"" resistance is genetically controlled,but none have revealed the number and locations of gene regions associated with resistance. Here, the authors characterized differences in resistance among clonal lines, and used line crosses between clonal lines with resistance differences for a genetic analysis of ""C. shasta"" resistance in ""Oncorhynchus mykiss"", following a short term in situ exposure to the pathogen.

Doubled haploids, produced by androgenesis from an F(1) hybrid between the OSU and CW lines, were evaluated for the co-segregation of molecular markers and resistance phenotype. Amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) markers, used to construct a genetic linkage map in this cross, were tested for associations with resistance expressed as absolute survival (binary trait) and days to death (survival analysis). Segregation of the resistance phenotype suggested that the resistance was inherited as a single Mendelian locus, but the binary trait failed to map to a single genomic location.

Managers must account for the mortality of bycatch to assess population status accurately. The authors objectives were to estimate the actual mortality of trawl-discarded lingcod (50-84 cm) and describe their physiological stress response to capture. They investigated three major factors of the trawling operation that may influence lingcod survival: tow duration, fish size, and the amount of time fish were on the deck of the vessel. Survival was monitored for 21 d and each surviving animal was then physically and physiologically evaluated. The results showed that regardless of the duration of the tow, lingcod survival was 100% for animals discarded immediately after the cod end was emptied on deck. All lingcod captured during a tow of average commercial duration demonstrated a maximal stress response, measured by plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate concentrations. As expected, lingcod from an average duration tow showed decreased survival with increased time on deck, though still had 50% survival after 30 mm. This study suggests that discard mortality of lingcod is determined mainly by on-deck sorting and can be minimized by releasing fish quickly upon capture. Accurate estimation of mortality rates for lingcod will depend on the documentation of normal fishing behavior and on-deck sorting procedures.","Parker, Steven J.;Rankin, Polly S.;Hannah, Robert W.;Schreck, Carl B.",ORESU-R-03-026,ORESU-R-03-026,R/RCF-06;R/RCF-06-PD,reprints (peer-reviewed),2003,Oregon Sea Grant,Discard mortality of trawl-caught lingcod in relation to tow duration and time on deck,NA,NA,"""North American Journal of Fisheries Management,"" 23:530-542, 2003.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Addition of the solid (at room temperature) emulsifier, sorbitan monopalmitate (SMP) resulted in higher retention efficiencies compared to the additions of liquid emulsifier sorbitan sesquioleate (SSO). Additions of SMP were found to have a positive effect on retention and delivery efficiencies of LSB at concentrations of 10% and 25% (w/w) of lipid. LSB composed of a mixture of MP+10% SMP+10% ethyl cellulose (EC, w/w) were shown to retain riboflavin with the highest retention efficiencies over a period of 6 h of aqueous suspension. Use of MP facilitated digestive breakdown of LSB by larvae of zebrafish and glowlight tetra as indicated by release of free riboflavin from ingested LSB. There is a need to balance the wall stability of LSB with the digestion requirements of target species. The results suggest that it is possible to formulate a carrier lipid matrix that both retains riboflavin and is digested by fish larvae.

Baffles were first added to produce uniform airflow. Maximum measured freeze times of 12.6 hours fell to 10.5 hours; total electrical energy savings was estimated to be 12%. A Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) was then installed to slow evaporator fans during the freeze cycle. In one example run when fans were slowed to 75% speed after an initial freezing period, freezing times then increased by about an hour while overall energy consumed fell by an additional 10%. Based on the effect of the VFD alone and $0.05/kWh power in this case, payback period would be in the range of 850 freezing cycles. Mathematical models, calibrated by measurements, analyzed further design and fan control options.

To control the flow of upland water into diked estuarine zones or river reaches and to keep estuarine waters from moving upstream, structures known as tide boxes are used. A flood box may be simple or complex, but it involves a culvert running through the dike wall. In all cases, gates, known as tide gates, are attached to the discharge end of the culverts to control the flow of water. The negative ecological consequences of diking and regulating estuarine wetlands with flood boxes and tides gates have received little attention.

Amongst the many findings generated by their literature search, perhaps the most striking is the paucity of studies on community and ecosystem level impacts of NIS zooplankton, especially in marine and estuarine systems. They also present some results from two ongoing studies of invasive zooplankton in the northeast Pacific Ocean -- ""Pseudodiaptomu​s inopinus"" in Washington and Oregon coastal estuaries, and ""Tortanus dextrilobatus"" in San Francisco Bay. Both of these Asian copepods have recently expanded their range and can at times be extremely abundant (10^3m^- 3).

Both real property and structures along the coast have been destroyed and this destruction will continue. In certain instances, it may be feasible to protect property by engineered construction. In an attempt to propose effective methods for stabilization of potential landslides, the landslide problem on the Oregon coast is studied and a general analytical model of the landslide mechanism is presented. By means of the model, the critical factors governing slope stability are determined, applicability of various stabilization methods are assessed and recommendations are made. The northern Oregon coast is composed mainly of Tertiary (2 million to 60 million years old) sedimentary rock with unconformable deposits of Pleistocene (20,000 to 2 million years old) sandstones, siltstones, mudstones and shales which are often exposed in the terraces. The younger weakly cemented sediments are composed mainly of silts and sands with layers of gravel, coarse sand, fossil wood, peat and minor beds of sandy clay. Many coastal landslides have occurred in these latter materials. Headlands are in the main, composed of resistant igneous basalts and andesites of volcanic origin. Figure 1 indicates, in a general way, the geology of the northern Oregon Coast and generally recognized areas where landslides are known to have occurred. South of Heceta Head the coastline is rugged and composed mainly of igneous cliffs and small bays. Between Cape Blanco and Coos Bay the coast borders the Coastal Range where several uplifted marine terraces are found. Narrow sand beaches are found at the base of the cliffs. Resistant igneous headlands are found at Cape Blanco and Cape Arago and smaller headlands occur near the mouth of the Coquille River where the coast is low and backed by stabilized dunes. Large coastal sand dunes of up to 10 meters in height are found between Coos Bay and Heceta Head. Between Heceta Head and the Columbia River there are many uplifted marine terraces forming low cliffs rising from narrow beaches. The terraces are interrupted by several headlands. Both active and stable sand dunes are evident along this stretch of coast. Landsliding is most active in the area north of Heceta Head Rock lithology, structure and stratigraphy have dictated the shape of the coast, its rate of erosion and geomorphic changes. Byrne considers lithology to be the most important factor controlling coastal modification. However, the structural factors such as fractures, bedding attitude, faults and joints are of direct importance to landsliding as well.","Prestedge, Gordon K.",ORESU-Y-77-001,ORESU-Y-77-001,NA,theses/disserta​tions,1977,Oregon Sea Grant,Stabilization of landslides along the Oregon coast,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Oregon State University, Sea Grant",NOAA Sea Grant

Using geographic information systems, the authors modified digital maps of surface geology and topsoils to produce proxy maps of potential dune sheet deposits in Oregon. The distributions of dune deposits were groundtruthed by extensive morphostratigra​phic profiling in the Oregon dune sheets. Dune sheet deposits were previously discriminated and mapped along the coasts of southwestern Washington, California, and Baja California. Representative morphostratigra​phic profiling was completed in this study for the previously published dune units of southwestern Wash- ington, northern and central California, San Miguel Island, and Baja California Sur. In this report the authors compile available radiocarbon dates (248 in number) from coastal dunes and associated archaeological sites in Oregon, northern California, and Baja California Sur. Subsurface profiles are presented from 646 dune sites that were observed in west-to- east transects across the mapped dune sheets. The profiled sites are georeferenced by UTM coordinates and include details on topsoil development, shallow subsurface lithology, paleosols, and groundwater diagenesis. Measured subsurface sections (2-30 m depth) include thickness of dune strata and different interbeds, including loess, peat, and diagenetic hardpans. These morphostratigra​phic profiles provide regional information on dune emplacement age, episodic dune sheet reactivation, and relative duration of dune sheet stabilization. Profile data from some sites address potential variation in geotechnical and hydrogeologic properties of the dune deposits. These preliminary results should be of interest to coastal geomorphologist​s, engineering geologists, hydrologists, and archaeologists.

Certainly one of the most controversial incidents in recent years was the die-off of an estimated 34,000 fish in the Klamath River in September 2002. Although this loss was dramatic because it involved adult fish, the epidemic drew attention to the chronic disease issues that affect the health of migrating juvenile fish. What should be done to improve the health of these fish and insure that such incidents don't recur is a question with consequences for the farmers, fishers, and communities that depend on the river's water in Oregon and California, as well as for the tribes and agencies that manage the river. Fish disease issues in the Klamath River are complicated. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), in its report on the 2002 fish die-off, concluded that a ""combination of factors"" caused it, specifically, ""high density offish, low [river] discharges, warm water temperatures, and possible extended residence time of salmon [which] created optimal conditions for parasite proliferation.""

They illustrate the pressures exerted on tradition in an age of globalization that is characterized by the expansion of markets and the integration of environmental policies. Globalization of environmental policy is affecting fisheries in the recovery of overfished stocks, the vesting of use rights, the protection of biodiversity and the advancement toward ecosystem management. This manuscript focuses on biodiversity protection as an example of the challenges associated with finding an effective blend of tradition and change in an era of globalization and in moving from theory to practice. Marine ecosystems are forms of natural capital that provide value in stocks and flows of goods and services. Goods are used directly as seafood, Pharmaceuticals​, oils and additives. Services are used indirectly through their contribution to ecosystem resilience, genetic diversity, and aesthetic appreciation. Biodiversity can be viewed in a number of dimensions, including the diversity of species, genetic material and functional roles. The capital properties of ecosystems means that biodiversity can be sustained only through maintaining a balance of stocks and flows and ensuring healthy ecosystem functions. Restoring marine ecosystem biodiversity is an internationally recognized need. This restoration will require increased biological knowledge, but it will also require a much better understanding of human behavior, particularly in fisheries, the main extractive use. Restoring and maintaining biodiversity is ultimately a problem of controlling human use, and is therefore a problem of common property resource management. It is also an area in which tradition and globalization are in tension.","Hanna, Susan",ORESU-R-01-014,ORESU-R-01-014,R/RCF-05,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2001,Oregon Sea Grant,Tradition and globalization common property in theory and practice: the example of biodiversity protection in fisheries,NA,NA,"""Proceedings of the First Pacific Regional Meeting of the International Association for the Study of Common Property (IASCP),"" Brisbane, Australia, September 2-4, 2001.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The maximum temperature difference between the center and the edge of the heated samples was less than 3 deg C during heating. Results show that system impedance is temperature-​sensitive. For heating foods, a CDH system with automated impedance control is essential for achieving maximum heating rates with minimum power. To avoid arcing and heating run- away, optimization of electrode configurations, cavity design and configuration of food packages has to be achieved.","Ling, Q.;Zhao, Y.;Kolbe, E.;Wells, J.

This Oregon Game Commission project was an experiment in bioengineering, an attempt to transform Lint Slough into a productive rearing pond for juvenile salmon. With the aim of enhancing salmon growth, a system of canals and dams was designed to carefully regulate the mix of fresh water and salt water in the slough and to trap upwelled ocean nutrients. Biologists hoped that Lint Slough would produce ""super fish"" that could grow to a smolt size ready to migrate to the ocean within a few months, a feat that some salmon require more than a year of natural rearing to achieve. Moreover, as one salmon booster put it, if the natural rearing habitats of salmon can't be protected, then why not create a fish that doesn't need them? Why do salmon have to climb over dams and swim to the top of the Rockies to spawn? Why not raise salmon where they are protected from hazards such as pollution, dams, predators like birds, otter, bear, and man; where disease can be controlled; where drought, logging, destruction of spawning beds can't occur; and where growth can be controlled and even increased tremendously?","Bottom, Daniel L.;Simenstad, Charles A.",ORESU-R-01-022,ORESU-R-01-022,R/ECO-02;R/ECO-02-PD,reprints (peer-reviewed),2001,Oregon Sea Grant,"Bottlenecks, barges, and super fish: rethinking conservation of estuaries and salmon (The Lint Slough Experiment)",NA,NA,"""Oregon Salmon: Essays on the State of the Fish at the Turn of the Millennium,"" Oregon Trout, Portland, Oregon, pp. 87-95, 2001.",NA,NA,NA,NA

This study also discusses the marketing potential and biochemical properties of the respective fish sauces. Marketing potential for Pacific whiting fish sauce in the United States was evaluated through phone interview and consumer panels. Fish sauce import reached $16.6 million in the United States in 2000. Anchovy was the most popular raw material used (47%) in the fish sauce process and brand name was the most important factor in the purchase decision (52%). Consumer tests disclosed no significant difference in flavor acceptance and overall acceptance among fish sauce W, fish sauce WB, and commercial anchovy fish sauce (P> 0.05). As fermentation time increased, the degree of hydrolysis increased and higher total nitrogen and total amino acid contents were obtained; however, moisture content and pH decreased. Glutamic acid, alanine, leucine, lysine, and arginine were abundant after 9 months fermentation and accounted for 43.27% and 54.08% of total amino acids in fish sauce W and WB, respectively. Fish sauce W had a total amino acid concentration of 38.4 mg per ml, which was twice as much as WB fish sauce (16.6 mg per ml). Based on positive consumer acceptance, good quality, and low cost, it was concluded that fish sauce from Pacific whiting had potential to replace imported anchovy fish sauce (which contains histamine).","Tungkawachara, S.;Park, J.

If achieving the objectives of the Magnuson-​Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires managing people, a critical intervention point for improving management effectiveness is where the involvement of people is the greatest - the regional fishery management councils. The regional fishery management council system is under strain. Since the inception of federal fishery management in 1977, fisheries have undergone development and growth, stress and decline. Management problems have been caused by the race for fish, a short- term perspective, an over-investment in fishing capital and an under-​investment in the information base of management. Pressures for improving management performance are growing, evidenced in part by the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act and by the large number of lawsuits contesting federal management decisions (Botsford et al 1997; Restrepo et al. 1998; Ecosystems Principles Advisory Panel 1999; Heinz Center 2000; National Academy of Public Administration 2002.) In failing to address the race for fish, the problem of overcapacity, and the need to manage for long-term productivity, management through the regional council system has become increasingly complex and costly. Losses in biological and economic productivity have required more complicated regulations, expanded requirements for information, and created more conflicts among user groups. In turn, these factors have increased management costs while undermining management legitimacy and effectiveness (Hanna 1997; 1998). The Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) introduced much stricter standards for the protection of fish populations and their habitat. But the SFA did little to address the fundamental economic problems that continue to plague fisheries. Fishery management under the council system has been conducted, for the most part, in avoidance of the fundamental economic problems facing fisheries. Many fisheries are managed under regulations that still promote a race for fish, with incentives that are incompatible with long-term sustainability. Fisheries are almost universally overcapitalized​. Economic data and analysis are inadequate to the information required. Management costs are high. Each of these problems diminishes the effectiveness of management (Iudicello et al 1999; Heinz Center 2000.)","Hanna, Susan S.",ORESU-R-02-021,ORESU-R-02-021,R/RCF-05,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2002,Oregon Sea Grant,Improving effectiveness of the regional fishery management councils,NA,NA,"""Proceedings of the Workshop on Improving Regional Ocean Governance in the United States,"" Biliana Cicin-Sain, et al, eds., pp. 97-100, Washington DC, December 9, 2002.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Natural infections by C. shasta are known to occur in several species of Salmonidae (Table 1) in the Pacific Northwest of North America and Canada. However, within a species, strains of salmonids originating from enzootic waters are often more resistant compared with strains from non-enzootic locations. This virulent parasite primarily invades the posterior intestinal tract of susceptible salmon and trout, triggering an acute inflammatory reaction involving polymorphonucle​ar leukocytes (PMN's), fibroblasts, and macrophages. The epithelial lining necrotizes, fragments, and ultimately sloughs, and is replaced by fibrous connective tissue containing host cells and parasite trophozoites. The lumen may contain epithelial cells, epithelial cell fragments, PMN's, fibroblasts and different parasite stages (Bartholomew et al. 1989b). Although infection is commonly detected first in the posterior intestine, as the trophozoite stages of C. shasta proliferate the infection spreads to other organs and eventually becomes systemic. Death of the host may be a direct result of damage by the parasite or may result from secondary invasion in the damaged tissue.","Palenzuela, Oswaldo;Bartholomew, Jerri L.",ORESU-R-02-024,ORESU-R-02-024,R/FSD-26,reprints (peer-reviewed),2002,Oregon Sea Grant,"Molecular tools for the diagnosis of ""Ceratomyxa shasta"" (Myxozoa)",NA,NA,"""Molecular Diagnosis of Salmonid Diseases,"" C.

Increasing settlement of coastal margins is expanding the intensity and variety of human uses of coastal resources. The number of nonhuman claimants to coastal resources is also growing as protection of fur animal, marine bird and marine mammal populations is implemented. Problems facing coastal zones extend inland to watersheds through the important connection of estuaries. These coastal, estuarine and watershed problems are institutional, with biophysical and economic symptoms. This paper illustrates the role of historical paths and problems of redirection in institutions for coastal zone management. The focus is on salmon in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, which are both an integrating and polarizing presence throughout coastal zones and watersheds. Anadromous salmon traverse both watersheds and coastal zones in the course of their life histories as they migrate from rivers to oceans, and then back to freshwater natal streams to spawn. In ecological terms, they serve as the integrators of riverine and coastal ecosystems. The Columbia River Basin and the coastal ocean of Oregon and Washington provide excellent examples of the importance of historical development paths, the expanding connectivity between coastal zones and watershed, the increasing number of interests, and the contradiction between the present institutional environment and that needed to achieve coastal zone sustainability.","Hanna, Susan",ORESU-R-03-021,ORESU-R-03-021,A/RCF-10,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2003,Oregon Sea Grant,Institutional evolution in coastal zones: historical paths and contemporary redirection,NA,NA,"""Proceedings of the Conference on Rights and Duties in the Coastal Zone: a Multidisciplina​ry Scientific Conference on Sustainable Coastal Zone Management,"" Stockholm, Sweden, June 12-14, 2003.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Among these important benefits are the transport of large wood, fine organic material, nutrients, sediment, water, and thermal energy to the stream network, such that a natural aquatic environment is maintained. Alterations to riparian vegetation can alter or disrupt these watershed processes, which affect instream parameters such as stream productivity and the abundance of desirable fishes (Swanson and Lienkaemper 1978; Bisson et al. 1987; Lienkaemper and Swanson 1987). Riparian forest conditions largely determine instream conditions. Riparian areas also are a necessary habitat component for many wildlife species (Kondolf et al. 1987; Raedeke 1988). The loss of riparian habitat throughout much of North America and elsewhere is extensive, but the number of successful efforts to restore these systems is growing (Boldt et al. 1979; GAO 1988; Mutz 1989; BLM 1991; NRC 1992; Kattelman and Embury 1996; Wissmar and Beschta 1998). Riparian restoration describes a suite of restorative management techniques that can alter forest development in riparian areas for the purpose of improving instream and riparian habitat conditions (Oliver and Hinckley 1987; Berg 1990, 1995; Kohm and Franklin 1997). Monitoring the effectiveness of these restoration actions requires measuring the response of vegetation in the riparian areas, as well as measuring the physical responses (e.g., stream channels, fish habitat, temperature) and biological responses (e.g., primary production, macroinverterbr​ates, fishes). Several guidelines for determining what and how to monitor specific instream parameters have been published (MacDonald et al. 1991; Bauer and Ralph 1999; Kaufmann et al. 1999), but aspects of monitoring design for restoration of riparian areas have not been well developed, and consistent criteria for determining the success of riparian restoration efforts are lacking. In particular, there has been little analysis of riparian silvicultural treatments on forest conditions and how those changes affect instream habitat (Beechie et al. 2000).

Mark-recapture studies and abundance patterns in the estuary during 2000-2002 describe the following life- history types among Chinook salmon: (1) fry disperse throughout the estuary, and many move into restored tidal- marsh habitats in the early spring soon after emergence; (2) juveniles reside in freshwater for several months, enter the estuary in June or July, and remain for (a) a few weeks or (b) several months before entering the ocean; and (3) juveniles enter the ocean later in the fall after an extended period of rearing upriver and/or in the estuary. The absence of fry migrants in the estuary during spring and early summer in 1975-1977 - a period that precedes restoration of any of the diked marshes - and the extensive use of marsh habitats by fry and fingerlings April-July, 2000-2002 indicate that wetland restoration has increased estuarine rearing opportunities for juvenile Chinook salmon. Year-to-year patterns of estuarine rearing and abundance by juvenile salmon may be influenced by flood and drought conditions that affected adult spawner distribution and over-winter survival of salmon eggs. However, persistent changes in spawner distribution since 1975-1977, including the concentration of hatchery strays in the lower river, may account for the large proportion of fry that now disperse into the estuary soon after emergence in the spring. Although few of these earliest migrants survived to the river mouth, many fry and fingerlings from mid- and upper-basin spawning areas distributed throughout a greater portion of the estuary during the spring and summer and migrated to the ocean over a broader range of sizes and time periods than thirty years ago.

Using eubacterial primers, we amplified 16S rRNA genes from environmental DNA and analyzed the PCR products by length heterogeneity polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR), which discriminates products based on naturally occurring length differences. Analysis of LH-PCR profiles by multivariate ordination methods revealed differences in community composition along the estuarine gradient that were correlated with changes in environmental variables. Microbial community differences were also detected among different rivers. Using partial 16S rRNA sequences, we identified members of dominant or unique gene fragment size classes distributed along the estuarine gradient. Gammaproteobact​eria and Betaproteobacte​ria and members of the Bacteroidetes dominated in freshwater samples, while Alphaproteobact​eria, Cyanobacteria and chloroplast genes dominated in marine samples. Changes in the microbial communities correlated most strongly with salinity and dissolved silicon, but were also strongly correlated with precipitation. We also identified specific gene fragments that were correlated with inorganic nutrients. Our data suggest that there is a significant and predictable change in microbial species composition along an estuarine gradient, shifting from a more complex community structure in freshwater habitats to a community more typical of open ocean samples in the marine-​influenced sites. We also demonstrate the resolution and power of LH-PCR and multivariate analyses to provide a rapid assessment of major community shifts, and show how these shifts correlate with environmental variables.","Bernhard, Anne E.;Colbert, Debbie;McManus, James;Field, Katharine G.",ORESU-R-05-011,ORESU-R-05-011,R/ECO-04,reprints (peer-reviewed),2005,Oregon Sea Grant,Microbial community dynamics based on 16S rRNA gene profiles in a Pacific Northwest estuary and its tributaries,NA,NA,"""FEMS Microbiology Ecology,"" 52(1):115-128, March 2005.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Target host rRNA gene fragments were hybridized to subtracter rRNA gene fragments immobilized in a microplate well, and target sequences that did not hybridize were cloned and sequenced for PCR primer design. The use of microplates for DNA immobilization resulted in a one-step subtractive hybridization in which the products could be directly amplified with PCR.

We analyzed Bacteroidales 16S rRNA gene sequences from the feces of eight hosts: human, bovine, pig, horse, dog, cat, gull, and elk. Recovered sequences did not match database sequences, indicating high levels of uncultivated diversity. The analysis revealed both endemic and cosmopolitan distributions among the eight hosts. Ruminant, pig, and horse sequences tended to form host- or host group-specific clusters in a phylogenetic tree, while human, dog, cat, and gull sequences clustered together almost exclusively. Many of the human, dog, cat, and gull sequences fell within a large branch containing cultivated species from the genus Bacteroides. Most of the cultivated Bacteroides species had very close matches with multiple hosts and thus may not be useful targets for fecal source identification. A large branch containing cultivated members of the genus Prevotella included cloned sequences that were not closely related to cultivated Prevotella species. Most ruminant sequences formed clusters separate from the branches containing Bacteroides and Prevotella species. Host-specific sequences were identified for pigs and horses and were used to design PCR primers to identify pig and horse sources of fecal pollution in water. The primers successfully amplified fecal DNAs from their target hosts and did not amplify fecal DNAs from other species.

This invader was first discovered in San Francisco Bay almost a decade earlier and by 1995 it had spread to northern California. The coast-wide colonization event we studied in 1998 (El Nino cohort) was correlated with unusually strong north flowing coastal currents from September 1997 to April 1998. Larval transport by ocean currents from established populations to the south appeared to be the mechanism for the colonization. Crabs from the 1998-year class grew faster than counterparts from Maine and Europe, averaging 14mm in carapace width in June, and 46mm by September 1998. By the end of their second summer, males ranged from 52 to 80 mm in carapace width, and by fall of 2000 some males attained a carapace width of over 90 mm. The life span for C. maenas in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia is estimated to be similar as in Europe and Maine: 4-6 years. Even though the initial colonists (98- year class) are dying of senescence, and coastal currents have not been favorable for larval transport from source populations in California, green crabs do persist in Oregon and Washington estuaries.

The gene order is 5'B-y2-y13'. The production and processing of the b1, y2 and y1 polypeptides were studied by both in vitro translation and bacterial expression of the A segment coding region with various deletions. Virus-specific polypeptides were identified with antisera which were specific for groups of the viral proteins. The bacterial expression of these proteins for use as a subunit vaccine is also described. In both the bacterial expression and in vitro translation systems, truncated polyproteins were produced that provided evidence of a polyprotein precursor in the production of the b1, y1 and y2 proteins. Since the truncated polyproteins were produced when deletions were made to the y2 gene, the y2 protein was implicated as a virus-specific protease responsible for the polyprotein processing. The putative protease activity of the y2 protein was not found to act in trans and specific antisera to it did not inhibit its activity in in vitro translation reactions. In the in vitro translation system, internal initiations of translation were demonstrated for the y2 and y1 proteins. Therefore, internal initiations of translation may be an alternative mechanism for the production of these proteins. The A Segment products were expressed in bacteria as a fusion with the TrpE gene and used in a preliminary trial as an immersion vaccine for rainbow trout fry.

The red alga Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis yielded three categories of compounds which included ten oxylipins, three unprecedented galactolipids and two novel pyrroles. The major oxylipin, 12(R), 13(S)-diHEPE, is an inhibitor of progesterone production in the sheep corpus luteum and appears to be the product of a hydroperoxide isomerase which acts on 12(S)-HPETE. The three galactolipids are the first example of MGDAG and DGDAG with specifically oxidized acyl groups, which indicates that this form of galactolipids may serve as either the storage of 12(R), 13(S)-diHEPE or the products of a lipoxygenase system that use eicosapentaenoi​c acid-containing galactolipids as substrates. The red alga Polyneura latissima produces five eicosanoids. Unlike the red algae G. lemaneiformis, Murrayella periclados and Constantinea simplex, which contain 12-lipoxygenase systems, Polyneura latissima may contain a 9-lipoxygenase system as indicated by the oxygenation pattern of the isolated eicosanoids. The eicosanoid chemistry of another red alga Rhodymenia pertusa is different from all others.

In general, strain values decreased substantially over time, however, freeze-dried surimi kept in the freezer at -18 deg C did not change during 9 months of storage. Overall, color decreased during storage and b* values of the freeze-dried surimi kept at room temperature increased significantly. Salt extractable proteins decreased while dimethylamine increased.

Temperatures along the eastern boundary of South America were 6-8 deg C cooler during the LGM than at present and have varied by as much as 10 deg C over the past 150,000 years. A likely source of ice-age cooling along the eastern boundary is an increase in the strength and a corresponding decrease in the temperature of water advected northward in the Peru Current. Evidence for this mechanism of cooling comes from incursion of subpolar foraminiferal species northward into the eastern Pacific during the LGM. We infer from this change in the fauna and decreased temperatures that stronger northward advection of eastern boundary current (EBC) waters was influential in driving cooling of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (EEP) during the LGM. The 150,000-year SST records from the Nazca Rise further reveal that changes in the strength of the Peru Current have influenced temperatures in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific on glacial-​interglacial timescales. The effects of changes in the eastern boundary current on EEP temperatures are evaluated using a simple heat budget model in which equatorial SSTs are predicted from Peru Current temperatures. Variations in EBC temperatures account for about one third of the variability in equatorial SSTs. The remaining variance near the equator is probably associated with local wind-driven upwelling and is linked to the orbital cycles. We infer from this model that temperature changes in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific reflect both a direct response of equatorial upwelling to insolation and changes in eastern boundary current advection.","Feldberg, Melissa J.",ORESU-X-00-008,ORESU-X-00-008,E/INT-34,theses/disserta​tions,2000,Oregon Sea Grant,Late Pleistocene changes in the Peru Current based on planktonic foraminifera (thesis abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While there is general consensus that quality can be improved for many seafood products, there is little agreement on the types and levels of characteristics that should define ""quality."" This is a fundamental problem in the Pacific whiting and albacore tuna industries that indicates a need to comprehensively evaluate species-​specific quality characteristics​, develop appropriate quality standards, and expand and diversify market opportunities. Quality systems employing appropriate handling and chilling techniques to control time-​temperature parameters immediately after harvest and continuing through production and distribution may minimize the negative quality characteristics associated with Pacific whiting and albacore tuna products. There are, however, several issues to consider including identifying key quality product attributes, determining handling and chilling techniques, and evaluating implementation costs. The first paper in this thesis examines how alternative handling techniques, chilling methods, and chemical and sensory qualities impact market buyers' preferences. The second paper evaluates the potential demand for improved product handling and chilling quality systems for each industry. A marketing survey, which accompanied product samples, was designed and mailed to participants from different sectors of the Pacific whiting and albacore tuna industries. Multiple linear regression and truncated tobit analysis were used to determine the response to products handled under different quality systems, and cluster analysis was used to segment the market. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed to examine the differences among actual product groups based on chemical tests and desirability of product characteristics​. The results indicated a demand for products with improved quality characteristics for both species. The analysis identified two market segments: one group was satisfied with traditional product quality levels; the second group demonstrated higher relative demand for improved product handling and chilling methods. These differences were attributed to industry sector, species and product forms handled by the firm, respondent's experience in the seafood industry, and geographic location. This research supports the premise that value added products processed from properly handled and chilled raw material may command higher prices if targeted to specific market segments. This information is critical if industry is to develop and integrate production, quality, and marketing strategies that increase profits, reduce risk, and achieve overall firm-level and industry objectives.","Greene, Elizabeth",ORESU-X-00-010,ORESU-X-00-010,R/SF-17,theses/disserta​tions,2000,Oregon Sea Grant,"A comprehensive evaluation of product quality in the Pacific whiting (""Merluccius productus"") and albacore tuna (""Thunnus alalunga"") industries (thesis abstract)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cascadia tsunami deposits have been reported for many coseismic subsidence events in bay marsh settings where tidal-channel features focus tsunami energy. Variable magnitude (8.5 +/-0.5 Mw), frequency (500 +/-300 yr recurrence), and rupture geometry produce widely varying computer model outcomes for Cascadia tsunami inundation. The results presented in this thesis provide specific quantitative data regarding tsunami inundation at the open coast. Anomalous sand sheets that have been characterized consist of well-sorted beach sand that fine up-section. The thickness of the deposits vary from 45 cm to .2 cm, and thin in the landward direction. Many of the sand layers include detrital caps. One to three detritus and mud lamina are intra-layered in the deposits. Marine diatoms and bromine, a marine tracer, increase in concentration at each of the sand layers. C14 dating of select layers suggest correlation to great Cascadia, earthquake-​induced, coseismic subsidence events. The sand layers are inferred to be tsunami deposited, synchronous with coseismic subsidence events. Core traverses record four, and in some cases up to seven Cascadia tsunami events. One sand layer found at many sites is dated at 600-950 cal YBP, an age that lacks a recognized coseismic horizon in the northern Cascadia margin. Soil chronosequencin​g and dated subsurface erosional scarps have been used to constrain paleo-dune elevation and shoreline position. Minimum paleo-dune height ranges from 5 to 8 m. Minimum overland inundation distance at the various sites ranges from 0.3 to 1.3 km +/- .2 km. The tsunami origins of landward-most sand laminae are tested by marine diatom and bromine anomalies.

Xenobiotics can interfere with the immune system at several levels of complexity, and different immune cells and processes have variable sensitivity to pollutants. For this reason, a suite of tests is required to evaluate immunomodulator​y mechanisms. In this thesis, I formulated and calibrated an assay for the detection of humoral immunity for chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Subsequently, I used this technique in conjunction with other immune and endocrine assays to detect effects of embryonic exposure to o,p'-DDE, a known environmental estrogen. The technique combines exposure of whole animals or leukocyte cultures to immunomodulator​y agents/conditio​ns with in vitro mitogenic activation of B-lymphocytes. The proportion of leukocytes undergoing blastogenesis following in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccari​de (LPS) was quantified by flow cytometric analysis of forward and side scatter properties. In addition, I used a fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled anti-rainbow trout surface immunoglobin monoclonal antibody (anti-RBT SIgM-FITC) to determine the ability of the lymphoblasts to express surface immunoglobin (SIgM) through flow cytometry. I used the assay to evaluate the effects of short-term exposures to o,p'-DDE during early life history stages on the long-term immune competence of fall chinook salmon. Immersion of chinook salmon eggs in 10 ppm o,p'-DDE for 1 h at fertilization followed by 2 h at hatch caused significant reductions in the ability of splenic leukocytes to undergo blastogenesis and express SIgM upon in vitro stimulation with LPS one year after treatment (ANOVA, P<0.05). The concentration of o,p'-DDE in fry treated with 10 ppm o,p'-DDE was 0.92 (ug g^-1 lipid one month post first feeding. The chemical persisted through development and, one year after exposure, levels in juvenile muscle tissue were 0.94 ug g^-1 lipid. Mortality rate, time to hatch, fish size, sex ratios, gonadal development, plasma estradiol and 11- ketotestosteron​e concentrations were not affected by treatment with o,p'-DDE. In addition, neither plasma lysozyme concentration, nor mitogenic response of splenic leukocytes to concanavallin A or polyinosinic-​polycytidylic acid were influenced by the treatment.

The main hindrance in this commercial chitosan application has been its low cost effectiveness. The hypothesis in our research is that chitosan complexes with natural polyanions is more effective than chitosan alone, particularly in recovering low concentration proteins from food processing wastewater. Chitosan (Chi) was reacted with alginate (Alg), pectin (Pec) and carrageenan (Car) ex-situ to obtain chitosan-​polyanion complexes (Chi-Pol). Analysis by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed electrostatic interactions as the mechanism for complex formation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a tight, non-porous structure except for the porous Chi-Car complex. Tests with bovine serum albumin solution revealed low adsorption rates with slightly higher values for Chi-Gar suggesting the need for an improved complexation method. Chi-Pol complexes prepared in-situ at different monomeric weight ratios (MR) were evaluated using pH 6 adjusted Cheddar cheese whey and surimi wastewater (SWW). Complexes used at 30 mg complex/L whey showed higher turbidity reductions than at 10 mg/L. MR had no significant effect on turbidity reduction except for Chi-Alg at 30 mg/L; the value (72%) at MR = 0.2 was higher than for MR = 0.8. UV- Vis spectroscopy confirmed in-situ complex formation with a preference for the adsorption of specific whey protein fractions. Complexes formed at 0.2 and 0.8 MR were evaluated at two concentrations for the treatment of SWW. Tests at 50 mg/L showed a turbidity reduction of up to 97% at 24 h with a 81-90% recovery of SWW proteins. At 150 mg/L, similar efficacy was achieved in only 1 h with turbidity reductions ranging 94-99% and 78-94% protein recovery. FTIR analyses confirmed the adsorption of proteins as indicated by similarities in the three amide bands for Chi-Alg recovered solids and untreated SWW. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to study interactions of SWW proteins and Chi-Alg complexes. Untreated and complex bound SWW proteins revealed single exothermic peaks at 23.3 and 38.0 deg C, respectively.

Despite efforts to minimize fecal input to coastal waters, the problem persists, partly due to the inability to reliably identify nonpoint sources. We describe a new PCR assay to differentiate sources of fecal contamination in coastal waters. We identified 7 host-specific genetic markers derived from human and cow fecal samples by amplifying 16S rDNA fragments from Bifidobacterium and the Bacteroides-​Prevotella group and analyzing them by Length Heterogeneity Polymerase Chain Reaction (LH-PCR) and Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisrn (T-RFLP). Host-specific patterns suggested species composition differences in Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides-​Prevotella populations of human and cow feces. The patterns were highly reproducible among different hosts of the same species. Ease of detection and longer survival in water made Bacteroides-​Prevotella better than Bifidobacterium as indicators, Using cloning and sequencing techniques, we recovered fecal 16S rDNA sequences corresponding to our Bacterpides-​Prevotella markers, none of which matched published Bacteroides or Prevotella sequences exactly. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences placed them into three host-specific gene clusters within the Cytophaga- Flavobacter-​Bacteroides division. 16S rDNA clones from coastal waters recovered with the same Bacteroides-​Prevotella primers clustered with fecal sequences, but did not match them exactly. From the sequence data, we designed PCR primers specific for each gene cluster. To determine host specificity of the markers, we tested fecal samples from other animals for the presence of the genetic markers. Markers derived from human feces were not detected in any non-human sources. Cow-derived fecal markers were detected in all other ruminants tested. Using the source-specific primers, we surveyed water samples from Tillamook Bay, Oregon and its tributaries from June 1998 to April 1999. In most cases, only areas near sewage treatment facilities and outfalls tested positive for human pollution. Fecal pollution from ruminant sources was more widely distributed in the bay and rivers.

In addition, biosynthetic investigations were undertaken using stable isotope-labeled precursors. The dominant role that NMR spectroscopy plays in the field of natural products chemistry has led to the development of several novel pulse sequences. Hectochlorin was discovered during a phytochemical investigation of a cultured L. majuscula originally collected off the coast of the Caribbean Island, Jamaica. The absolute stereochemistry was determined by X-ray crystallography​. Through a series of biological evaluations, this compound was found to stimulate actin polymerization. The jamaicamide class of compound was isolated from the same organism that yielded hectochlorin. The structures were elucidated utilizing a variety of NMR methods, including a newly developed pulse sequence. Because the producing organism was in culture, a biosynthetic pathway investigation ensued to elucidate the carbon framework in jamaicamide A. The marine natural product barbamide is intriguing due to the incorporation of a trichloromethyl group into its molecular constitution. Further investigation into the timing of the chlorination reaction has been pursued. In addition, the isolation of dechlorobarbami​de and the determination of the absolute stereochemistry assignment of barbamide was accomplished. A reevaluation of the stereochemistry of antillatoxin necessitated a correction in the original assignment. Four antillatoxin stereoisomers were obtained from a collaborator and found to possess differing levels of biological activity. The three dimensional solution structures of these isomers were evaluated in an effort to understand the role these stereochemical features play in the observed bioactivity. The structures were determined utilizing NMR-derived constraints applied to molecular modeling calculations.

Two new thiazole-​containing cyclic heptapeptides, cis,cis- and trans,trans-​ceratospongamid​e, were identified from an Indonesian red alga, Ceratodictyon spongiosum Zanardini. These are a pair of stable conformers differing only in the conformation of two proline amide bonds. The trans,trans-​form was revealed to be a potent anti-​inflammatory agent in the inhibition of sPLA2 expression in a cell-based model. The hermitamides are new malyngamide-​type molecules isolated from a collection of the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula Gomont made in Papua New Guinea. The semi-syntheses of these natural metabolites were achieved by coupling the free-occurring C-14 lyngbic acid isolated from the microalga and the commercially available aromatic amines. Two new semi-synthetic molecules, the N-methylated derivatives of the hermitamides, were also prepared. The biological properties of the hermitamides and synthetic derivatives were evaluated in several bioassays.

One method looked at the breakage of the shrimp by finfish bycatch in the nets. The other looked at the impact of bycatch on fishing decisions. At-sea research found that finfish bycatch contributes to the breakage of ocean shrimp. However, the impact is small relative to breakage caused by other handling procedures. Bycatch was measured from each net of a double-rigged shrimp vessel, where one side employed a Nordmore grate bycatch reduction device (BRD) and the other served as a control. Shrimp catch was controlled for BRD use and catch day, and sampled throughout processing to evaluate breakage. At greater than 50% bycatch there was a significantly higher percentage of broken shrimp in the control side than in the BRD side for samples taken at the first and third sampling point (p<0.05). After this point the differences became non-​significant. The percent breakage increased from a mean 2.4% broken before placement in the hold to a mean 18.0% broken in the final product. The impact of bycatch on fishing decisions was evaluated by distributing an expanded logbook to volunteer Oregon shrimp vessels in 1998. Logbook questions addressed the reasons and time involved for running to initial fishing grounds, relocating overnight, relocating between tows, dumping tows, and modifying gear. Completed logbooks were collected from 20 vessels representing 263 trips, 1043 fishing days, and 4727 tows. A soft mesh BRD was used at some point by 25% of vessels on 8.7% of trips and 3.3% of tows. Bycatch did not figure prominently in reasons given for choice of initial fishing grounds, relocating between fishing days, or relocating between tows. Bycatch was the main reason cited for dumping tows. In total, 430 (9%) tows were dumped. The estimated weight offish and shrimp dumped equaled 11.3% and 0.3%, respectively, of the landed shrimp catch. Pacific whiting Merluccius productus caused 81.4% of the tows dumped due to bycatch. Opportunity costs attributed to bycatch alone were equivalent to net revenue resulting from 12.3 tows or $3,203 per study vessel.

These landscape resource features are included in the modeling project as independent variables. The dependant variable in this modeling project is relative probability that an area will contain archaeological materials dating to the time period of interest. Two predictive locational models are created to facilitate the search process. These models mathematically combine the independent variables using two separate approaches. The hierarchical decision rule model approach assumes that decision makers in the past would have viewed landscape features sequentially rather than simultaneously. The additive, or weighted value, approach assumes that a number of conditional preference aspects were evaluated simultaneously and that different environmental variables had varying amounts of influence on the locational choices of prehistoric peoples. Integration of the data and mathematical model structures into a Geographic Information System (GIS) allows for spatial analysis of the landscape and the prediction of locations most likely to contain evidence of human activity dating to 15,000 years ago.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/6021445_3144_2816158.csv,3,"These three papers address uncertainty in the management and valuation of renewable natural resources. The first paper develops a model to integrate both stock and price uncertainty to obtain optimal resource levels. The model is an extension of Reed (1974) and shows by proof and by example that when prices can fall below costs, considering stochastic prices is an important element of resource management. The second paper considers the valuation of a United States Forest Service timber harvest contract. The tools and methods of mathematical finance are applied to a timber contract auction to obtain an arbitrage free minimum bid. These methods provide managers with an objective measure to integrate the effects of interest rates, costs, price volatility and contract duration into the contract bid. The third paper fine tunes the exploration of arbitrage-free valuation of natural resource contracts. The paper shows that traditional market-based instruments are not sufficient to hedge contracts on undeveloped resources, such as standing trees in the case of the Forest Service. Rather, a market-based valuation proxy for the undeveloped resource must be obtained. The contribution of this approach is that it shows the consistency of financial theory for use with non-market assets. Also, the results provide a framework within which convenience yield measures for holding the developed, or marketable asset, may be determined. This is important because failure to account for convenience yields results in arbitrage opportunities leaving the contract writer exposed to risk from price fluctuations. These papers offer resource managers the rationale and tools for integrating price uncertainty into management plans. They suggest that under uncertainty, harvest levels should be more conservative when prices can fall below harvest costs, and that contract values should be adjusted to accommodate the writer's exposure to lost revenue.","Burnes, Ellen Irene",ORESU-X-01-012,ORESU-X-01-012,R/OPF-48,theses/disserta​tions,2001,Oregon Sea Grant,Three studies on the role of uncertainty in the valuation and management of renewable natural resources (dissertation abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Highest retention efficiencies (RE) and delivery efficiencies (DE) were achieved by LSB composed of 100% MS. RE and DE of LSB were further improved when glycine was encapsulated as aqueous droplets rather than in a particulate form. The overall performance of LSB containing tyrosine showed that nutrients with similar water-​solubilities to tyrosine can be very effectively delivered to early fish larvae. Visual observation indicated that LSB composed of 100% MS were broken down by larvae of clownfish, Amphiprion percula. Zein-bound particles (ZBP) were not efficient in delivering riboflavin to fish larvae due to high leaching rates. In an attempt to improve ZBP, we developed complex particles (CP) containing LSB incorporated in a dietary mixture bound by zein, to obtain a single particle type. The potential of LSB for delivery of free amino acids (FAA) was evaluated when LSB were incorporated within CP. RE and DE for tyrosine were significantly greater than those for alanine, glycine and serine. There was a significant inverse correlation between RE for FAA and their solubilities where FAA with low solubilities resulted in higher RE. Development of CP with high RE and DE for amino acids is an important step towards formulating a diet to allow early weaning offish larvae onto artificial diets.","Onal, Umur",ORESU-X-02-003,ORESU-X-02-003,R/SAq-​04-​NSI-​NMAI,theses/disserta​tions,2002,Oregon Sea Grant,Development of artificial diets for delivery of water- soluble nutrients to altricial fish larvae (dissertation abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The dose absorbed increased up to 2 cm and then it gradually decreased, reaching a minimum at 5 cm depth of surimi seafood. It was determined that one and two-sided e-beam can efficiently penetrate 3.3 and 8.2 cm of surimi seafood, respectively.

The z-value for thermally inactivated S. aureus between 55-95 deg C was not linear. Thermal processing degraded texture and color of surimi seafood. E-beam enhanced firmness and decreased the b* value of surimi seafood. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) degraded proportionally to the e-beam dose.

The highest breaking force was measured from fish proteins treated at pH 11, while high deformation values were obtained at pH 2 and 11. Texture of gels made using the conventional method were quite inferior to gels made using fish proteins treated at pH 2 or 11, while color of conventional gels was significantly better than the other treatments. SDS-PAGE revealed that fish proteins were highly denatured during acid or alkali treatment. High cathepsin B-like activity was detected from acid-aided fish proteins. Strong cathepsin L-like activity was found in fish proteins treated at pH 10.5, which corresponded with the lower breaking force and deformation obtained from those samples. Disulfide bonds contributed to high texture value in fish proteins treated at pH 11. Physicochemical characteristics of sarcoplasmic proteins (SP) from rockfish and their interaction with Alaska pollock surimi (myofibrillar proteins) were investigated. Solubility of SP was significantly suppressed at acidic pH (2-4) plus high salt concentration (0.5 M NaCl). This was also supported by SDS-PAGE results (extensively degraded SP). DSC results revealed SP gave three endothermic transitions. The least amount of proteins was lost when treated at pH 2 or 3 followed by precipitation at pH 5.5. SP did not enhance the gelation properties of myofibrillar proteins, but positively contributed to gelation with myofibrillar proteins when compared to sucrose. Myofibrillar proteins were primary components contributing to heat-induced gelation. Salt effect on acid- or alkali-treated surimi gel was investigated. Good gels were obtained without salt using acid- and alkali-treated fish proteins. Their texture properties decreased as NaCl content increased, unlike conventional surimi gels. Consequently, NaCl did not solubilize myofibrillar proteins once the fish proteins were treated by acid or alkali. Solubility was apparently not a key factor for the texture properties of acid- or alkali-treated surimi.

Multiple crossings of the PF near 170 deg W, using a towed undulating instrument, provided high-​resolution, 'quasi-​synoptic' spatial profiles of the region. Increased chlorophyll levels were distributed in a band along the axis of the PF and extended southward. Cross-​correlation analysis between the physical and biological properties was used to estimate the average spatial separation between features during austral spring and summer. Oceanographic sections revealed a meandering front in early November. The separation between the strongest horizontal temperature and chlorophyll gradients displayed spatial offsets of <10 km in the anticylonic portion of the PF while weaker gradients displayed offsets of 20+ km in the cyclonic portion of the PF. Changes in geopotential anomaly and temperature were used to estimate the width of the PF. The width of the PF was small, averaging 50 km in the anti-cyclonic portion of the meander, and increased to 90 km in the cyclonic portion. Mixed layer depths were deep and averaged 200 m. In austral summer, spatial gradients were weaker across the entire survey region and separations between temperature and chlorophyll were variable. The width of the PF averaged 120 km during the austral summer. Mixed layer depths shoaled from the 200 m observed in November to 60 m in January. The results suggest that spatial separation between the physical and biological properties across the front is associated with PF width and meandering. Upwelling, as a consequence of secondary circulation and/or frontal meanders, induces cross-front circulation which promotes stratification of surface waters, creating favorable light conditions suitable for phytoplankton growth and enhanced levels of chlorophyll along the PF.","Howard, Cidney",ORESU-X-02-007,ORESU-X-02-007,E/INT-43,theses/disserta​tions,2002,Oregon Sea Grant,Spatial structure of the physical and biological distributions across the Antarctic Polar Front in austral spring and summer (thesis abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Albacore tuna were troll caught off the Oregon coast and transferred to the Oregon State University Seafood laboratory in Astoria, Oregon. Core samples were extracted from six designated body zones of 16 fish and analyzed for lipid, moisture, protein, ash, and fatty acid distribution. Proximate distribution was constant throughout the body zones. Protein and ash made up 25% of the composition, lipid and moisture made up the remaining 75%. The lipid content ranged from 3.9 +/- 0.2 to 36.3 +/- 1.1%, with a distribution of higher lipid towards the head and lower lipid towards the tail. Total omega-3 content averaged 40% of the identified fatty acids for each body zone, with omega-3 (g/lOOg tissue) ranging from 2.1 +/- 0.5 to 3.5 +/- 0.4. Furthermore, an inverse correlation (R^2= -0.95) was found for lipid and moisture content, enabling a faster estimate of lipid content derived from moisture content. Onboard handling techniques for West Coast albacore tuna were evaluated using sensory and analytical methods. Chilling (immediately and after 3 h), spiking, and bleeding at the throat and gills were evaluated by a sensory panel for overall quality, color, smell, texture and flavor. 2-​Thiobarbituric acid- reactive substances (TBARS) and pH were also compared. Rapid chilling significantly and positively influenced overall quality, color, texture, and flavor; and significantly reduced oxidative rancidity.

The first is the development of an oral DNA vaccine delivery system for fish. A novel oral DNA vaccine delivery system was developed for Rainbow Trout by combining non-viral vectors (polycationic liposomes or polycationic polymer) to facilitate the DNA vaccine's uptake by cell membranes along with enteric-coated protection of the DNA embedded in microparticles to prevent DNA degradation in the gastrointestina​l tract. Spray drying and spray coating bead techniques were employed in the preparation of the DNA vaccine microparticles. The spray drying technique allowed production of spherical shape enteric-coated microparticles with a particle size range of 0.18 to 20 um. Larger particle sizes of 40-50 mesh were obtained from the spray-coated bead technique. The resultant DNA vaccine microparticles were granulated with regular fish feed and given to fish to investigate the efficacy of the delivery system in providing protection against IHNV, and to demonstrate the ease of administration in fish. An in vivo fish trial experiment showed improvement in fish survival rate when fish were immunized with larger particle size DNA vaccine microparticles. Further research to find effective vector carriers for the DNA vaccine delivery system and to seek modifications of the delivery system that will still prevent the denaturation of plasmid DNA that will also facilitate membrane uptake of the DNA vaccine is needed in order to develop a safe, effective, and commercially viable vaccine to control the outbreak of IHNV. The second project of the dissertation is prediction of in vitro drug release profiles from a novel matrix tablet spray-coated with a barrier membrane using mathematical and statistical models. Tablets were prepared by direct compression followed by spray coating. The relationship of the amount of hydrophilic materials in the core tablets and barrier thickness on drug release mechanism was investigated using factorial design and regression analysis. Drug release characteristics were influenced and can be controlled by modifying the amount of hydrophilic materials in the core tablet and the barrier thickness. Mathematical equation generated from regression analysis of n-value, lag time, and percent drug release as a function of the amount of hydrophilic material and the amount of coating material applied can now be used as a tool for predicting and optimizing in vitro drug release from matrix tablets spray-coated with a barrier membrane.","Tantituvanont, Angkana",ORESU-X-03-002,ORESU-X-03-002,R/BT-30,theses/disserta​tions,2003,Oregon Sea Grant,"Novel formulation: development of oral microparticulat​e non-viral DNA vaccine delivery system against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) in rainbow trout, statistical design in matrix tablets formulation (dissertation abstract)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One of the most intriguing features is the sporadic interruption of normal marine pelagic sediment deposition by organic rich sediments deposited during oxygen-​deficient conditions (ocean anoxic events - OAEs). A current model for the abrupt onset and conclusion of these events relates increased trace metal delivery to the ocean during volcanic activity associated with ocean plateau construction, to the eventual depletion of oxygen and deposition of organic rich sediments. A majority of the trace metals are most likely released in eruption related ""event plumes"", degassed magmatic fluids mixed with seawater, rather than typical hydrothermal activity dominated by water/rock exchange. An important aspect of volcanic ""event plumes"" is that trace element concentrations are controlled by volatility into magmatic gases rather than solubility in water-rock reactions and therefore, the abundance pattern of released elements is fundamentally distinct from background hydrothermal venting. This study specifically evaluates a proposed link between ""event plumes"" associated with the construction of the Caribbean ocean plateau and OAE2 at the Cenomanian/Turo​nian (C/T) boundary (-93 Ma) by examining five globally distributed C/T boundary sedimentary sections for major, minor and trace elemental abundance patterns. Resulting trace metal anomalies are evaluated in terms of their timing and relationship to the other major biogeochemical perturbations at this time. After normalizing element concentrations to Zr to remove the effect of variable terrigenous input to these sediments, an interval of metal anomalies, at approximately the same stratigraphic location, is present in four of the five sites. I interpret the presence of metal abundance anomalies, and their stratigraphic position relative to events associated with OAE2, to suggest that hydrothermal activity could be the causative agent in pushing the ocean abruptly into anoxia. Also, the changes in trace metal patterns and intensities at all five sites are consistent with a source of metals being the Caribbean ocean plateau and modeled late-Cretaceous surface circulation.","Snow, Laura J.",ORESU-X-03-003,ORESU-X-03-003,E/INT-44,theses/disserta​tions,2003,Oregon Sea Grant,Hydrothermal links between ocean plateau formation and global anoxia at the Cenomanian-​Turonian Boundary (thesis abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Developing effective mitigation and preparedness plans requires a comprehensive understanding of community vulnerability. Research presented here focuses on the vulnerability of ports and harbors to earthquake and tsunami hazards and includes a regional study of stakeholder perceptions, a community-based process that integrates stakeholder and technical advisor expertise and a GIS-based approach that combines regional data with local stakeholder knowledge. The perception study was conducted to gauge hazard and vulnerability awareness, current state of readiness and priorities for future work. To date, communities have developed mitigation and response strategies, with less energy devoted to post-event recovery plans. Although city and county hazard strategies have been developed, little has been done to make individual offices or businesses less vulnerable. To further vulnerability reduction efforts, respondents rated public outreach programs, cost/benefit analyses and hazard mapping efforts as high priority. The second study of port and harbor vulnerability focuses on an assessment approach based on the integration of technical advisor and stakeholder expertise in a collaborative workshop setting. Through this process, participants were most concerned with potential life loss and other nonstructural vulnerability issues rather than structural issues, such as damage to specific buildings. The inclusion of stakeholder input and assessments from both geographic and community function viewpoints provided a more robust representation of community vulnerability issues than only site-specific technical analyses. The third study of port and harbor vulnerability focuses on the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, with an emphasis on identifying community resources that protect life safety, the built environment and infrastructure integrity, and economic vitality. Products from this GIS approach, such as composite vulnerability maps, can serve as a basis for setting community priorities for increasing resiliency to natural hazards. Results from this GIS approach suggest that widely available on-line data sources must be supplemented with local knowledge if realistic preparedness and mitigation strategies are to be developed.

Increasing salt concentration up to 1% increased fracture shear stress and strain values, but further increase affected negatively. A strong relationship was found between the G' and fracture stress values as affected by moisture or pH, but not by salt concentration. Linear regression analyses indicated that while moisture concentration and pH can be used as an index estimating final gel quality, salt concentration cannot be used. Thermal stability, proteolytic enzyme degradation, and thermal aggregation patterns of myofibrillar proteins from various fish species were also compared.

Electromagnetic analysis approaches can provide accurate parameter calculation and performance prediction for these new products / prototypes of energy system devices. They are powerful and efficient tools for new product development and existing product optimization. The research analysis work of this thesis applied the LTA (Layer Theory Approach) and FEM (Finite Element Method) to analyze two types of new energy system devices, a permanent magnet coupling and its derivatives and the prototype of a linear reluctance machine, respectively. LTA is a suitable and efficient tool for devices like linear induction machines and permanent magnet couplings, which include sheet conductors as secondaries. FEM is an analysis tool with wider application area. It is applicable for most devices even with complicated structures. But, it has numerous disadvantages including large memory requirements and very long computational times. The performance of a permanent magnet dynamometer-​brake coupling was predicted with the LTA program and compared with experimental results. The comparison shows good correlation between the layer model and the test data. The LTA program was also proved to be a useful tool for parametric design studies and conceptual designs for devices such as large quiet brakes to be used in the testing of drives for Navy ships. 2-D FEM with calibration techniques were adopted to analyze the complicated prototype of a linear reluctance machine.

High IS (600 mM NaCl) resulted in protein aggregation at low pH but improved myosin heavy chain (MHC) solubility at pH 6 -10. Changes in total sulfhy-dryl (SH) content and surface hydrophobicity (So were associated with the different molecular weight distributions of the soluble proteins. At pH 4 and IS 10-100 mM, MHC was soluble but degraded. At pH 10, the formation of high MW polymers was observed at IS>150 mM. Gels obtained from FPI prepared at pHl I/IS 150 and conventional surimi (CS) were superior to FPI prepared at pH 3 and/or other IS levels. There was no correlation between protein solubility and gel properties of FPI. Gelation mechanisms of acid- and alkali- treated FPI were identical under the same IS condition. FPI prepared at pH 3 or 11 could be partly refolded at pH 7. No significant difference in texture was observed between alkali-treated protein isolates (AKPI, pH 11) kept frozen at pH 5.5 and 7.0. Strongest gel was found for AKPI with cryoprotectants (C) and without freeze/thaw (FT) cycles at both pH storage (5C & 7C), while poor gel was obtained from AKPI without cryoprotectants (NC) and with FT (5NC-F & 7NC-F). 5NC-F & 7NC-F demonstrated the lowest So and total SH probably suggesting that proteins were more aggregated as a result of hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed the most discontinuity of gels from AKPI without cryoprotectants and with FT and showed less protein stability when stored at pH 5.5 than at neutral pH. Raman spectral analysis demonstrated that refolding of AKPI by pH adjustment to 7.0 was achieved, but not identical to the native protein. CS contained higher cc-helix content (approx. 50%) than AKPI (approx. 20-30%). Frozen storage induced a decrease and an increase in the alpha- helix of CS and AKPI samples, respectively. Alkali-treated proteins were slightly less stable than CS during frozen storage.","Thawornchinsomb​ut, S.",ORESU-X-04-001,ORESU-X-04-001,R/SF-32-PD,theses/disserta​tions,2004,Oregon Sea Grant,Biochemical and gelation properties of fish protein isolate prepared under various pH and ionic strength conditions (dissertation abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such a solution is likely to affect virtually everyone in the Pacific Northwest. Ensuring public understanding of and support for species restoration policies is especially important, because many of such policies involve making difficult trade-offs. This issue is especially relevant to the situation in Oregon where citizens are directly involved in environmental policy-making, thus, public support for salmon restoration options is a vital component of the policy process. This study was designed to identify the major factors influencing public support for salmon restoration policies, including policy-relevant knowledge, risk perception, ideological and attitudinal factors, as well as a sense of political efficacy and social trust. Key findings indicate that ideological and attitudinal factors are the most important predictors of public support for salmon restoration alternatives, such as removal of hydroelectric dams, limiting certain agricultural and forestry practices, elimination of hatcheries, and urban stream protection measures. Ideological and attitudinal variables have both direct and indirect impacts on policy support. In addition, higher levels of social trust and a sense of political efficacy also led to stronger support for salmon restoration policies. The results presented in this study suggest the need for a more holistic approach to understanding the sources and assessing the limits of public support for salmon restoration options. In general, both outreach and research activities should concentrate on overcoming the negative impacts of ideological and attitudinal cleavages and reconciling seemingly insurmountable differences in opinions on salmon policy. Providing additional knowledge should be tailored to the needs of the various constituencies and should be sensitive to a wide range of ideological stances and attitudinal positions.","Fomenko, V.",ORESU-X-04-002,ORESU-X-04-002,R/SD-08,theses/disserta​tions,2004,Oregon Sea Grant,Public support for species conservation policies: major determinants in the case of the Pacific salmon controversy (dissertation abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These studies assessed the effects of nineteen putative elicitor compounds on the growth and metabolite production of five species of marine cyanobacteria, biosynthetic investigation of an intriguing secondary metabolite, phormidolide, and the discovery of one novel halogenated peptide, phormidamide. The growth, biomass production and the ratio of the components of the extract were affected by some of the elicitors in most of the cyanobacterial species tested. However, production of a novel second- ary metabolite or a significant change in the bioactivity of the extracts was not observed. Biosynthetic investigations of a brominated brine shrimp toxic polyketide, phormidolide, were conducted on a cultured Phormidium sp. strain originally isolated from Indonesia. Stable isotope feeding experiments confirmed its polyketide nature and established a new example of a general trend in cyanobacterial metabolism where both S-adenosyl methionine and C2 of acetate contribute to the biogenesis of pendant methyl groups. At the same time, feedings with deuterated acetate provided insight into the HMG-CoA synthase-like mechanism by which addition of pendant methyl groups from C2 of acetate takes place. Studies of phormidolide production in bromine-​depleted medium showed that two analogs are produced, debromophormido​lide with a terminal olefin in place of the vinyl bromide, and iodophormidolid​e, introducing iodine in place of bromine from the trace amounts present in the medium. Supplementation of the bromine-​depleted culture medium with iodine resulted in a 10-fold increase of iodophormidolid​e production, while bromine supplementation resulted in a more moderate (2.5 fold) enhancement in phormidolide yield. A novel halogenated cytotoxic peptide, phormidamide, was isolated and a planar structure is proposed, pending confirmation by X-ray crystallographi​c analysis. Phormidamide contains a unique bromophenylalan​ine functionality, three chlorine atoms, and a very high number of quaternary carbon atoms which have hindered structural elucidation efforts through spectroscopic methods.","Vulpanovici, F.

Knowing specifically where and how intensively trawl effort has occurred over time provides ecologists with the necessary background for habitat impact and recovery studies, and provides fishery managers with an assessment of how habitat conser- vation objectives are being met. The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the extent to which the 2000 Pacific Fishery Management Council footrope restriction has shifted and reduced trawl fishing effort on Oregon fishing grounds, (2) to relate these changes in distribution to the benthic habitat type over which they occur, and (3) to develop methods for enhancing fine-scale spatial review of targeted fishing effort. Density analysis of available trawl start locations provided a spatial and temporal understanding of how fishing efforts increased and decreased in relation to habitat distribution and fishery management actions between 1995 and 2002. Trawl effort patterns exhibit significant inter-annual variability and patchy distribution. Areas of increased fishing effort were still evident between years, despite an overall decline in trawl tows across the time scale of this study. Tow end point locations for the years 1998-2001 were retrieved from manual logbooks for five reference sites located in the proximity of rock habitat features. Trawl towlines were mapped from start to end point and demonstrated a marked enhancement of fine-scale fishing effort resolution, with increased ability to identify effort shifts over benthic habitat. Distinct spatial shifts in fishing intensity (measured as km towed) away from rock habitat were evident at all reference sites, with an average reduction of 86%. Some slight shifts into surrounding unconsolidated sediments also occurred, indicating effort displacement as well as reduction. Fishing intensity was calculated from commercial trawl and research trawl survey towlines to achieve the most accurate assessment of fishing impacts and potential habitat recovery areas. Research trawling intensity was less than 1% of commercial trawl effort originating from the same sites. A brief comparison of Oregon vessel towlines and California vessel towlines demonstrated similar targeted fishing patterns by both fleets, except at one site. Results indicate that the footrope restriction, in conjunction with associated landing limits, was effective in protecting rocky habitats from trawl fishing impacts. Reference areas were identified where essential fish habitat (EFH) recovery is likely occurring off the coast of Oregon. Substantial regulatory changes continue in this fishery, with trip limits and gear restrictions continuously adjusted. Continued monitory and review of spatial trawl data would assist in fishery management decision-making and assess conservation objectives for depleted groundfish and associated habitats. Future research should incorporate analysis of catch data and expand the review of trawl towlines for the entire U.S. west coast groundfish fishery. The trawl towline spatial analysis developed in this work is a credible method for reviewing fishing effort at the scale of the fishery and in relation to detailed habitat data. The research presented here provides an example of how an interdisciplina​ry approach and critical assessment of data can work to resolve marine management challenges.","Bellman, M.

Once landed, the majority of Oregon seafood spends little time on the coast, and a large portion of that seafood is stored in facilities along the 1-5 corridor from Eugene to Bellingham. Many of these facilities are designed to hold agri- cultural and livestock products that do not have the same storage temperature requirements as seafood. Interest in coastal cold storage development has ranged from a relatively small walk-in cold store designed for a fishermen's cooperative; a relatively small cold storage warehouse serving a value-added processor; and a relatively large cold storage warehouse designed for a diverse set of products that may be managed by a port authority. This range of interest makes a single feasibility study inappropriate for the majority of interested parties. By using readily available software and collecting necessary cost data, a regionally-​based economic simulation model was developed to help interested parties explore the economic feasibility of various cold storage development scenarios. Further efforts integrated the model with research on frozen Pacific whiting surimi to provide a framework for designing cold stores for optimal temperatures. This model serves as an exploratory tool to support rural coastal communities in their economic development efforts by providing community leaders with analytical power and a cost-effective alternative to hiring outside analysts.","Burden, M.

When located in the nearshore region the modified wave climate can also substantially change the location of breaking and has been observed to impact the shoreline morphology. The current study focuses on the borrow pit case and attempts to explain how limitations in existing methodologies may impact the predictions in both the wave field modification and shoreline response. Recent analytical methods by Bender (2003) have successfully explained the wave transformation near pits. However, these models are only capable of modeling bathymetries of constant depth surrounding the anomaly. Therefore in order to investigate cases without this restriction, this often requires numerical solutions following Berkhoffs (1972) mild-slope equation (MSE). However, a significant limitation of these model types is the accuracy suffers for steep bathymetric features. Booij (1983) demonstrates this for slopes larger than 1:3 (rise:run). Furthermore, these models often rely on Radder's (1979) parabolic approximation to the MSE which restricts the ability to include wave reflection which can be substantial in the case of a borrow pit. These limitations and their effects on shoreline response are investigated in the current study. By utilizing a form of the modified mild-slope equation (MMSE) originally derived by Massel (1993) the limitation of the MSE in representing steep features is removed. Additionally, a numerical model following Lee et al. (1998) is employed to investigate wave transformation around borrow pits of arbitrary depth. The formulation of the model is of hyperbolic form; therefore, the reflected waves generated by a borrow pit are included. The models accuracy is validated through a rigorous set of tests showing that the model compares well with previous analytical solutions for steep features.","Michalsen, D.

It is estimated that if 0.2% of the ocean's untapped energy could be harnessed, it could provide power sufficient for the entire world. Ocean energy extraction is an old concept, and it is currently seeing the benefit of advancing support technologies and an increasing awareness of potential future energy deficits. Girard, in Paris, registered the world's first wave energy device patent in 1799. Over more than 200 years of development, the number of patents has greatly increased and today there are currently more than 1500 ocean wave energy device patents.

The primary focus will be on two particular generator types, a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) and a Wound Rotor Induction Generator (WRIG), and their reactions to a simulated wave profile.

Managers must account for the mortality of discarded fish to assess fish populations, yet discard mortality rates of specific fisheries are generally unknown. Delayed mortality is one source of undetected mortality in discarded fish. The observance of delayed mortality in discards during laboratory and field studies suggest that capture stressors may induce physiological modifications that result indirectly in future mortality from stress and/or disease. Since the imposition of a stressor disrupts the capability of a fish to maintain immunological function, understanding the capacity of the immune system to function after an acute bycatch stressor may be important in assessing the survival of discarded fish and further understanding the mechanisms behind delayed mortality. Our main objective was to describe the immunological health of sablefish exposed to capture stressors. First, we reported a number of experiments that evaluated the conditions necessary to maximize a [3H]-thymidine lymphocyte incorporated assay sensitive to B and T cell mitogens. Then, in laboratory experiments designed to simulate the capture process, we subjected sablefish to various stressors that may influence survival: towing in a net, hooking, ecologically relevant temperature of seawater and air, and air exposure time. Following the imposition of stress, the immunological assay was used to assess immune function. The results demonstrated that the proliferative response of leukocytes from stressed sablefish regardless of fishing gear type, exposure to elevated seawater temperatures or air times had significantly diminished responses to the T cell mitogen concanavalin A or the B cell mitogen lipopolysacchar​ide. A significant difference in the immunological response associated with seawater or air temperature was not detected. The duration and severity of the capture stressors applied in our study were harsh enough to induce significantly elevated levels of cortisol and glucose. However, there was no difference in the magnitude of plasma cortisol and glucose among stress treatments. These data suggest that immunological suppression occurs in sablefish subjected to capture-related stressors. The proposal that the immune system is functionally impaired after exposure to capture- related stress presents a potential reason why delayed mortality is possible in discarded sablefish. As a fish is discarded back into the ocean, their ability to perform at the whole organism level may be diminished for an extended period of time and the cumulative strain from maintaining this physiological adaptation can reduce its ability to sustain normal immunological functions. Consequently, this immunological impairment can possibly predispose a discarded fish to disease and eventual death. However, further studies are needed to determine if delayed mortality in sablefish discards can be caused by increased susceptibility to infectious agents resulting from stress-mediated immunosuppressi​on.","Lupes, S.",ORESU-X-04-009,ORESU-X-04-009,R/RFC-06;R/RFC-06-PD;R/RFC-11,theses/disserta​tions,2004,Oregon Sea Grant,"Capture-related stressors impair sablefish, ""Anoplopoma fimbria,"" immune system function (thesis abstract)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The major constituents of the film are iron and silica in a 3:1 ratio based on Scanning Electron Microscopy - Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS).

A third line at 4.5 A is also present in some areas. Halite and quartz are also found in association with the film.

Restoration with large woody debris increased the condition of juvenile coho prior to carcass additions, but results varied among streams. Salmon derived nutrient incorporation was determined by measuring a15N and a13C of juvenile coho salmon and aquatic macroinvertebra​tes. Results did not show strong evidence of salmon derived nutrient incorporation at any level of the food web. We also used the methods of Bilby et al.

Results indicated that incorporation of salmon derived nutrients increase as natural spawned salmon densities increased. Additionally we saw greater incorporation of salmon derived nutrients from natural spawners than from placed carcasses indicating a difference in their effects on ecosystem function.

A minimum specimen size of a 2-cm (100-150 ug) segment of a strand was established. This indicates that small hair fragments found in archeological excavations can be informative. It also allowed the testing of up to 12 sequential segments from strands up to 24 cm long. Since hair grows about 1 cm per month, a 24-cm strand provided about a 2-yr record of isotopes and diet. The isotopic variations along some strands were as high as 0.49% for delta 15N and 1,05% for delta 13C, exceeding the background analytical uncertainty of O.22% for delta 15N and 0.21% for delta 13C. Differences between individuals and between population groups also exceeded this background level, validating the use of this isotope technique in discriminating isotopic differences between hairs and between people. No isotopic differences were found between males and females, and no isotopic differences were found based on the age of the individual. This suggests that there are no physiological differences by gender or age affecting isotope metabolism, which means that should a study find an isotopic difference between men and women, it would reflect dietary differences, not physiological ones. Isotope testing produced distinct isotope profiles (delta 15N vs. delta 13C) for two cultural groups, the Lower Brule reservation Sioux of 1892 and the reservation Blackfoot of 1892 and 1935. The resultant dietary profiles indicate a higher consumption of meat by the Blackfoot and a higher consumption of corn by the Lower Brule. The two groups of Blackfoot fit into the same profile despite the passage of several decades. This raises the possibility that stable isotope analysis can also be used to identify members of the same cultural population.","Roy, Diana Milantia",ORESU-X-02-006,ORESU-X-02-006,R/CC-04,theses/disserta​tions,2002,Oregon Sea Grant,Using stable-isotope analysis to obtain dietary profiles from hair (thesis abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent catch data indicate a trend of age-truncation in the black rockfish population off the Oregon coast, with older females rapidly disappearing from the population. In populations with broad age distributions, older fish may contribute disproportionat​ely to larval production through a variety of mechanisms. Thus, the removal of older age classes through fishing may impact the population far beyond the simple loss of biomass. We tested the hypothesis that older females produce higher quality offspring, or offspring otherwise more capable of survival, than those from younger females. Mature female black rockfish of various ages were captured live and held until parturition. Larvae were then reared under identical conditions to compare performance in terms of growth, starvation, and mortality. Results indicate that older females produce offspring that grow faster in both length and weight, survive longer in the absence of an exogenous food supply, and exhibit lower mortality rates than offspring from younger mothers. This difference in larval performance may be explained by the relatively greater amount of endogenous energy reserves present in the oil globules of offspring from older mothers. Larval oil globule volume at parturition was significantly related to all larval performance factors and was strongly correlated with maternal age. Given the difference in larval quality, it is critical for the management of black rockfish, and possibly other species as well, that these older individuals not be addressed solely in terms of biomass, but their relative reproductive contribution and the repercussions of their removal from the population be considered.","Chapman, Colin G.",ORESU-X-03-010,ORESU-X-03-010,R/HAB-01;R/RCF-01,theses/disserta​tions,2003,Oregon Sea Grant,"Recruitment variability in black rockfish (""Sebastes melanops""): effects of maternal age on offspring quality (thesis abstract)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Predictions of the survival of discarded fish are dependent on understanding how a fish responds to stressful conditions. Our objective was to describe the immunological health of sablefish exposed to capture stressors. In laboratory experiments designed to simulate the capture process, we subjected sablefish to various stressors that might influence survival: towing in a net, hooking, elevated seawater and air temperatures, and air exposure time. After stress was imposed, the in vitro mitogen-​stimulated proliferation of sablefish leukocytes was used to evaluate the function of the immune system in an assay we validated for this species. The results demonstrated that regardless of fishing gear type, exposure to elevated seawater temperature, or time in air, the leukocytes from stressed sablefish exhibited significantly diminished proliferative responses to the T-cell mitogen, concanavalin A, or the B- cell mitogen, lipopolysacchar​ide. There was no difference in the immunological responses associated with seawater or air temperature. The duration and severity of the capture stressors applied in our study were harsh enough to induce significantly elevated levels of plasma cortisol and glucose, but there was no difference in the magnitude of levels among stressor treatments. These data suggest that immunological suppression occurs in sablefish subjected to capture-related stressors. The functional impairment of the immune system after capture presents a potential reason why delayed mortality is possible in discarded sablefish. Further studies are needed to determine whether delayed mortality in discarded sablefish can be caused by increased susceptibility to infectious agents resulting from stressor- mediated immunosuppressi​on.","Lupes, Sarah C.;Davis, Michael W.;Olla, Bori L.;Schreck, Carl B.",ORESU-R-06-002,ORESU-R-06-002,R/RCF-11,reprints (peer-reviewed),2006,Oregon Sea Grant,Capture-related stressors impair immune system function in sablefish,NA,NA,"""Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,"" 135:129-138, 2006.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Two benthic microbial fuel cells were deployed at a deep-ocean cold seep within Monterey Canyon, California, and were monitored for 125 days. Their anodes consisted of single graphite rods that were placed within microbial mat patches of the seep, while the cathodes consisted of carbon-​fibre/titanium wire brushes attached to graphite plates suspended -0.5 m above the sediment. Power records demonstrated a maximal sustained power density of 34 mW m^-2 of anode surface area, equating to 1100 mW m^-2 of seafloor. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of microbial biofilms that formed on the electrode surfaces revealed changes in microbial community composition along the anode as a function of sediment depth and surrounding geochemistry. Near the sediment surface (20-29 cm depth), the anodic biofilm was dominated by micro- organisms closely related to Desulfuromonas acetoxidans. At horizons 46-55 and 70-76 cm below the sediment-water interface, clone libraries showed more diverse populations, with increasing representation of 5- proteobacteria such as Desulfocapsa and Syntrophus, as well as e-​proteobacteria. Genes from phylotypes related to Pseudomonas dominated the cathode clone library. These results confound ascribing a single electron transport role performed by only a few members of the microbial community to explain energy harvesting from marine sediments. In addition, the microbial fuel cells exhibited slowly decreasing current attributable to a combination of anode passivation and sulfide mass transport limitation. Electron micrographs of fuel cell anodes and laboratory experiments confirmed that sulfide oxidation products can build up on anode surfaces and impede electron transfer. Thus, while cold seeps have the potential to provide more power than neighboring ocean sediments, the limits of mass transport as well as the proclivity for passivation must be considered when developing new benthic microbial fuel cell designs to meet specific power requirements.","Reimers, C.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/6033271_3191_2816205.csv,24,"Microbial source tracking is necessary because standard methods of measuring fecal contamination in water by enumerating fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) do not identify the source or sources of the contamination. Source tracking methods can be divided according to whether or not they require a library (a ""host origin database"" or set of bacterial isolates from fecal samples of known origin). Methods can also be divided by whether or not they use FIB and by whether or not they require cultivation of microbes. These variables all affect the cost, time required, and effectiveness of the methods. Prominent library-​dependent methods include antibiotic resistance analysis (phenotypic) and fingerprinting analyses (genotypic) such as ribotyping, REP-PCR and PFGE. Library-depend methods are costly, time consuming, and have complex and sometimes poorly understood requirements for sample sizes and analyses. In addition, new libraries are needed for each geographical region. Prominent non-​library-​dependent methods include chemical markers (e.g. fecal sterols/stanols​, caffeine and laundry whiteners) and host-specific PCR (e.g. of Bacteroidales molecular markers). Another set of techniques involves direct molecular monitoring of human viruses such as adenoviruses and enteroviruses. Viruses are important because they are not well correlated with FIB but are important pathogens. All of these methods have been tested at the proof-​of-​concept level, but there have been few organized comparisons and proficiency tests with blind samples. In one such study, the SCCWRP study, host-specific PCR performed well, as did ribotyping and PFGE. Other comparative studies have found somewhat different results. All support the following conclusions: 1) No method is quantitative; 2) Results from the same method differ depending on the operator and on differences in experimental design and analysis. Few studies have followed up the results of fecal source tracking to quantify resulting gains in water quality. The best evidence supports taking a multi-tiered approach to source tracking, moving from general to specific and from less to more expensive. The first step is intensive surveys using FIB, to target sources spatially and temporally. Once ""hot spots"" are identified, then very directed source tracking can be done if needed, starting with less-expensive methods that identify human contamination, and continuing to more-expensive ones as needed, to identify common species, or finally to identify all species. Companies that offer source-tracking services should be provided with blind proficiency samples to assess their abilities and estimate possible benefits, before they are hired. Water quality standards were established based on epidemiological studies that measured human health outcomes following recreational exposure to human-derived fecal contamination. There are no similar studies for exposure to animal fecal contamination, although it is logical to assume that the risk from animal fecal contamination is lower. Thus even if microbial source tracking shows that fecal contamination is animal-derived, there is usually no way to allow for a higher permitted level of FIB. Hence the benefits from microbial source tracking at the present time are only that it allows the source or sources of fecal contamination to be accurately assigned, located, and corrected. In some cases this could lead to a reduction in FIB. In other cases where the source is primarily wildlife and there is no way to control the wildlife, no immediate water quality benefit from microbial source tracking will be seen. National environmental health agencies must take the responsibility to fund the required epidemiological studies so microbial source tracking can be properly applied to estimate human health risk.","Field, K.

Increased salt concentration from 2% to 3% also decreased surimi density. The ability of surimi to float or sink in water was observed according to changes in density.

When surimi was thawed for 4 h before chopping at 20 deg C with 3% salt, the lowest breaking force and deformation values were found. Apparent viscosity of surimi decreased as moisture content increased from 80% to 84%, salt concentration increased from 2% to 3%, and chopping temperature decreased from 20 deg C to 5 deg C.

Mapping of the dune sheet (150 ground-truthing sites) shows that the dune deposits mantle more than 90% of the coastal plain. Detailed soil profiles (1-30 m depth) show that the paleodune deposits consist of interbedded dune sand, paleosols (Bg or Bw accumulation horizons), deflation surfaces, and iron-oxide (Ortstein) layers. Two dominant paleosol facies types consist of 1) flat lying, semi-continuous, Bg-accumulation horizons associated with groundwater level deflation surfaces, and 2) curvilinear, discontinuous Bw accumulation horizons associated with stabilized upland dune forms. Investigation of the cement mineralogy using XRD and SEM analytical methods show that the deposits are composed of weakly cemented minerals (vermiculite, gibbsite, allophane, imogolite, and ferrihydrite) resulting from sediment mineral weathering products, loess infiltration, and groundwater precipitation within the paleodune strata. The field and laboratory methods used in this study to characterize the geotechnical and hydrological properties included ground penetrating radar (GPR), pressuremeter, direct shear testing, flexible wall permeability, and triaxial compression testing. The dune facies consisted of clean (<5% fines), fine uniform sand with an average hydraulic conductivity of 1.49xl0^3 cm/s. The paleosol facies consisted of silty (>40% fines) fine sand to sandy silt with a hydraulic conductivity ranging from 6.21xlO4 cm/s to 1.63xl0^6 cm/s. Results from soil strength tests showed that the calculated cohesion values taken from direct shear, triaxial, and PMT testing ranged from 0 to 64.2 kPa and the angle of internal friction taken from direct shear and triaxial testing ranged from 18 to 43 degrees. The measured shear strengths of the paleodune strata are lower than values expected to support observed semi-stable slopes of 50 deg ?70 deg. Laboratory testing underestimated temporary cemented sand shear strength, however, the measured internal angles of friction should provide conservative values for long-term slope stability analysis.

The uppermost unit is a deflated surface containing burnt shell and lithic artifacts associated with early Holocene 14C dates, while the underlying unit contained only lithic tools and debitage, some of which were associated with a 14C date of 10,430 +/- 150 RCYBP. The late Pleistocene lithic assemblage at 35-CU-67C provides the earliest evidence for human presence on the Oregon coast to date. Analysis performed on the late Pleistocene assemblage addresses the validity of existing hypotheses regarding the nature of early Oregon coastal hunter- gatherer technological and subsistence strategies. These hypotheses are focused on whether early populations on the Oregon coast practiced a generalist-​forager or collector subsistence strategy. Using theoretical approaches that deal with the organization of hunter-gatherer technology, analyses were conducted on the lithic tool and debitage assemblages at 35-CU-67C in order to infer past hunter- gatherer behavior. Through the implementation of multiple tool and debitage analysis methodologies, issues of hunter-gatherer mobility, raw material procurement, stages of lithic reduction, tool production, and site function are presented. The data generated by the late Pleistocene lithic assemblage at 35-CU-67C are compared with the overlying surficial assemblage, additional early sites along the North American Pacific coast, and to contemporaneous sites located further inland within the Pacific Northwest region. Results of the lithic analyses at 35-CU-67C show distinct similarities in debitage trends between the assemblages of each stratigraphic unit. However, when tool assemblages from these units are compared, discrepancies in the types and amount of tools are found. Reasons for intra-site variability and similarity are explained through raw material studies and site function at 35-CU-67C. Additionally, similarities between the early tool assemblage at 35-CU-67C and those found in early tool assemblages on the extended Pacific coast and interior Pacific Northwest regions are discussed. This thesis demonstrates that early southern Oregon coastal populations had a tendency towards high mobility and used a generalized toolkit organization. Early lithic technology used at 35-CU-67C emphasized multidirectiona​l core technology and biface manufacture in the form of performs and leaf-shaped projectile-​points. This type of technological organization is to be expected from hunter- gatherers practicing a generalist-​forager subsistence strategy. Based on the 10,430 +/- 150 RCYBP date and technological organization at 35-CU-67C, early Oregon coastal occupation is seen as encompassing a generalist- forager subsistence strategy most likely adapted to both coastal and terrestrial environments.","Willis, S.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/6033416_3176_2816190.csv,1,"Ceratomyxa shasta is a myxozoan parasite of salmonids and requires the freshwater polychaete, Manayunkia speciosa to complete its life cycle. The parasite's distribution is currently limited to the Pacific Northwest region of North America and has been reported to cause substantial losses of both wild and hatchery salmonids. The spatial and seasonal distribution of C. shasta can vary considerably both within and between river systems. This variation was thought to be a result of specific habitat requirements limiting polychaete distribution and abundance. Field studies were conducted in the Klamath River basin where C. shasta is suspected to have caused high losses in migrating juvenile salmonids. The purpose of this study was to document the host-parasite distribution of C. shasta in the river, assess its ability to cause disease, and study aspects of the polychaetes habitat ecology. This is the first study to report the broad-scale distribution of M. speciosa in a river and the various characteristics of those populations. The seasonal distribution of C. shasta in the Klamath River was investigated by exposing separate groups of C shasta-​susceptible rainbow trout {Oncorhynchus mykiss) at monthly intervals during the study. The spatial distribution was assessed by one basin-wide exposure. The ability of C. shasta to cause disease in native Klamath River salmonids was investigated by exposing fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshaw-ytscha; Iron Gate Hatchery strain), along with the known susceptible strains of rainbow trout. The distribution and habitat preferences of M speciosa were investigated by collecting benthic habitat samples from a variety of habitat types. Where populations were identified, sampling was conducted at a finer scale to study aspects of those populations such as size, density, and age-structure. The distribution and prevalence of C. shasta infection in populations of M speciosa were determined by using a pooled prevalence strategy on several polychaete populations throughout the Klamath River. Ceratomyxa shasta, with few exceptions, was only detected in exposure groups from the main-stem Klamath. The parasite could be detected from April until November when water temperatures reached 6�C. It is likely the parasite could be detected beyond the temporal limits of this study. Prevalence of infection was high with little mortality in rainbow trout exposures groups above Iron Gate dam (Upper Klamath River). Mortality was 100% for rainbow trout exposure groups below Iron Gate Dam (Lower Klamath River). Fall Chinook salmon demonstrated a high level of resistance to the parasite above Iron Gate Dam compared to the rainbow trout, but suffered nearly 50% mortality below the dam. This suggests that resistance of native stocks to the parasite can be overwhelmed in the Lower Klamath River and provides further evidence that infectious dose is high relative to the Upper Klamath River. The polychaete host, M. speciosa, was found to occur throughout the Klamath River and was often located in slow flowing depositional habitats such as pools and reservoirs. River populations were highly aggregated into small areas whereas reservoir populations were large, widespread and centered at the inflow area. Sand-organic matter substrates and mat-forming epilithic algae were primary microhabitats. Flow velocity, habitat stability and life traits such as dispersal ability appear to be primary factors limiting distribution and abundance of the polychaete. Populations of M. speciosa tested for the prevalence of C. shasta infection demonstrate a low mean prevalence of 0.27% with areas of elevated infection (4.8 and 8.3%) located just downstream of Iron Gate Dam. This suggests that this area may be the primary source of infectious actinospores contributing to the high juvenile salmonid mortality observed in the Lower Klamath River.","Stocking, R.

For a Lyngbya cf. aestuarii dominated mat from Baja California Sui"", Mexico, periods of hydra-tion occur about every two weeks and last for only a few days. Upon rehydration of the Lyngbya mat, respiratory activity recovered in about 10-30 minutes followed by the full recovery of photosynthetic activity in about 2-3 hours. The rapid recovery of photosynthesis in these mats suggests that they are able to take full advantage of each period of hydration. However, salinities outside the natural range for the local environment (i.e. 35?50 ppt) were detrimental to recovery by not only slowing recovery but limiting maximum photosynthetic activity, as well. Photosynthetic activity recovered more rapidly under higher light intensities, but excessive light became inhibitory later when photosynthesis had recovered almost fully. Based on chlorophyll fluorescence analysis, sequential changes in photochemistry were measured during rehydration of the Lyngbya mat. Photosynthetic recovery was primarily limited by the recovery of functional PSII complexes. The slower recovery of photosynthesis in mat stressed by high salt was probably due to direct inhibition of PSII centers as well as the disruption of energy transfer from phycobilisomes to the PSII centers. Functional PSII centers were closed initially, probably due to the reduction of the electron transport chain by respiratory activity. The time that PSII centers remained closed early in recovery increased with light above approx. 50 W m-2. This closure can lead to the generation of destructive singlet oxygen. Many desiccation-​tolerant cyanobacteria produce an ultraviolet radiation (UVR) screening compound, scytonemin, that is located in the extracellular polysaccharide sheath. Scytonemin is an extremely stable molecule that can provide protection from UVR even when cells are desiccated and metabolically inactive. In two out of three strains of cyanobacteria exposed to UVA, scytonemin content increased in response to periodic desiccation stress. In addition, the desiccation-​tolerant cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 produced scytonemin only when allocating large amounts of ATP to fixing N2. These experiments support the theory that cyanobacteria increase scytonemin content when metabolically stressed.","Fleming, E.

Factors affecting ingestion rate of prey items by fish larvae include environmental factors such as light intensity, prey/background contrast, possible chemical cues, and co-feeding with live foods. The efficient addition of FAA (free amino acids) into microp articles, at concentrations similar to those found in live foods may reduce or eliminate the need for exogenous proteases and FAA from live feeds. Complex particles (CP), when coupled with optimization of environmental parameters, may result in ingestion of artificial diets at rates sufficient to support high survival and growth rates. Lipid spray beads (LSB) have shown promise in their ability to deliver low molecular weight water-soluble (LMWS) nutrients to marine fish larvae. Furthermore, ingestion and digestion of zein-bound (CP) with incorporated LSB by fish larvae have been reported. Here we describe improvements to LSB technology as well as feeding conditions for the effective delivery of FAA to blue spotted goby larvae (Asterropteryx semipunctatd). The FAA glycine was used as a model LMWS nutrient due to its high solubility in water. LSB performance was found to be optimized with an aqueous core concentration of 400 g l^-1 glycine and were shown to have significantly higher DE over a 60 min period in aqueous suspension compared to that of beads with lower core glycine concentrations (two-way ANOVA; p<0.0001). Evaluation of core to lipid ratios (v/v) showed that retention and delivery efficiencies of LSB containing cores of 400 g glycine l^-1 at a core to lipid ratio of 1:2 v/v were greater than those of LSB with other core to lipid ratios. The use of optimized LSB in zein- bound CP resulted in an encapsulation efficiency of 4% w/w glycine for the CP, which was within the range of FAA concentrations of rotifers, Artemia and copepods.","Clack, B.",ORESU-X-06-003,ORESU-X-06-003,R/SAQ-07,theses/disserta​tions,2006,Oregon Sea Grant,"Development of methods to improve acceptability of artificial diets by ""Asteropteryx semipunctata"" (blue spotted goby) (thesis abstract)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The lipid content in sardines was initially low (6.79%) in the beginning of the season, increased to 22.95% in mid-August, and decreased slightly by the end of September. An inverse correlation (R^2=0.90) was found between lipid and moisture content. Analysis showed that 20:5n3 was the most abundant fatty acid in sardine oil followed by 16:0 and 22:6n3. Microbial lipases from Candida rugosa (CR), Candida cylindracea (CC), Mucor javanicus (MJ), and Aspergillus niger (AN) were used for enzymatic hydrolyses of sardine oil to concentrate n-3 polyun- saturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs). Hydrolysis with CR and CC lipases resulted in a two-fold increase of docosahexaenoic acid while MJ and AN were less effective in concentrating n-3 PUFAs. Thin layer chromatography analysis showed that triglycerides were the predominant fraction in the final products. A new oil extraction method involving isoelectric point (pi) adjustment was compared with the heat processing method in terms of lipid recovery and quality. Oil extracted by adjusting pH to pi using tartaric acid and citric acid showed the highest oil recovery, followed by calcium tartarate (Ca-TA) and calcium citrate (Ca-CA). The oil extracted by heat contained the lowest total fatty acids and resulted in the lowest total n-3 PUFAs. Oil extracted by the heat process showed the highest TBA (value 12.24) on 0 day while the lowest thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values were found in the oil extracted with Ca-TA and Ca-CA. A study was conducted to develop an immobilized-​enzyme system to entrap CR lipase in chito-​san-​alginate-​CaCl2 beads for the purpose of concentrating n-3 PUFA from sardine oil. Lipase was immobilized by an ionotropic gelatin method. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that lipase had a strong influence on bead structure. Optimum pH of immobilized lipase shifted to pH 6.0 from that of free lipase (pH 7.0), and immobilized lipase showed higher stability against pH and temperature changes.

Salmon was a mainstay of the Indians' diet, and the tribes of the Columbia River were particularly linked to the fish not only for their food but also as an integral part of their religion and way of life. For millennia Celilo Falls was the great Indian fishery on the mid-Columbia, and it drew Indians there from throughout the West to trade for salmon. But in 1957 the federal government began operation of a giant hydroelectric dam at The Dalles that drowned Celilo Falls and ended the fishery there. Through a combination of rare historic films and photographs, Celilo Falls and the Remaking of the Columbia River provides a glimpse of the life at Celilo as it once was and considers the cultural, social, and political forces that brought about its end, signaling a new era in the relationship between people and nature.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/6053378_2582_2815596.csv,CD,"Gravel extraction is an important economic activity for the coastal economies of Oregon and northern California communities. Coastal development and highway infrastructure are dependent on high-quality gravel, and rapidly increasing transportation costs make long-distance movement of gravel cost-​prohibitive. Therefore, local gravel sources are often utilized to support growth and development in these coastal regions. Over 90% of the gravel extracted is used for making concrete for the construction industry, asphalt for highway construction, drain-rock for sewer and water systems and for road fill. Gravel can be extracted for other reasons than to provide a marketable commodity, including maintenance of channel depth for navigation, irrigation diversion, flood control, and channel stability. Coastal rivers provide high- quality gravel because the softer and more highly fractured rocks do not survive the erosive forces of water and the constant abrasion as they tumble from the headwaters to the ocean. However, gravel extraction in many coastal rivers has been reduced or curtailed because of its effects on both anadromous and resident fishes and their habitats. Such effects can include loss of spawning gravel, reduction in juvenile fish rearing habitats, channel instability, siltation or other water quality issues, and loss of riparian habitats. Impacts of gravel extraction on fish can have both short-term (direct mortality or displacement from habitats during the extraction phase) or long-term cumulative effects on fish and their habitats. Conflicts between gravel extraction interests and the protection of fisheries resources escalate when rivers are inhabited by fish species listed under the Endangered Species Act. As a result, the possibility of generating fish habitat enhancement opportunities while mining gravel through creative extraction planning and permitting flexibility has started to receive increasing attention.

By using fluorescent detection of PCR products obtained after 15 cycles, which was determined to be quantitative, we enriched for BrdU-labeled DNA and did not detect unlabeled DNA. By using pure cultures of Bacteroides vulgatus, the ability of Bacteroidales bacteria to take up and incorporate BrdU into nascent DNA was confirmed.

Using 30 PCR cycles with unlabeled fractions, human-specific Bacteroidales sequences were detected, and they persisted for up to 24 h in sewage.

Distinctive sand sheets were characterized at four localities within the central Cascadia margin, a shoreline distance of about 250 km. The sand sheets vary in thickness from 0.2 to 25 cm. They thin in the landward direction and consist of well-sorted beach sand that fines upsection. Many of the sand sheets include capping layers of organic-rich detritus, as well as assimilated mud rip-up clasts and soil litter. Marine diatoms and bromine (i.e., marine tracers) were used to confirm marine surge origins for the anomalous sand sheets. Radiocarbon dating of the sand sheets demonstrates correspondence with reported great Cascadia earthquake events at 0.3, ~1.1, ~1.3, ~1.7, and ~2.5 Ka. One sand sheet mapped at all four localities is dated at 600-950 calibrated radiocarbon years before present.

Current parasite detection methods involve sentinel fish exposures that are laborious and time-consuming. As a substitute, a filtering protocol and a quantitative real-time TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) assay were developed to detect and enumerate parasite spores in river water. Fluorescence was detected from both the myxospore and actinospore stages of the parasite but not from the fish or polychaete hosts or from 9 other myxozoans tested. Less than 1/1000th of a spore was detected, indicating each had >1000 copies of the target 18S rRNA gene. The assay detected 1 spore in 1 l river water. Inhibition of the assay by some river samples was overcome by reducing the template volume and including bovine serum albumin in the reaction; occasionally a second purification step was required. The QPCR methodology was utilized to investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of C. shasta in the Klamath River, Oregon/Californ​ia. The parasite was detected throughout the river, and 2 of 5 tributaries tested contributed parasites to the mainstem. Correlation of QPCR cycle threshold values with a standard curve for known starting numbers of whole spores revealed several sites where parasite abundance was in excess of 20 spores 1^-1. Although QPCR data corroborated results of sentinel fish exposures, spore numbers did not correlate consistently with mortality in the exposure groups. The water sampling and filtering protocol combined with the QPCR assay is a simple and relatively rapid method for detection and quantification of parasite levels in environmental water samples.","Hallett, Sascha L.;Bartholomew, Jerri L.",ORESU-R-06-010,ORESU-R-06-010,R/RCF-15,reprints (peer-reviewed),2006,Oregon Sea Grant,Application of a real-time PCR assay to detect and quantify the myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa shasta in river water samples,NA,NA,"Diseases of Aquatic Organisms, 71:109-118, July 25, 2006",NA,NA,NA,NA

Samples were collected during a 2-year period in the Tillamook basin in Oregon at 30 sites along five river tributaries and in Tillamook Bay. We performed Bacteroidales PCR assays with general, ruminant-​source-​specific, and human-​source-​specific primers to identify fecal sources. We determined the Escherichia coli most probable number, temperature, turbidity, and 5-day precipitation. Climate and water quality data collectively supported a rainfall runoff pattern for microbial source input that mirrored the annual precipitation cycle. Fecal sources were statistically linked more closely to ruminants than to humans; there was a 40% greater probability of detecting a ruminant source marker than a human source marker across the basin. On a sample site basis, the addition of fecal source tracking data provided new information linking elevated fecal indicator bacterial loads to specific point and nonpoint sources of fecal pollution in the basin. Inconsistencies in E. coli and host-specific marker trends suggested that the factors that control the quantity of fecal indicators in the water column are different than the factors that influence the presence of Bacteroidales markers at specific times of the year. This may be important if fecal indicator counts are used as a criterion for source loading potential in receiving waters.","Shanks, Orin C.;Nietch, Christopher;Simonich, Michael;Younger, Melissa;Reynolds, Don;Field, Katharine G.",ORESU-R-06-011,ORESU-R-06-011,R/ECO-04,reprints (peer-reviewed),2006,Oregon Sea Grant,"Basin-wide analysis of the dynamics of fecal contamination and fecal source identification in Tillamook Bay, Oregon",NA,NA,"""Applied and Environmental Microbiology,"" 72(8):5537-​5546, August 2006.",NA,NA,NA,NA

A study of the prevalence of C. shasta and its geographic and temporal distribution throughout the Klamath River basin was conducted to determine when and where juvenile salmonids encounter lethal parasite doses. Susceptible rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were exposed to C. shasta 3-4 d at seven locations in the Klamath River between Beaver Creek and Keno Reservoir in April, June, July, September, and November 2003. Individuals from a Klamath River strain of fall Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha were held in three locations in the upper Klamath River in April, June, and July. In June 2004, rainbow trout were exposed to the parasite for 4 d at 18 locations from Klamath Lake to the mouth of the Klamath River, including several major spawning tributaries; one exposure occurred in the lower Klamath River. Rainbow trout mortality due to infection for groups exposed in the upper Klamath River was lower (<8.0%) and delayed (mean time to death, 40-110 d) in comparison with that in groups exposed in the lower Klamath River (>98%; mean time to death, 33-36 d). Experimental fall Chinook salmon did not become infected in the upper Klamath River, but infection was detected in Chinook salmon exposed in the lower Klamath River, nearly 50% of these succumbing to infection. These dramatic differences in mortality between the upper and lower Klamath River could not be explained by differences in water temperatures during exposure and are probably a result of differences in infectious dose. Lack of infection in groups exposed in tributaries supports the hypothesis that the parasite life cycle and the invertebrate host are largely confined to the main-stem Klamath River.","Stocking, Richard W.;Holt, Richard A.;Foott, J.

The SFA required Fishery Management Councils to define those waters and substrate necessary for fish for spawning, feeding, or growth to maturity for more than 600 fish stocks and to amend their management plans accordingly by October 1998. Threats to EFH from fishing and nonfishing activities, as well as steps to ameliorate those threats, also had to be identified by October 1998. These requirements unleashed intense habitat-related activity within the councils, agencies of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and interested conservation groups. With the October 1998 deadline in mind, leaders of the American Fisheries Society, Sea Grant, and other agencies decided to sponsor a major symposium of fish habitat research in general and EFH policy in particular. The symposium was held during August 1998 in Hartford, Connecticut. In 27 chapters, this symposium proceedings presents the findings and conclusions of scientists and policy makers who have been working on EFH policy and Sea Grant-funded researchers who have been studying fish habitat. The book presents a wide variety of studies by leading fish habitat researchers. Fisheries biologists from the National Marine Fisheries Service describe the process of EFH identification for mid-Atlantic summer flounder and Pacific Northwest salmon. Remote sensing of fish habitat in Oregon and Florida is covered, as are several studies of fishing gear impacts on fish habitat in the United States and United Kingdom. Threats to habitat and habitat rehabilitation projects are described for estuarine fishes of the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of Maine and for a variety of species including American lobster, spiny lobster, and oysters. A section on Great Lakes habitat includes studies of artificial reefs and pike habitat.

During the early 1960's, these mortalities reached 35 to 50%, prompting an investigation coordinated by the National Marine Fisheries Service in California, Oregon, and Washington (Glude 1975; Katkansky et al. 1972; Scholz et al. 1968, 1971, 1973). The epidemiology of the mortality in the U.S. was similar in character to that described for Matsushima Bay (Imai et al. 1968; Kanno et al. 1965; Koganezawa 1975). High temperatures (18 deg C to 21 deg C) and elevated nutrient levels were associated with these mortalities. Beginning in 1972, the University of Washington College of Fisheries began a study of possible pathogenic organisms and their mode of infection by observing oysters in laboratory- simulated summertime conditions of elevated temperature and nutrient enrichment (Lipovsky and Chew 1972). Mortality was found to be associated with ^iirio-type bacteria. Later studies implicated Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio anguillarum as facultative pathogens (Grischkowsky and Liston 1974) . Since treatment of this disease by use of antibiotics is economically impractical, it was concluded that a logical approach to reducing mortality would be to determine if stocks of oysters could be genetically selected for improved survival during summertime stresses. This study was initiated with the following two objectives: 1) To determine whether resistance to the stress of elevated temperature is a genetically modifiable trait; accomplishment of this would be indicated by significantly greater survival of experimental crosses over imported Japanese stocks at elevated temperatures; 2) To assess the genetic variability within and among experimental crosses using electrophoretic analysis. This would shed light on the nature of inheritance in oysters and might help identify a marker associated with improved survival.","Beattie, J.

In bioassays testing G. stellatus survival times in mucus and serum collected from laboratory held sole at different times during trematode infection, trematode survival times were significantly reduced in serum and mucus samples collected from sole at the later, recovering stages of infection. Ouchterlony gel diffusion tests of rabbit antiserum against English sole serum diffused with English sole mucus samples showed that the mucus of G. stellatus infected English sole contained factors antigenically similar to factors in English sole serum. These factors were not present in the mucus of uninfected sole. Precipitin bands in the gel diffusions tests appeared to be the strongest in mucus samples from sole at later, recovering stages of infection. The results of the serum and mucus bioassays and the Ouchterlony tests suggest the possible presence of resistance factors in both the serum and the mucus of English sole at later stages of trematode infection, and that these factors may result in recovery from the infection. The results also suggest that resistance factors in the mucus may originate from the serum.

It causes the disease piscirickettsio​sis, and is the first rickettsial agent to be implicated in the aetiology of a major fish disease. Piscirickettsio​sis has had a substantial economic impact on the salmonid aquaculture industry of southern Chile. It was first observed there in coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch (Walbaum), held in salt water (Bravo & Campos 1989), and since that time epizootics have predictably occurred at seawater sites in the spring and autumn of the year, when water temperatures are ca 9-16 deg C. However, there is only one report of piscirickettsio​sis in fresh water (Bravo 1994). Piscirickettsio​sis affects all species of salmonids cultured in salt water in southern Chile. In addition to coho salmon, affected fish include rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), and both chinook, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum), and Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. A disease, indistinguishab​le from piscirickettsio​sis, occurs in a chronic form among salmonids cultured at seawater sites in western Canada (Evelyn 1992), in Ireland (Rodger & Drinan 1993) and in Norway (Olsen, Speilberg, Melby & Hastein 1993). The P. salmonis type strain, LF-89 (Fryer et al. 1992), was isolated from a moribund coho salmon collected at a seawater netpen in southern Chile during an epizootic that produced extensive mortality (Fryer, Lannan, Garces, Larenas & Smith 1990). The in vitro characterizatio​n of P. salmonis (Fryer et al. 1990), and elements of the histopathology associated with piscirickettsio​sis (Cvitanich, Garate & Smith 1991) have been described.","Lannan, C.

The response to these stressors was determined during a 24-h recovery period by measuring concentrations of plasma cortisol, lactate, glucose, sodium, and potassium. Lingcod were subjected to brief handling followed by either a 15-min or a 45-min air stressor in the laboratory. After the 15-min stressor, an increase in cortisol or glucose could not be detected until after 5 min of recovery. Peak concentrations were measured after 30 min for cortisol and after 60 min for glucose and lactate. Glucose and lactate had returned to basal levels after 12 h, whereas cortisol did not return to basal levels until after 24 h of recovery. Immediately following a 45-min air stressor, all measured parameters were significantly elevated over levels in prestressor control fish. Cortisol concentrations tended to increase and reached a measured peak after 8 h of recovery, whereas glucose and lactate reached a measured peak after 1 h of recovery. Cortisol and lactate returned to basal levels within 24 h. Glucose, however, remained elevated even after 24 h of recovery. Plasma ions initially increased during the first hour of recovery, and the concentrations then declined to a level below that measured in control fish for the remainder of the 24-h recovery period. In addition, we evaluated the effect of fish size on the stress response. There was no significant difference between the stress response of smaller (41-49-cm [total length]) and larger (50-67-cm) lingcod after 45 min air exposure. In general, both the magnitude and duration of the primary and secondary stress responses in lingcod are comparable to those of salmonids.","Milston, Ruth H.;Davis, Michael W.;Parker, Steven J.;Olla, Bori L.;Clements, Shawn;Schreck, Carl B.",ORESU-R-06-017,ORESU-R-06-017,R/RCF-11,reprints (peer-reviewed),2006,Oregon Sea Grant,Characterizatio​n of the physiological stress response in lingcod,NA,NA,"""Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,"" 135:1165-1174, 2006.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Oral administration of antibiotics using existing microparticle types is not effective due to high leakage rates; furthermore, injection of larvae is not practical. Treatment is currently limited to use of antibiotic baths. In this study, we evaluated lipid spray beads (LSB) for delivery of the low-molecular weight, water-soluble antibiotic, oxytetracycline HCl (OTC) to fish larvae. LSB composed of menhaden stearine have shown good retention of water-soluble core materials and high acceptability by larval fish. Various OTC core-to-lipid ratios and OTC core concentrations were evaluated to maximize OTC delivery efficiencies. Acceptability and digestion of LSB containing riboflavin by larval zebrafish, Danio rerio (Hamilton), and larval gobies, Asterropteryx semipunctata (Ruppell), were also evaluated. Increasing LSB core-to-lipid ratios from 1:3 v/v to 1:1 v/v resulted in an increase of encapsulation efficiency from 2.33% w/w to 3.68% w/w. LSB prepared with a ratio of 1:1.25 v/v were then used to determine the effect of core concentration on encapsulation, retention and delivery efficiencies. Increasing core concentrations from 0.1 to 0.5 g OTC mL-1 H2O caused encapsulation efficiencies to increase from 3.95% w/w to 18.77% w/w, respectively. This increase did not affect retention efficiencies but improved delivery efficiencies. LSB prepared with a core concentration of 0.5 g OTC mL-1 H2O produced the highest delivery efficiencies (7.9 +/- 0.7% w/w) after 60 min aqueous suspension. Acceptability of LSB containing OTC by first-feeding zebrafish and goby larvae was confirmed by analysis of feeding incidence and gut fullness. Visual observations of larvae fed on LSB containing riboflavin indicated that LSB were digested by larvae of both species. Particles were compacted and brightly fluorescent riboflavin filled the gut lumen and exited the anus in plumes. These results suggested that LSB composed of menhaden stearine could be used to deliver OTC to larval fish and may be useful in treating larval fish infected with bacteria susceptible to OTC. Dosage could be controlled by either varying the concentration of administered LSB or the concentration of core solution.","Temple, Ephraim",ORESU-X-07-001,ORESU-X-07-001,R/SAQ-07,theses/disserta​tions,2007,Oregon Sea Grant,Delivering oxytetracycline to first-feeding zebrafish Danio rerio (Hamilton) and goby Asterropteryx semipunctata (Ruppell) larvae using lipid spray beads,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For more than 10,000 years the native peoples of the region lived successfully off the land and waters as hunters, gatherers, and fishers. Salmon was a mainstay of the Indians' diet, and the tribes of the Columbia River were particularly linked to the fish not only for their food but also as an integral part of their religion and way of life. For millennia Celilo Falls was the great Indian fishery on the mid-Columbia, and it drew Indians there from throughout the West to trade for salmon. But in 1957 the federal government began operation of a giant hydroelectric dam at The Dalles that drowned Celilo Falls and ended the fishery there. Through a combination of rare historic films and photographs, Celilo Falls and the Remaking of the Columbia River provides a glimpse of the life at Celilo as it once was and considers the cultural, social, and political forces that brought about its end, signaling a new era in the relationship between people and nature.

To study sugar-protein interaction, the following sugars were used: sorbitol, trehalose and sucrose, and in the place of Protein, Serum Albumin Bovine (BSA, A-7906 Sigma- Aldrich). In some food processes, different sugars are added to protect damage of proteins during their processing, storage and/or distribution. Different sugar/protein solutions were prepared and heated above critical temperature of protein denaturation. OR measurements were performed during heating process and effect of different sugars in protein denaturation was measured. Higher sensitivity of these measurements was found compared with Differential Scanning Calorimetry, which needs higher protein concentration to study these interactions. The brewing fermentation process was monitored in-situ using this OR system and validated by correlation with specific density measurements and gas chromatography. This instrument can be implemented to monitor fermentation on-line, thereby determining end of process and optimizing process conditions in an industrial setting. The high sensitivity of developed OR system has no mobile parts and is more flexible than commercial polarimeters providing the capability of implementation in harsh environments, signifying the potential of this method as an in-line technique for quality control in food processing and for experimentation with optically active solutions.","Mendoza-​Sanchez, Patricia;Lopez, Daniel;Kongraksawech, Teepakorn;Vazquez, Pedro;Torres, J.

Given the growing interest in coastal and ocean ecosystems, one of the popular destinations for Oregon school field trips is rocky intertidal areas along the coast. Currently, no hard data are available on the absolute number of schools visiting rocky intertidal areas for field trips. However, the use of these areas for this purpose is judged to be significant and probably increasing. This study can be considered a ""first step"" in an effort to understand and encourage, but more effectively manage, school group use of Oregon's rocky intertidal areas. Three qualitative methods were used for this project: interviews of park managers and scientists, an on-line teacher survey, and observation of rocky intertidal use by visitors. The interview results show that the majority of school children are not adequately prepared for rocky intertidal field trips, including information about the ecology of the environment, rocky shore safety, and tidepool etiquette. Part of the problem is that there are no uniform procedures requiring teachers to get permission from the agency with rocky shore management responsibility, or requiring park managers and nonprofits to provide consistent guidelines to school groups. A variety of management strategies have been employed successfully at selected coastal sites, but mostly on an ad hoc basis. These techniques, such as area closures, use of local volunteers, and guided walks should be evaluated for possible institutionaliz​ing coast-wide. School group use and impacts need to be managed better because the well-planned and executed rocky intertidal field trip has inherent educational value for its lessons in environmental stewardship. Management should focus on improved (and required) communication between teachers organizing field trips and park staff or nonprofit groups managing the rocky shore and assisting with field trips; development of improved educational materials; and improved record keeping and monitoring that allows for evaluating impacts and carrying capacity. It is hoped that this project will help management agencies to provide appropriate recreational and educational opportunities for visitors specifically school groups, while protecting and conserving rocky shore resources. Recommendations from this study are as follows: Oregon Parks and Recreation Department (OPRD), in cooperation with other relevant agencies and organizations, should convene regular workshops so that parks staff, nonprofits, teachers, and scientists can share information about what works and what does not, be updated on rocky shore ecology and impact studies, identify management needs, develop standard procedures for OPRD management and school group use of rocky intertidal field trip sites. These workshops should be supported by high-level officials in relevant agencies and organizations in order for them to be taken seriously. Such workshops should also be held at times suitable for science teacher attendance, so that those taking rocky shore field trips can attend. Using the above workshops as a vehicle, OPRD, relevant federal agencies, and nonprofits should develop a visitor/school group program to monitor changing use of areas and be alerted to excessive impacts. OPRD, nonprofits involved in intertidal education, and the Oregon Science Teachers Association should establish a formal network to enhance communication between school teachers and rocky intertidal resource managers and promote environmental stewardship and education.","Rawichuttiwan, Angkana",ORESU-X-06-005,ORESU-X-06-005,E/INT-70-PD,theses/disserta​tions,2006,Oregon Sea Grant,School group use of Oregon's rocky intertidal areas: impacts and management,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This leads to increased interaction between management agencies and user groups, frequently occurring through formal public involvement methods and informal interactions. Communication is at the heart of these interactions. In 2004 a small study explored Oregon's coastal marine recreational community and the current state of communication within and between this community and the fisheries management community. The objectives were to understand the methods of communication used, to describe the current state of communication, and to formulate suggestions for improving communication. This publication focuses on factors that affect communication between these communities, and on potential improvements to current communication. It suggests that taking small but important steps toward making effective communication a priority is a good idea for both communities, and can build upon their genuine, mutual concern for the future of the resource.

Analyses of two mitochondrial DNA markers showed little phylogeographic structure across the sampled range, suggesting that this risk is low. Unexpectedly, mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that a second putative species of ghost shrimp frequently coexisted with N. californiensis in southern California intertidal habitats; almost all previous studies of soft-sediment communities in the region report the presence of N. californiensis only.

This study describes the epiphytic community associated with drifting Nereocystis in the South Slough estuary, the placement and conditions of drifters in the South Slough, and a previously undescribed aspect of the Nereocystis life cycle. Data from monthly boat surveys of drifting and attached individuals suggest seasonal epiphytic community changes. The life cycle of Nereocystis includes a diploid, macroscopic sporophyte stage and a haploid, microscopic gametophyte state. Adult sporophytes were found releasing structures that appear to be embryonic sporophytes. The amount of DNA in gametophyte, embryonic sporophyte, and adult sporophyte protoplasts was quantified with DAPI staining and image analysis. The released embryonic sporophytes were diploid and indicate a life history strategy previously unknown in kelps.

Informal education and outreach programs like the Whale Watching Spoken Here program are important contributors to life-long learning. However, there is little research looking at how these programs affect their audiences' knowledge structure, values, beliefs, and activators of behavior, all of which are important precursors to behavior. Since the ultimate goal of these programs is to encourage more environmentally friendly behaviors, an understanding of how these programs affect these cognitive constructs is needed. Based upon several methodological theories, this study looked at the relationship of three precursors to behavior, including visitors' past experiences, value orientations, and their awareness of actions surrounding the marine environment. It further looked at the influence the docent of the outreach program had on visitors' beliefs and conceptual knowledge structure. Lastly, it developed a concept mapping tool that could be used to analyze the conceptual structures of visitors in an informal marine education program. Results revealed that docents of the program did influence people's beliefs and conceptual knowledge structure, and that there was a positive relationship between visitors' past experiences and their value orientations, and a positive relationship between their value orientations and awareness of their actions on the marine environment.

Nearly all the states, as well as the federal government, have issued consumption advice to limit or avoid eating certain fish as the result of high mercury levels. Consumer reaction to consumption advisories, however, is unpredictable. Being voluntary in nature, advisories typically miss their intended audiences, may be misconstrued to apply to non-target species, and may lead to resource waste if landed fish are discarded due to changes in consumer demand. At the current time, no pre-harvest methods are used to control the amount of contaminants that reach fish consumers. Given that mercury bioaccumulates in fish, contamination can vary significantly by size- and/or age class. This suggests that a more directed, size-based management of marine fisheries that explicitly accounts for the economic dynamics of optimal harvesting in the presence of contamination could lead to public health improvements by limiting the amount of mercury that reaches consumers.

From 2004 to 2006, we conducted a field experiment along the Merced River in California's Central Valley to test the influence of distance to groundwater and direct irrigation (two abiotic factors) versus initial plant size and weed competition (two biotic factors) on seedling survival of four native tree species planted in floodplain dredge spoils. Treatment effects on survival were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model. Plant mortality was influenced most strongly by initial planting size in the first year, by irrigation treatment in the second year, and by elevation above groundwater in the third year. Weed competition did not affect survival of any species. In the first year, Box elder and Fremont cottonwood seedling mortality decreased 78 and 19 percent respectively with every 1-mm increase in basal diameter at planting. Similarly, Oregon ash mortality decreased 12 percent per extra centimeter in height. In the second year, irrigated plants survived better than unirrigated ones by 16 to 31 percent across species, and there was no residual effect of initial plant size. In the third year, planting elevation emerged as the most important influence; mortality was 67 to 124 percent higher per meter above the water table. These results are critical for effectively revegetating large areas of floodplain dredge spoils throughout the Central Valley.

Axenic suspension tissue cultures of the alga were contacted with seawater containing PAH in sealed experimental vessels. Uptake time courses and equilibrium partitioning were examined. To determine if uptake was passive or active, equilibrium partitioning was also examined for uptake by heat-killed A. coalita tissue. Additionally, the seawater and biomass were monitored for the formation of PAH metabolites. The two model PAH compounds used in this study were naphthalene and phenanthrene. The results of this study indicate that A. coalita did remove PAH from seawater, but that uptake was passive and the PAH was not metabolized. Both phenanthrene and naphthalene were taken up very quickly by the alga. Equilibrium partitioning between the seawater and biomass was achieved within 24 hours. Additionally, both compounds were found to partition linearly between A. coalita tissues and seawater. A. coalita removed significantly more phenanthrene than naphthalene from the seawater. The equilibrium partition coefficients for phenanthrene and naphthalene partitioning into living A. coalita tissue were 0.171 +/- 0.0083 L/g FW and 0.0500 +/- 0.0025 L/g FW, respectively. Naphthalene partitioning into heat-killed A. coalita tissue was equivalent to naphthalene partitioning into living A. coalita tissue, indicating that uptake was likely passive. No compounds were detected in the seawater or biomass that could be identified as products of PAH degradation.

Photosynthetic activity was monitored by chlorophyll a fluorescence and oxygen evolution rate (OER) to determine the effects of TNT on the microplantlet photosynthetic viability. Microplantlets in 1.1 gFW L-1 suspension effectively removed 100% of TNT from seawater medium at concentrations under 10 mg L-1 within approximately 72 h of exposure. First-order rate constants for TNT uptake were 0.025 to 0.037 L g FW-1 h-1 under both illuminated and dark conditions. Biotransformati​on products of TNT, 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT, were identified as the immediate transformation products. However, these products only accounted for 29% of initial TNT. A mass balance of 14C-labeled TNT in radioisotope tracer studies however, indicated that over 60% of 14C-label taken up by microplantlets was released back into the liquid medium, primarily in the form of polar and ionic metabolites. Polar metabolites were responsible for a change in liquid medium to a yellow color. These metabolites were tentatively identified by mass spectrometry to be Meisenheimer TNT complex (H-TNT) and tetranitro-​hydrazotoluene (TN-HydrazoT) dimerization products. In contrast, only 26% of the 14C-label, primarily as solvent-​extractable compounds, accumulated within the biomass tissue. Furthermore, bound residues of TNT metabolites accounted for less than 5% of initial TNT added. Exposure to TNT inhibited photosynthetic activity in microplantlets by a rapid reversible mechanism. The extent of inhibition was dependent on TNT concentration, with higher concentrations causing permanent damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. A flow-​recirculation bioreactor was developed to monitor real-time oxygen OER of microplantlets exposed to pulse and continuous additions of TNT.

Sporadic summer mortality outbreaks have caused severe financial hardship for oyster aquaculturists for several decades. These outbreaks appear to result from a complex interaction of deleterious environmental conditions with spawning-related energy metabolism and opportunistic infection. Selective breeding programs have been used successfully to produce oyster stocks that survive summer mortality syndrome. These programs are expensive to maintain and require substantial investments of time and effort. The efficiency of breeding programs can be increased by selecting broodstock based upon molecular markers associated with candidate genes for survival and also by using laboratory assays in the hatchery to identify and exclude poor-performing families prior to field evaluation. However, at this time candidate genes have not been identified for use in breeding programs and laboratory assays have not been fully developed. Therefore, the goal of this research was to identify potential candidate genes for improved survival by using cDNA microarrays to compare transcriptome-level responses between oyster families with low or high survival after heat shock, and to determine whether transcription of these candidate genes in juveniles was correlated with subsequent family-level field performance of adults. Overall, the observed patterns of gene transcription were consistent with current literature concerning summer mortality in oysters and marine mussels Mytilus edulis. In two different cohorts of oyster families, transcription levels of the adhesive protein galectin before or after heat shock were higher in families with low (<30%) survival of heat shock, whereas those of the protease inhibitor cystatin B before or after heat shock were greater in families with high (> 65%) survival of heat shock. We found that transcription levels of a number of genes including galectin, heat shock protein 27, and glutathione peroxidase in juveniles were significantly correlated with subsequent family-level survival or growth in the field. We conclude that galectin and cystatin B could be used for marker-aided broodstock selection and that the relationships between gene transcription in juveniles and subsequent family-level performance of adults could be exploited to identify and exclude potentially poor-performing families in the hatchery. These results should facilitate the improvement of selective breeding programs by providing a method of selecting broodstock for traits that are otherwise impractical to measure, and by reducing the costs associated with rearing and evaluating oyster families in the field.","Lang, Paul",ORESU-X-08-001,ORESU-X-08-001,R/SAQ-08-NSI,theses/disserta​tions,2008,Oregon Sea Grant,Identification of candidate genes for survival and their subsequent use in predicting field performance of the farmed Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in coastal water (thesis abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dry-docking was completed in January 1993, and since that time the vessel has been part of the inactive fleet. In this 5-yr period, a dense growth of fouling organisms had developed on the outer surfaces of the hull. Out of concern that the fouled hull could become a source for the introduction of alien aquatic nuisance species to Hawaiian waters, an evaluation of the fouling community was conducted. In this study we found 116 taxa among 12 phyla in 10 samples scraped from the vessel's hull. Seventy-six species were identified: 11 known from Hawaiian waters, 17 with known temperate-​boreal distributions, and the remaining 48 known only from the Pacific Northwest. Forty percent of the taxa in this fouling community were not identified to species, so there remained some potential for alien species introduction. As a precaution to prevent accidental introductions, the ship was moved from Bremerton to the Columbia River in Oregon for a %day sojourn in freshwater before its transoceanic crossing to Pearl Harbor. Inspection of the vessel's hull upon arrival in Pearl Harbor revealed more than 90% of the hull to be completely clear of any fouling organisms. Only I1 species were found to be alive: 3 species probably recruited to the hull on the transoceanic crossing that may routinely arrive in Hawaiian waters, 4 species already present in Hawai'i, 3 Pacific Northwest species that appeared to be close to death on their arrival in Hawai'i, and 2 euryhaline amphipod species probably recruited to the hull while in the Columbia River. The amphipods were not reproductive and brooding young, suggesting that these species would not be successful colonists. A final inspection and sampling of the hull 83 days after arriving at Pearl Harbor failed to find live or dead Columbia River amphipods nor were the three Pacific Northwest species alive. Freshwater exposure for 9 days coupled with increased water temperatures during the journey to Hawai'i appear to be an extremely effective means of eliminating the temperate marine fouling community.

Skeletal muscle concentrations of the steroid hormones testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) predicted similar, but slightly smaller sizes at maturity than morphological criteria. Stage of maturity for males was estimated identically using internal organs or external secondary sexual characters, thus allowing non-lethal maturity assessments. Peak parturition occurred from May through October, with increased concentrations of E2 and progesterone (P4) in skeletal muscle of females correlating with ovarian recrudescence during November through February. Extrapolation of the hypothesized 6 to 8 mo egg-laying season to observed mean parturition rates of captive specimens yielded an estimated annual fecundity of 19.5 to 28.9 egg cases. Differences in fecundity among higher taxonomic classifications of chondrichthyans were detected, with chimaeriform fishes more fecund than myliobatiform, squaliform, and rhinobatiform fishes. Delta-lognormal generalized linear models (GLMs) and cluster analysis indicated the presence of two distinct stocks of H. colliei on the U.S. West Coast. Abundance of the continental slope, and northern continental shelf and upper slope populations did not vary between 1977 and 1995, but increased from 1995 to 2006. Abundance trends in the southern shelf and upper slope region were not as straightforward​, with increasing abundance from 1977 to 1986, and lesser abundance thereafter, with the exception of an increase between 1992 and 1995. Although the life history, movement patterns, and aggregative behavior of H. colliei indicated that it may be vulnerable to population depletion by excess fisheries mortality, temporal abundance trends indicated that their population size has increased significantly within the last decade. The paradigm that all chondrichthyans are particularly susceptible to exploitation, therefore, may not apply to chimaeroids. The hypothesis that the dorsal-fin spine of H. colliei is a reliable structure for age estimation was tested by analyzing growth characteristics and imaging with polarized light microscopy and micro-computed tomography. Variation among individuals in the relationship between spine width and distance from the spine tip indicated the technique of transverse sectioning may impart imprecision and bias to age estimates. The number of growth band pairs observed by light microscopy in the inner dentine layer was not a good predictor of body size. Mineral density gradients, indicative of growth zones, were not observed in the H. colliei dorsal-fin spine, but were present in hard parts used for age determination of the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), roughtail skate (Bathyraja trachura), and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). The absence of mineral density gradients in the dorsal-fin spine of H. colliei decreases the likelihood that the bands observed by light microscopy represent a record of growth with consistent periodicity.","Barnett, Lewis A.K.",CASG-Y-08-001,NA,NA,theses/disserta​tions,2008,California Sea Grant,"Life history, abundance, and distribution of the spotted ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

No prior studies have assessed exposure from ingestion among surfing populations. This study estimated the magnitude and frequency of incidental water ingestion using a Web-based survey and integrated exposure distributions with enterococci distributions to predict the probability of GI illness at six Oregon beaches. The mean exposure magnitude and frequency were 170 ml of water ingested per day and 77 days spent surfing per year, respectively. The mean number of enterococci ingested ranged from approximately 11 to 86 colony-forming units (CFU) per day. Exposure-​response analyses were conducted using an ingested dose model and two epidemiological models. Risk was characterized using joint probability curves (JPC). At the most contaminated beach, the annualized ingested dose model estimated a mean 9% probability of a 50% probability of GI illness, similar to the results of the first epidemiological model (mean 6% probability of a 50% probability of GI illness). The second epidemiological model predicted a 23% probability of exceeding an exposure equivalent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maximum acceptable GI illness rate (19 cases/1000 swimmers). While the annual risk of GI illness for Oregon surfers is not high, data showed that surfers ingest more water compared to swimmers and divers and need to be considered in regulatory and public health efforts, especially in more contaminated waters.

Pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry (PAM) and oxygen measurements were used to measure photosynthetic activity during the first few hours after rehydration under various light intensities and salinities. Upon rehydration, a transitory maximum in respiratory activity (10-30 min) occurred before the resumption of photosynthesis, which could recover in about 2 h. Salinities outside the mats' natural range (35-50 psu) were detrimental to photosynthetic recovery. Both high (100 psu) and low (0-10 psu) salinities slowed recovery as well as lowered the overall photosynthetic yield. Photosynthesis was initiated earlier and recovered more rapidly with increasing light intensity. In addition, the positive effect of light on rates of recovery was disproportionat​ely greater at lower salinities (10-25 psu) where high light (500 W . m -2) counteracted the negative effects of low-salt stress early in recovery. However, higher light intensities became photo-​inhibitory later in recovery (>2 h). Photosynthesis did not recover uniformly within the mat.

With the required UVA radiation included, Nostoc synthesized three to seven times more scytonemin while fixing nitrogen than when utilizing nitrate or ammonium. A similar increase in scytonemin synthesis occurred when nitrate or ammonium became depleted by growth and Nostoc switched to diazotrophic metabolism with the differentiation of heterocysts. In addition, UVA-exposed cultures grown in medium with both NO2 and NH+4 synthesized some scytonemin but synthesis increased when NH+4 was depleted and growth had become dependent on NO-3 reduction. Although the mechanism is unclear, these results suggest that the greater the restriction in nitrogen accessibility, the greater the production of scytonemin. Perhaps the entire response may be an interaction between this restriction and a resultant sensitivity of UV radiation that acts as a cue for determining the level of scytonemin synthesis. Scytonemin is a stable UVR screening compound and appears to be synthesized by cyanobacteria as a long-term solution for reducing UVR exposure and damage, but mainly or solely, when metabolic activity is absent.

Based upon data generated by the microarray and by real-time quantitative PCR, we found that transcription after heat shock increased for genes putatively encoding heat shock proteins and genes for proteins that synthesize lipids, protect against bacterial infection, and regulate spawning, whereas transcription decreased for genes for proteins that mobilize lipids and detoxify reactive oxygen species.

The biosynthesis of scytonemin is encoded by a previously identified gene cluster that is present in six cyanobacterial species whose genomes are available. A comparison of these clusters reveals that two major cluster architectures exist which appear to have evolved through rearrangements of large sections, such as those genes responsible for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and through insertion of genes that potentially confer additional biosynthetic capabilities. Differential transcriptional expression analysis demonstrated that the entire gene cluster is transcribed in higher abundance after exposure of UV radiation. This analysis helps delineate the cluster boundaries and indicates that regulation of this cluster is controlled by the presence or absence of UV radiation.

The conclusion drawn from this preliminary investigation is that future efforts to understand and support the public's understanding of science will require approaches that take into account individual differences and the unique personal and context-​specific nature of knowledge; findings also support the value of asset-based approaches to education which build from strengths rather than dwelling upon deficits.","Falk, John H.;Storksdieck, Martin;Dierking, Lynn D.",ORESU-R-07-024,ORESU-R-07-024,E/UED-03;R/UED-03,reprints (peer-reviewed),2007,Oregon Sea Grant,Investigating public science interest and understanding: evidence for the importance of free-choice learning,NA,NA,"""Public Understanding of Science,"" 16:455-469, 2007 [doi: 10.1177/0963662​506064240].",NA,10.1177/0963662​506064240,NA,NA

Many investigators have sought to describe why people visit museums, resulting in a range of descriptive categorizations​. Recently, investigators have begun to document the connections between visitors' entering motivations and exiting learning. Doering and Pekarik have proposed starting with the idea that visitors are likely to enter a museum with an ""entry narrative"" (1996; see also Pekarik, Doering and Karns 1999). Doering and Pekarik argue that these entry narratives are likely to be self-​reinforcing, directing both learning and behavior, since visitors' perceptions of satisfaction will be directly related to experiences that resonate with their entering narrative. Falk took these ideas one step further and proposed that-although people have diverse reasons for choosing to visit museums-these diverse reasons tended to cluster around a relatively small number of motivational categories (2006). These categories appeared to be related to visitors' desires to use the museum for fulfilling identity-​related needs. Each of us assumes many identities over the course of our life. Some of our identities are enduring and long-lasting; others are more ephemeral and situation-​specific; all help us navigate through the complexities of life.","Falk, John H.;Heimlich, Joseph;Bronnenkant, Kerry",ORESU-R-08-012,ORESU-R-08-012,E/UED-03;R/UED-03,reprints (peer-reviewed),2008,Oregon Sea Grant,Using identity-​related visit motivations as a tool for understanding adult zoo and aquarium visitors' meaning-making,NA,NA,"""Curator,"" 51(1):55-79, 2008.",NA,NA,NA,NA

In Southern California many recreational anglers favor live ghost shrimp as bait for marine fishes. This demand is met in part by importing live N. californiensis from Oregon and Washington, where they are considered pests. As with trade in most marine live baits in California, this market is effectively unregulated. We evaluated two potential risks associated with the transport of northern ghost shrimp into southern populations. First, we addressed the hypothesis that there are significant genetic differences between northern and southern populations; introduction of northern ghost shrimp into Southern California waters might tend to homogenize such genetic diversity. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing a fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene in seven ghost shrimp populations from sites spanning much of the species' range. Second, some imported ghost shrimp purchased at Southern California bait shops parasitized by brooding bopyrid isopods, Ione cornuta. These parasites tend to castrate their hosts, and some related species have major impacts on host population ecology. Surveys of natural populations, the holdings of west coast natural history museums, and the literature suggest that I. cornuta's southern range limit is Monterey Bay; thus use of northern ghost shrimp as live bait may result in release of non-native parasites into Southern California waters. Our results highlight risks associated with the common practice of transporting live marine bait across biogeographic boundaries.","Llaban, A. S.;Archie, J.

Marine Vibrio spp. produce an array of extracellular products as potential pathogenicity factors. Culture supernatants of V. tubiashii have been shown to be toxic to oyster larvae and were reported to contain a metalloprotease and a cytolysin/hemol​ysin. However, the structural genes responsible for these proteins have yet to be identified, and it is uncertain which extracellular products play a role in pathogenicity. We investigated the effects of the metalloprotease and hemolysin secreted by V. tubiashii on its ability to kill Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae. While V. tubiashii supernatants treated with metalloprotease inhibitors severely reduced the toxicity to oyster larvae, inhibition of the hemolytic activity did not affect larval toxicity. We identified structural genes of V. tubiashii encoding a metalloprotease (vtpA) and a hemolysin (vthA). Sequence analyses revealed that VtpA shared high homology with metalloprotease​s from a variety of Vibrio species, while VthA showed high homology only to the cytolysin/hemol​ysin of Vibrio vulnificus. Compared to the wild-type strain, a VtpA mutant of V. tubiashii not only produced reduced amounts of protease but also showed decreased toxicity to C. gigas larvae. Vibrio cholerae strains carrying the vtpA or vthA gene successfully secreted the heterologous protein. Culture supernatants of V. cholerae carrying vtpA but not vthA were highly toxic to Pacific oyster larvae. Together, these results suggest that the V. tubiashii extracellular metalloprotease is important in its pathogenicity to C. gigas larvae.","Hasegawa, Hiroaki;Lind, Erin J.;Boin, Markus A.;Hase, Claudia C.",ORESU-R-08-013,ORESU-R-08-013,R/SAQ-15-PD,reprints (peer-reviewed),2008,Oregon Sea Grant,The extracellular metalloprotease of Vibrio tubiashii is a major virulence factor for Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae,NA,NA,"""Applied and Environmental Microbiology,"" 74(13):4101-​4110, July 2008 [doi: 10.1128/AEM.000​61-​08].",NA,10.1128/AEM.000​61-​08,NA,NA

Experiments were designed to observe the structure's effect on the bore as well as the bore's effect on the structure. This comprehensive study used highly repeatable experiments to measure water-surface variations, velocity flow fields, and forces exerted by bores on vertically erected columns. The temporal and spatial variations of the water-surface elevations were quantified with a Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) technique; velocity flow fields were recorded with a combination of Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) and Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV); forces on the columns were measured with a miniature load-cell transducer.

The mean days to death (MDD) did not significantly decrease among doses causing 100% prevalence, indicating a minimum time required for parasites to replicate to a fatal level. When dose was constant, but delivered in a higher parasite concentration, higher infection prevalence and mortality resulted. One actinospore fish-1 caused 57% infection and mortality in fish challenged in 0.5 l of water, whereas 10 spores fish-1 resulted in an average of 49% infection and mortality in 1 l challenges. This effect is most likely due to a higher encounter rate in the smaller water volume. Neither infection prevalence nor MDD was significantly different between large trout (84.9 g) and small trout (6.3 g). Chinook salmon did not become infected even when challenged with 5000 actinospores. One fatal infection occurred in coho salmon challenged with 1000 actinospores. This study confirms that even low doses of C. shasta cause severe infection in highly susceptible fish, describes the dose response on MDD, and demonstrates that parasite concentration influences infection prevalence.","Bjork, Sarah J.;Bartholomew, Jerri L.",ORESU-R-09-008,ORESU-R-09-008,R/RCF-24,reprints (peer-reviewed),2009,Oregon Sea Grant,Effects of Ceratomyxa shasta dose on a susceptible strain of rainbow trout and comparatively resistant Chinook and coho salmon,NA,NA,"""Diseases of Aquatic Organisms,"" 86:29-37, September 2009 [doi: 10.3354/dao0209​2].",NA,10.3354/dao0209​2,NA,NA

Herein, we explored how hypoxia can influence the horizontal and vertical distribution of pelagic fish, as well as their overlap with mesozooplankton prey in the northern Gulf of Mexico, an area with extensive seasonal hypoxia. Using an undulating Scanfish sensor package (with CTD and optical plankton counter) towed in parallel with a split-beam acoustics system, we simultaneously collected water temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, mesozooplankton biomass, and relative fish biomass density data along transects (day and night) during 2003, 2004, and 2006. We used spatial analytical techniques to account for intercorrelatio​n and spatial autocorrelation in data and to discern patterns in the distribution of pelagic organisms. We observed low fish biomass in hypoxic waters, with fish aggregating horizontally at the edges of hypoxic areas. Fish also aggregated immediately above hypoxic bottom waters, but only during years of severe hypoxia. Spatial overlap between fish biomass and mesozooplankton biomass was high during mild hypoxia, but reduced during years of severe hypoxia. Consistent with other coastal systems such as Chesapeake Bay and the Neuse River Estuary, our findings ultimately suggest that hypoxia can reduce the availability of quality habitat for zooplanktivorou​s fish in the northern Gulf of Mexico by reducing access to bottom habitat and mesozooplankton prey.","Zhang, Hongyan;Ludsin, Stuart A.;Mason, Doran M.;Adamack, Aaron T.;Brandt, Stpehen B.;Zhang, Xinsheng;Kimmel, David G.;Roman, Michael R.;Boicourt, William C.",ORESU-R-09-010,ORESU-R-09-010,M/A-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2009,Oregon Sea Grant,Hypoxia-driven changes in the behavior and spatial distribution of pelagic fish and mesozooplankton in the northern Gulf of Mexico,NA,NA,"""Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,"" 381:S80-S91, 2009 [doi: 10.1016/j.jembe​.2009.07.014].",NA,10.1016/j.jembe​.2009.07.014,NA,NA

Here, we demonstrate that the concomitant expression of both V. tubiashii genes resulted in significantly higher haemolytic activity than the vthA gene alone. In addition, we created a VthAB- mutant strain of V. tubiashii that was virtually devoid of haemolytic activity in liquid media. Interestingly, significant production of an additional haemolysin(s) was observed on blood plates. Moreover, we have previously reported that in V. tubiashii, proteolytic and haemolytic activities are inversely produced during bacterial growth. Here, we study this correlation in more detail and present evidence that the VtpA metalloprotease inhibits haemolytic activity in culture supernatants, based on the following evidence: (i) loss of metalloprotease activity by either mutation or EDTA inhibition resulted in increased haemolytic activity; (ii) overexpression of the vtpA gene resulted in decreased haemolytic activity; (iii) purified VtpA metalloprotease directly diminished haemolytic activity by purified VthA haemolysin. Importantly, we found not only that vthAB gene expression remained high throughout growth but also that there were no dramatic differences in vthAB gene expression between the parent and VtpA- mutant strains.

We identified a protein that belongs to the TetR family of transcriptional regulators, VtpR, which showed high homology with V. cholerae HapR. We conclude that VtpR activates VtpA production based on the following: (i) a VtpR-deficient V. tubiashii mutant did not produce extracellular proteases, (ii) the mutant showed reduced expression of a vtpA-lacZ fusion, and (iii) VtpR activated vtpA-lacZ in a V. cholerae heterologous background. Moreover, we show that VtpR activated the expression of an additional metalloprotease gene (vtpB). The deduced VtpB sequence showed high homology with a metalloprotease​, VhpA, from V. harveyi. Furthermore, the vtpR mutant strain produced reduced levels of extracellular hemolysin, which is attributed to the lower expression of the V. tubiashii hemolysin genes (vthAB).

The author studied juvenile Chinook diet and prey resources, and modeled growth potential in 10 natural marshes and 1 recently restored marsh along the Oregon coast in 2003-04. Juvenile Chinook foraging patterns showed a wide variation among different sites. Although many diets showed a similar mix of species, dominated by Corophium spp. and chironomids, Chinook at a few sites fed almost entirely on prey that was rarely found elsewhere. Although among emergent marshes, prey resource composition appeared to be similar, scrub-shrub marshes tended to have large numbers of collembolans. Both species richness and abundance were lowest early in the season. The bioenergetics model showed differences of greater than an order of magnitude among marshes and in the same marsh over time. Emergent marshes with a lower surface elevation had the highest average growth potentials, followed by high emergent and scrub-shrub marshes.","Bieber, Alisa J.",ORESU-Y-05-001,ORESU-Y-05-001,R/ECO-02;R/ECO-02(C),theses/disserta​tions,2005,Oregon Sea Grant,Variability in juvenile Chinook foraging and growth potential in Oregon estuaries: implications for habitat restoration: (master's thesis),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dikes installed in three locations in the estuary during the early 1960s were removed in 1978, 1987 and 1996 creating a ""space-for-time substitution"" chronosequence. I analyzed marsh community response to assess development state of three recovering marshes and make comparisons with the reference. During spring and summer from 1998-2002, I assessed juvenile salmon habitat development by comparing wild Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Chinook salmon) density, diet composition and modeled growth potential among marshes. I also explored differences in invertebrate abundance and composition among marshes, and determined repeatable and exclusive indicators to marsh age. In my analysis, I applied techniques, such as bioenergetics modeling and indicator analysis, to evaluate ecosystem development. A bioenergetics model was used to compare growth potential with site-specific diet composition and temperature, estuary-​specific prey energy, average fish size and calculated consumption rates. Modeled growth potential was positive, ranged from 0.001-0.07 g/g/d, and was unrelated to marsh age. Growth rates approximating the reference were found in the newest restoration site with higher variability. Density and taxonomic richness of benthic macroinvertebra​tes was related to marsh age, but unrelated in marsh surface insects. Invertebrate communities were also compared among marshes. Benthic communities in the 1996 marsh were different from all other marshes, and insect communities were distinct by site except for several cases when no difference between the reference and the 1978 marsh was found. Using indicator analysis I determined several reliable indicators of marsh age, including Staphylinidae (rove beetles) and Chironomidae larvae (midge flies) in the 1996 marsh. Insect communities were more affected by landscape positioning than benthic communities, but tracking both, and evaluating the key indicators of community response was the most informative for describing and assessing recovery state across marsh conditions. The range of metrics I used to track ecosystem development at the Salmon River estuary provided broad indication as to the state of ecosystem re-development after restoring tidal inundation and revealed differences among the marshes related to landscape position and marsh age.","Gray, Ayesha",ORESU-Y-05-002,ORESU-Y-05-002,R/ECO-02;R/ECO-02(C);R/ECO-14,theses/disserta​tions,2005,Oregon Sea Grant,The Salmon River estuary: restoring tidal inundation and tracking ecosystem response: (dissertation),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, few studies have investigated estuarine use by coastal cutthroat trout and it is often thought that estuaries serve primarily as migration corridors rather than rearing areas. We used both PIT tag and acoustic tracking techniques in 2002 and 2003 to investigate habitat use, movement, and life history variation within the population of coastal cutthroat trout in the Salmon River estuary, Oregon. Evidence of site fidelity was observed in both the PIT-tagged and acoustically tagged fish, with 70% of PIT tagged fish being recaptured at their previous capture site and most acoustically tagged fish residing in one location for at least 25 days. Ninety percent of fish relocated 1.7 km upstream or downstream showed directional movement toward the original site of capture, and half of those eventually took up residence there. Cutthroat trout used main channel sites more frequently than marsh channel sites, and deeper sites more frequently than shallower sites. Contrary to published results for most other coastal populations, Salmon River cutthroat trout rear in the estuary for much of the year. We identified two main life history types: an ""ocean migrant"" form that migrates rapidly through the estuary and out to sea, and an ""estuarine resident"" form that resides in the estuary for the spring and summer. In addition, we found evidence of other life history types: coastal cutthroat trout that rear mainly in the estuary but make brief forays into the near shore ocean, and some that rear in the estuary throughout winter. We saw no difference in mean length at tagging between ocean migrants and estuarine residents, suggesting that the stimulation for migrating to the ocean was not size related. Half of the acoustically tagged fish exhibited the estuarine life history type. We compared growth rates of ocean migrants and estuarine residents by classifying PIT-tagged fish into life history types based on their recapture history. We found no evidence of a growth advantage for ocean migrants, although sample size was small. This study suggests that the estuarine life history is an important migratory behavior within the continuum of life histories for coastal cutthroat trout in the Salmon River. Our results imply that conservation of coastal cutthroat trout may depend on recovery and maintenance of suitable estuarine rearing habitat.","Krentz, Lisa K.",ORESU-Y-07-001,ORESU-Y-07-001,E/INT-49;R/ECO-02(C);R/ECO-14,theses/disserta​tions,2007,Oregon Sea Grant,"Habitat use, movement, and life history variation of coastal cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii in the Salmon River estuary, Oregon: (master's thesis)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Invasive species are increasingly causing economic and ecosystem harm in Oregon. This is among the first studies done on the human dimensions of invasive species. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework, the attitudes, norms and perceived behavioral controls regarding preventative behaviors were elucidated during four focus groups (29 individuals) with individual groupings of gardeners, anglers, hunters and boaters. Findings indicate six belief barriers to changing hobby behaviors. These include 1) the attitude that preventative behaviors, such as using pesticides, may be worse for the environment than invasive species, 2) the attitude that the fight against invasive species is a losing battle, 3) the norm belief that institutions don't care enough to prioritize action on the issue of invasive species, 4) the norm belief that the general public both doesn't know and doesn't care about invasive species, 5) the behavioral control belief that one doesn't know enough about the preventative behaviors to be effective, and 6) the behavioral control belief that preventative behaviors are too difficult to perform. Understanding the beliefs that prevent changes in behavior will help inform the creation of effective statewide invasive species awareness and actions campaigns, such as that being led by the Oregon Invasive Species Council, as well as provide a foundation of research on which to build additional research.

Using focus groups comprised of key educators, this study seeks to identify attitudes, norms, and barriers to inform the development of solutions to mitigate the spread of aquatic invasive species from the classroom. A modified version of the Theory of Planned Behavior is used to tabulate values, knowledge, concerns, and solutions that could lead to behavioral change.

(2) Create example fact sheets for organism suppliers and encourage their adoption by the suppliers. (3) Add invasive species educational standards on a national scale through the NSTA and NISC, and provide teachers with curriculum suggestions involving the integration of invasive species education into core subject matter.

We measured survival of two commonly sold bait species and one associated parasite in three temperature treatments, simulating minimum (12�C), average (16�C), and maximum (25�C) temperatures of southern California coastal habitats. Bloodworms (Glycera sp.) from Maine, lugworms (Perinereis sp.) from Korea, and a potentially non-indigenous parasitic isopod (Ione cornuta) infecting bait ghost shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis) from Oregon and Washington, were exposed to temperature treatments for five days.

In the warmer temperature treatment, >75% of Glycera sp. individuals survived, while <50% of the Perinereis sp. and I. cornuta individuals survived. Although we observed a decrease in survival in warmer temperature conditions (typically found only in shallow-water habitats partially isolated from the ocean such as estuaries and lagoons) our results suggest that short term survival of these species is not restricted by thermal conditions in southern California.

After examining nine sites, we produced reconstructions for ﬁve mid-order rivers and four salmon species over a large geographic range in the Pacific Northwest: chinook (O. tschwatcha) in the Umpqua River, Oregon, USA; sockeye (O. nerka) in Drinkwater Creek, British Columbia, Canada; pink (O. gorbuscha) in Sashin Creek, southeastern Alaska, USA; chum (O. keta) in Disappearance Creek, southeastern Alaska, USA; and pink and chum in the Kadashan River, southeastern Alaska, USA. We ﬁrst derived stand-level, non-climatic growth chronologies from riparian trees using standard dendroecology methods and differencing. When the chronologies were compared to 18-55 years of adult salmon escapement we detected positive, significant correlations at five of the nine sites. Regression models relating escapement to tree- ring growth at the five sites were applied to the differenced chronologies to reconstruct salmon abundance. Each reconstruction contains unique patterns characteristic of the site and salmon species. Reconstructions were validated by comparison to local histories (e.g., construction of dams and salmon canneries) and regional ﬁsheries data such as salmon landings and aerial surveys and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation climate index. The reconstructions capture lower- frequency cycles better than extremes and are most useful for determination and comparison of relative abundance, cycles, and the effects of interventions. Reconstructions show lower population cycle maxima in both Umpqua River Chinook and Sashin Creek pink salmon in recent decades. The Drinkwater Creek reconstruction suggests that sockeye abundance since the mid-1990s has been 15-25% higher than at any time since 1850, while no long-term deviations from natural cycles are detected for salmon in the Kadashan River or in Disappearance Creek. Decadal-scale cycles in salmon abundance with periods of 25-68 years were detected in all of the reconstructions​.

Mark-recapture studies and abundance patterns in the estuary during 2000-2002 describe the following life-history types among Chinook salmon: (1) fry disperse throughout the estuary, and many move into restored tidal- marsh habitats in the early spring soon after emergence; (2) juveniles reside in freshwater for several months, enter the estuary in June or July, and remain for (a) a few weeks or (b) several months before entering the ocean; and (3) juveniles enter the ocean later in the fall after an extended period of rearing upriver and/or in the estuary. The absence of fry migrants in the estuary during spring and early summer in 1975-1977 d a period that precedes restoration of any of the diked marshes d and the extensive use of marsh habitats by fry and fingerlings April - July, 2000-2002 indicate that wetland restoration has increased estuarine rearing opportunities for juvenile Chinook salmon. Year-to-year patterns of estuarine rearing and abundance by juvenile salmon may be influenced by flood and drought conditions that affected adult spawner distribution and over-winter survival of salmon eggs. However, persistent changes in spawner distribution since 1975-1977, including the concentration of hatchery strays in the lower river, may account for the large proportion of fry that now disperse into the estuary soon after emergence in the spring. Although few of these earliest migrants survived to the river mouth, many fry and fingerlings from mid- and upper-basin spawning areas distributed throughout a greater portion of the estuary during the spring and summer and migrated to the ocean over a broader range of sizes and time periods than thirty years ago.

For example, the drought-induced sudden marsh dieback of 2000 left over 40,000 ha of Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh in Louisiana nearly devoid of vegetation. Although much of the affected salt marsh recovered naturally, nearly 7,000 ha were converted to perpetual mudflat due to sediment surface subsidence caused by compaction, dewatering, erosion, and prevailing decompositional processes following plant morality. In an effort to restore an area of degraded marsh turned mudflat, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (LDNR) pumped a slurry of hydraulically dredged sediment on to a dieback affected salt marsh to raise the surface elevation and provide more suitable conditions for vegetation recolonization. The irregular distribution of sediments created surface elevations that ranged from 13 to 36 cm above the surrounding unaffected reference marsh. Over a three period, we measured surface elevation change, sediment accretion, soil organic matter accumulation, and soil bulk density in areas that received either low (+13-18 cm), medium (+20-25 cm), or high (+28-36 cm) sediment intensities to determine the elevation range at which marsh function was restored. Our results show that all sediment-​amended areas had less soil organic matter than the unaffected reference areas. Areas that received medium or high sediment intensities also had higher soil bulk density, lower rates of sediment accretion, and less elevation gain when compared to unaffected reference marsh. However, elevation change, sediment accretion, and soil bulk density were similar between the low intensity sediment-​amended areas and the unaffected reference marsh. Based on these results, we conclude that the low-intensity sediment-slurry amendment created conditions that facilitated recovery of salt marsh accretionary processes in the short-term.","Graham, S.

The respiration measurements showed a strong river influence, with highest R inshore and near the river. Experiments and modeling showed considerable complexity in deriving P estimates from oxygen measurements, and a new method is proposed for estimating minimum PIR ratios from oxygen isotope measurements. Combining the PIR and R estimates yielded conservative (minimum) estimates of P across the shelf system, with P showing strong river forcing. Average R in surface and bottom waters was respectively 19 and 9 mmol m-3/day, average P/R was 1.0, and average P in surface waters was 20 mmol m-3/day.

Although numerous sources such as aging sewage systems and agricultural runoff contribute pollutants to recreational areas; due to the complexity of the watershed where these sources reside, past studies ignored its influences on coastal beaches.

With the aid of a four-​dimensional, data-​visualization tool (which locates the sources of pollution), also developed during this study; an Early Warning System for beach closure events was developed as a function of antecedent rainfall, runoff, wind direction, and watershed air temperatures.

We had three primary study objectives: 1) examine redband trout spawning locations and spawning migration timing, 2) evaluate redband trout passage at diversion dams, and 3) investigate seasonal migration patterns of redband trout as they relate to stream temperature dynamics. We tagged 96 redband trout with radio transmitters and 706 with PIT tags. Radio tracking included both mobile and fixed station detections. We established PIT tag readers at Cato Bridge (Rkm 1), Busse Dam (Rkm 35), Grain Camp Dam (Rkm 48), and Page Dam (Rkm 76) for additional data on large-scale movement patterns. With the PIT antennas at the three diversion dams, we placed one antenna below the dam and one at the upstream exit of the fish ladders to evaluate the passage delays at each dam. Stream temperature was recorded at 10 locations in the Blitzen River throughout the study. Scales of 257 migratory trout were interpreted for age and spawning history. Our results indicated that the majority of Blitzen redband trout migrated upstream of Page Dam to spawn and that most trout spawned in the mainstem and not the tributaries. Upstream trout migration occurred from March to July, but the peak migration occurred during late April and early May. Passage problems were recorded at two of the three dams evaluated. Trout were delayed longest at Busse Dam and 44% of radio-tagged trout that approached the dam were never able to pass. Trout experienced less delay at Grain Camp Dam and only 8% of radio-tagged trout failed to pass the dam. At Page Dam, which has a recently upgraded fish ladder, trout delays were short and only 5% of trout that approached the dam were unable to pass. Potentially stressful or lethal temperatures (>24.3�C) were recorded at all monitoring locations downstream of Fish Creek, except at the site just below Page Springs. The migratory population ranged in age from 1+ to 5+, but only age 3+ and older trout were reproductively mature. This suggests that the spring upstream migration includes both adult trout seeking suitable spawning habitats and immature trout making a seasonal habitat shift for thermal refuge. A fraction of the PIT-tagged fish were observed to make two or three migrations from below Busse Dam to above Page Dam in the spring and returning back to the lower river in the fall. We recommend prioritizing fish passage at the Busse Dam and Grain Camp Dam for conservation and enhancement efforts.","Anderson, Mathew;Giannico, Guillermo;Jacobs, Steve",ORESU-T-09-002,ORESU-T-09-002,A/ESG-07,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2009,Oregon Sea Grant,"Migration and passage of redband trout in the Donner und Blitzen River, 2007-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The samples were filtered, and the captured DNA was extracted and tested for the presence of P. minibicornis with the duplex QPCR assay. The parasite was present throughout the river over the entire sampling period, but its distribution and abundance varied spatially and temporally by over 2 orders of magnitude. Spore densities were lowest in March (spring) and peaked in June/July (summer) when site variance was also greatest. Inhibition levels also varied.

To better understand how hypoxia influences the interaction and spatial overlap between planktivorous fishes (e.g., bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli) and their mesozooplankton prey (e.g., Acartia tonsa), we contrasted the spatial distributions of these food-web components along the Bay's entire north-south axis during spring, summer, and fall 1996, 1997, and 2000, and along several cross-Bay transects during summer of these same years. Pelagic fish biomass was estimated with a surface-towed split-beam echosounder. Dissolved oxygen and mesozooplankton biomass were simultaneously quantified using a towed, undulating ScanFish sensor package. Results indicate that hypoxia can disrupt the diel vertical migration behavior of planktivorous fishes in Chesapeake Bay during summer by reducing access to bottom waters and forcing fish to reside in well-oxygenated surface or nearshore waters. In turn, reduced access to bottom waters reduces spatial overlap with mesozooplankton prey, which appear to use the hypoxic zone as a refuge.

We hypothesized that hypolimnetic hypoxia would negatively affect yellow perch by limiting access to benthic prey and preferred (cool) temperatures. To explore how hypoxia influences yellow perch foraging and migration patterns in central Lake Erie, we collected a suite of biological (i.e., fish with bottom and mid-water trawls, benthic macroinvertebra​tes using Ponar grabs, and zooplankton via depth-specific pumping) and physical (i.e., temperature and dissolved oxygen) data monthly during June through October 2005. Our results indicate that yellow perch avoid hypoxic bottom waters by either moving horizontally away from the hypoxic zone or migrating above the oxycline. We also found evidence to suggest that individuals that moved above the hypoxic hypolimnetic layer continue to ""dive"" into the hypoxic layer to feed on benthic invertebrates. Even so, during the height of hypoxia, both the amount and proportion of benthic macroinvertebra​tes consumed decreased, whereas consumption of zooplankton increased.

Similar to coastal and marine systems, the influence of hypoxia on pelagic organisms remains largely enigmatic in Lake Erie. During 2005, we used a plankton survey system (a sensor package consisting of an optical plankton counter, fluorometer, dissolved oxygen sensor, light sensor, and conductivity-​temperature-​depth sensor), coupled with a fish hydroacoustics system, to explore how the distribution of phytoplankton (chlorophyll), mesozooplankton​, and fish varied vertically and horizontally in relation to oxygen concentrations. To do so, we conducted surveys of the entire water column on a continuous basis during mild (August) and severe (September) hypoxia. Our surveys included two sampling designs: 1) basin-wide transects sampled during day and night to define broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap among pelagic organisms; and 2) shorter (5 km) transects sampled every 4 h over a 24-h period to explore how diel vertical migration and hypoxia interact to affect time-specific spatial overlap among fishes, mesozooplankton​, and phytoplankton. Our findings indicated that fish avoided regions of the hypolimnion with dissolved oxygen concentrations < 3 mg l− 1 by 1) moving horizontally into areas with higher oxygen or 2) moving vertically into the metalimnion, where a sharp thermocline and oxycline existed. A portion of the mesozooplankton continued to use the hypoxic hypolimnion as a refuge from fish predation during daytime at oxygen concentrations between 1 and 3 mg l− 1; however, there was usually a mesozooplankton maximum in the metalimnion, even when fish were compressed into this region. Prior to development of hypoxia, the metalimnion in some areas may have served as thermal refuge from predation from the epilimnetic planktivore, the emerald shiner, and the hypolimnetic planktivore-​benthivore, the rainbow smelt. Overall, the horizontal compression of fish into less-hypoxic regions in the deep area of the central basin followed by vertical compression into the metalimnion as hypoxia developed further may have led to local reduction of mesozooplankton prey in these regions.

Daphnia mendotae and the predatory cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus, both of which migrated from the metalimnion and epilimnion to the hypolimnion during the day under normoxic conditions, avoided the hypolimnion at DO levels ≤ 2.0 mg l− 1. Dissolved oxygen levels between 1.0 and 1.2 mg l− 1 were critical avoidance thresholds for most other mesozooplankton species, with the copepod Mesocyclops edax, a migrator between the epilimnion and hypolimnion, avoiding DO ≤ 1.2 mg l− 1.

As a result, the remaining intermittent streams and ditches, referred to as watercourses, may still provide habitat that is critical for native fish. Our objectives were to determine (1) fish presence, (2) the spatial gradients of fish distribution (including species identity, native versus nonnative status, and numbers), (3) fish use of the intermittent streams as spawning and nursery habitats, and (4) the main factors that influence the numbers of fish and fish species. In the winter and spring of 2002-2003, we examined the distributions of fish species in five sub-basins within the Willamette River valley. The sampling sites were in intermittent watercourses that drained grass seed-producing fields. We collected water samples and sampled fish from December to May with minnow traps and an electrofishing unit and collected data on the standard fish habitat variables at all sites in spring. Thirteen fish species were found and only three of them were exotic. The presence of recently hatched and juvenile fish shows that intermittent watercourses offer conditions suitable for spawning and juvenile rearing. The two watershed-scale variables with the most influence on fish species richness were the percentage of the watershed covered by forest and the distance to perennial water, the first of which had a direct relationship to species diversity and the second an inverse relationship. In turn, fish abundance had a negative, albeit modest, relationship with the distance to perennial water. Among local-scale variables, water velocity and conductivity were inversely related to species richness and fish numbers.

While these practices are presented here as voluntary guidelines, some local jurisdictions have tree protection regulations that must be followed. Conta​ct your local planning department for specific regulations for your area.","Ries, Paul;Godwin, Derek;Foster, Sarah;McNaughton, Micki;Cahill, Maria;Fitzgerald, Toni;Freed, James;Johns, Scott;Mead, Linden",ORESU-H-09-001,ORESU-H-09-001; EM 8994,A/ESG-07,"handbooks, manuals, guides",2009,Oregon Sea Grant,Tree Protection on Construction and Development Sites: A Best Management Practices Guidebook for the Pacific Northwest,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oregon State University Sea Grant Extension Service,NOAA Sea Grant

However, providing meaningful data products for undefined groups such as the general public is not straightforward​. In Oregon, several industry, science, and education organizations have formed a unique collaborative partnership to understand how to present and interpret water quality RTD to accomplish this goal. The project outlined here is the development of an interactive, computer-based exhibit, which interprets near-real time (NRT) data from Yaquina Bay as collected by a Land/Ocean Biogeochemical Observatory (LOBO), to facilitate the general public‟s understanding and analytical thinking about natural variability within an estuary and provide them with information that allows them to make more informed decisions about their environment. Housed as a permanent exhibit at the Hatfield Marine Science Center Visitors Center, a free-choice learning facility, a prototype exhibit module composed of several levels of increasing complexity was developed to interpret salinity patterns using an iterative, formative evaluation process of unobtrusive observations and interviews to guide exhibit modifications and to increase engagement by the audience. Two versions of the exhibit were evaluated and visitor use was measured in three ways: 1) where they visited within the exhibit; 2) how much time they spent at the exhibit; and 3) types of talking that occurred during the use of the exhibit. Findings reveal that visitors of all ages enjoy and understand the information presented in the exhibit, and that use of the exhibit and engagement in learning-​indicative behaviors differs between social group types. Visitor use also changed in the direction that we were hoping from the first version to the second version; however, visitors did not engage with the NRT dataset online, which was one of the main goals of the exhibit. Because of this, we conclude that, whereas the easier levels of the exhibit are appropriate as an interactive educational tool to support visitor understanding of NRT data, the expectation that visitors at a free-choice learning facility will interact with the actual dataset, which is central in the harder levels of the exhibit, may be unrealistic. Recommendations for ocean observing entities interested in developing educational products for an informal, general public audience are outlined.","Mikulak, Sarah E.",ORESU-Y-09-001,ORESU-Y-09-001,A/ESG-07,theses/disserta​tions,2009,Oregon Sea Grant,The development and evaluation of an interactive exhibit to support real-time water quality data interpretation by the public at an informal education setting,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In contrast to mammals and birds, these species are devoid of immunoglobulin A (IgA) or a functional equivalent. This observation suggests that specialization of immunoglobulin isotypes into mucosal and systemic responses took place during tetrapod evolution. Challenging that paradigm, here we show that IgT, an immunoglobulin isotype of unknown function, acts like a mucosal antibody. We detected responses of rainbow trout IgT to an intestinal parasite only in the gut, whereas IgM responses were confined to the serum. IgT coated most intestinal bacteria. As IgT and IgA are phylogeneticall​y distant immunoglobulins​, their specialization into mucosal responses probably occurred independently by a process of convergent evolution.","Zhang, Yong-an;Salinas, Irene;Li, Jun;Parra, David;Bjork, Sarsh;Xu, Zhen;LaPatra, Scott E.;Bartholomew, Jerri;Sunyer, J.

This parasite is endemic to the Pacific Northwest of North America and salmon and trout strains from endemic river basins show increased resistance to the parasite. It has been suggested that these resistant fish (i) exclude the parasite at the site of invasion and/or (ii) prevent establishment in the intestine. Using parasites pre-labeled with a fluorescent stain, carboxyfluoresc​ein succinimidyl diacetate (CFSE), the gills were identified as the site of attachment of C. shasta in a susceptible fish strain. In situ hybridization (ISH) of histological sections was then used to describe the invasion of the parasites in the gill filaments. To investigate differences in the progress of infection between resistant and susceptible fish, a C. shasta-​susceptible strain of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and a C. shasta-​resistant strain of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were sampled at consecutive time points following exposure at an endemic site. Using ISH in both species, the parasite was observed to migrate from the gill epithelium into the gill blood vessels where replication and release of parasite stages occurred. Quantitative PCR verified entry of the parasite into the blood. Parasite levels in blood increased 4 days p.i. and remained at a consistent level until the second week when parasite abundance increased further and coincided with host mortality. The timing of parasite replication and migration to the intestine were similar for both fish species. The field exposure dose was unexpectedly high and apparently overwhelmed the Chinook salmon's defenses, as no evidence of resistance to parasite penetration into the gills or prevention of parasite establishment in the intestine was observed.","Bjork, Sarah J.;Bartholomew, Jerri L.",ORESU-R-10-008,ORESU-R-10-008,R/RCF-24,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,Oregon Sea Grant,Invasion of Ceratomyxa shasta (Myxozoa) and comparison of migration to the intestine between susceptible and resistant fish hosts,NA,NA,"""International Journal for Parasitology,"" 40(9):1087-​1095, 2010.",NA,10.1016/j.ijpar​a.2010.03.005,NA,NA

For crabs of similar weight, both the crusher and cutter claws of C. maenas were larger and exhibited higher mechanical advantage values of the claw lever system than C. magister. The mechanical advantages of C. maenas crusher and cutter claws are 0.37 and 0.30 respectively versus 0.25 for the claws of C. magister. To evaluate the feeding rates of similar-size crabs of each species on prey varying in shell thickness, we conducted laboratory feeding trials. Each crab was offered thin-shelled mussels (Mytilus trossulus, 30-40 mm) or thicker shelled native oysters (Ostrea lurida, 40-50 mm), and the number of consumed prey items was recorded. When offered mussels, subadult C. magister ate significantly more prey per day (7.2 prey/day) than adult C. maenas (5.4 prey/day). However, when crabs were offered harder shelled native oysters, C. maenas, with their more robust claws, were more capable of crushing them than C. magister, with their more delicate claws.

Management actions targeted at removing these invaders and restoring native populations may have knock-on effects on non-target native species and ecosystems. For example, coastal dunes in the Pacific Northwest of North America are nearly monocultures of the introduced beachgrasses, Ammophila arenaria and Ammophila breviligulata. These invasive grasses have converted open, low-lying sand dunes with a sparse covering of native plants to tall, densely-​vegetated ridges dominated by the two invaders. As a result, the critical open-sand habitat of the federally threatened Western Snowy plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus) has declined along with populations of several native dune plant species. Here we investigate how nearly 20 years of management targeted at the removal of Ammophila for plover recovery are impacting native plant species and dune morphology along 500 km of coastline in Oregon and Washington, USA. Despite increased plovers and decreased Ammophila in treated areas, plover habitat restoration also has had the unintentional effect of reducing the richness and abundance of native dune plants. Additionally, frequent Ammophila removal has prevented the re-​establishment of the natural disturbance regime and dune function. Based on these findings, we suggest that the Pacific Northwest coastal dune ecosystem would benefit from a more synthetic community-wide management approach.","Zarnetske, Phoebe L.;Seabloom, Eric W.;Hacker, Sally D.",ORESU-R-10-010,ORESU-R-10-010,R/CNH-15;R/ECO-19,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,Oregon Sea Grant,"Non-target effects of invasive species management: beachgrass, birds, and bulldozers in coastal dunes",NA,NA,"""Ecosphere,"" 1(5):(Article 13) 1-20, November 2010.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Ceratomyxa shasta is endemic to the Pacific Northwestern United States and Canada, where epizootics are reported for both wild and hatchery reared fish. Identification of factors affecting the infectious cycle of C. shasta is complicated by its obligate two host lifecycle. The parasite infects the fish as an actinospore and develops into a myxospore in the fish host. The myxospore infects the freshwater polychaete, Manayunkia speciosa where the actinospore develops. A system for maintaining and infecting M. speciosa in the laboratory was developed and a series of laboratory studies tested the effects of temperature on polychaete survival, actinospore release and longevity. Temperature did not affect polychaete survival, but actinospore release occurred earlier and in greater abundance at the higher temperature, whereas actinospore longevity and temperature had an inverse relationship. A laboratory flow experiment tested the effects of two flow rates on M. speciosa survival, infection prevalence and fish infection. Polychaetes had higher survival at the fast flow with low infection prevalences compared to polychaetes held in the slow flow treatment. Susceptible rainbow trout became infected when exposed to just 1 actinospore per fish. Fatal infections in these fish were documented at 5 actinospores per fish. Infection prevalence and mean day to death increased with increasing actinospore dose. Fish size did not affect the infective dose; however, parasite dilution did have an effect. Actinospores were labeled with a fluorescent stain and C. shasta attachment to the gills was identified. In situ hybridization of histological sections was used to locate the parasite as it migrated from the gill epithelium, to proliferation in the blood vessel, and migration to the intestine. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify the abundance of the parasite in the blood. When the infection of susceptible and Resistant Chinook salmon were compared, there were no differences in actinospore penetration into the gills but resistant Chinook salmon did eliminate parasites in the blood after 2 weeks and isolate parasites in foci of inflammation in the intestine. Resistant Chinook salmon more effectively regulated an immune response to infection, effectively cleared the parasite showed evidence of recovery after infection. The research presented here has been fundamental in performing C. shasta infection studies in the laboratory in the fish and polychaete hosts. It has greatly affected our understanding of host parasite interactions including the infective dose for rainbow trout and the recognition of the gills and blood as early sites of C. shasta infection. It has also revealed differences in fish host response to infection including the characterizatio​n of a recovery from C. shasta infection.","Bjork, Sarah J.",ORESU-Y-10-002,ORESU-Y-10-002,R/RCF-24,theses/disserta​tions,2010,Oregon Sea Grant,Factors affecting the Ceratomyxa shasta infectious cycle and transmission between polychaete and salmonid hosts [electronic],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Oregon State University,NOAA Sea Grant

One hypothesis is that these dramatic declines in productivity may be related to increasing ocean acidity and the corresponding decrease in the saturation state of carbonate minerals which shellfish use to create their shells. The West Coast shellfish industry sought help from scientists to explore the causes of the shellfish losses, what role ocean acidification and other factors might be playing, and how to adapt to sustain West Coast shellfish resources. Addressing questions about ocean acidification requires integration of ocean observing measurements, laboratory exposure studies, shellfish recruitment and production data, and field studies of organism performance in relation to ocean conditions. However, these data are collected by different sectors that, to date, have had limited interaction. To stimulate collaborations among these sectors, and at the request of the shellfish farming and wild harvest communities, the Integrated Ocean Observing Systems, California Sea Grant, USC Sea Grant, Oregon Sea Grant, Washington Sea Grant, and California Ocean Science Trust convened a workshop. Fifty‐one participants were invited, including state and federal managers, industry representatives​, and leading academic researchers and oceanographers with expertise in larval recruitment, laboratory studies, and ocean chemistry. The workshop consisted of 8 plenary talks and three breakout sessions. The plenary presentations provided information summarizing OA research as related to impacts on the west coast shellfish industry including: monitoring programs, laboratory exposure studies, and industry observations. In the first breakout session, participants separated into three groups to outline existing and ongoing data sets, as well as what is needed to answer questions on OA impacts on the West Coast in three areas: oceanographic data, recruitment data, and exposure study data. In the second breakout session participants discussed how existing data sets can be better integrated to clarify impacts of OA and discuss what is needed for future studies both in the near‐shor​e and open‐ocea​n.

Mangroves now occupy 1500km2 on the island of O'ahu. The success of R. mangle on O'ahu has begun to create problems for local wildlife, and has led to mangroves being removed around the coast. Typical removal practices include cutting down of the above-sediment tree, but leaving the fibrous root mat in place, which is rich in tannins and potentially toxic to a number of benthic organisms. Little data is available concerning benthic ecosystem functioning in Hawaii's mangroves forests, and to the best of our knowledge no data exists on the effects of the removal strategy employed in Hawaii on benthic ecosystem recovery. We used isotopic tracer experiments to analyze benthic ecosystem functioning in sediments from 5 sites: an invasive mangrove forest, where mangroves were removed 2 and 6 years ago, and mangrove-free control sites along the coastline of O'ahu. The study showed that the invasion of R. mangle has led to a major ecosystem shift with C-cycling in mangrove sediments being channelled almost exclusively though bacteria in contrast to mangrove-​removal and control environments, where macrofauna are the most important agents for C-cycling. Although the study highlighted that the relative importance of macrofauna and bacteria to C-cycling had recovered 6 yr after mangrove removal, foodweb structure and rates of C-turnover by both macrofauna and bacteria had not recovered to conditions characteristic of un-invaded sand-flats, emphasizing that the current mangrove removal strategy hinders benthic ecosystem recovery for many years after removal as a result of the continued impacts from the remaining root-fibre biomass.","Sweetman, A.

Decision makers require data to integrate new uses (wave energy) with existing uses (commercial/rec​reational).

Yet, permitting processes rarely fail on technical or natural science grounds; rather, they fail because of lack of attention to the human dimension. Legislators and resource managers need to understand socioeconomic and sociopolitical perceptions. This knowledge is crucial for allowing citizens to determine their interests and civic opportunities. An informed and engaged public is essential to progress on environmental protection and sustainable development. It is important to assess the scope and depth of policy-relevant knowledge among stakeholders and the public, to learn where they acquire their information, and to flesh out the link between policy-relevant knowledge and understanding/a​cceptance of wave energy generation.

The geological setting and geochemical nature of deep-sea vents that impact the biogeography of vent organisms, chemosynthesis, and the known biological and metabolic diversity of Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea, including the handful of natural products isolated to date from deep-sea vent organisms, are considered here in an assessment of deep-sea hydrothermal vents as potential hot spots for natural products investigations. Of critical importance too are the logistics of collecting deep vent organisms, opportunities for re-collection considering the stability and longevity of vent sites, and the ability to culture natural product-​producing deep vent organisms in the laboratory. New cost-effective technologies in deep-sea research and more advanced molecular techniques aimed at screening a more inclusive genetic assembly are poised to accelerate natural product discoveries from these microbial diversity hot spots.","Thornburg, Christopher C.;Zabriskie, T.

When joined with ethnohistoric records, archaeology provides an alternative conceptual view of the potential for sustainable harvests and can suggest possible social mechanisms for managing human behavior. Review of the ~7,500-​year-​long fish bone record from two subregions of the Pacific Northwest shows remarkable stability in salmon use. As major changes in the ecological and social system occurred over this lengthy period, persistence in the fishery is not due simply to a lack of perturbation, but rather indicates resilience in the ecological-​human system. Of several factors possibly contributing to resilience, low human population size and harvesting pressure, habitat enhancement, and suppression of competing predators do not appear to be of major importance. Flexible resource use, including human use of a range of local resources, many of which are linked in a food web with salmon, likely contributed to resilience. Most important were the beliefs and social institutions (including ownership, regulation, rituals, and monitoring) that placed restraints on salmon use as a common pool resource. In contrast, only a small fraction of our modern society relies economically on or has direct interaction with the fish, which limits our concern and willingness to fundamentally change behaviors that contribute to habitat degradation and loss, the main challenges facing salmon populations today. Salmon recovery efforts may benefit substantially from investing more resources into establishing links between community groups and actual fish populations, which would create a sense of proprietorship, one of the keys to resilience in the indigenous salmon fishery.","Campbell, Sarah K.;Butler, Virginia L.",ORESU-R-10-017,ORESU-R-10-017,M/A-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,Oregon Sea Grant,"Archaeological evidence for resilience of Pacific Northwest salmon populations and the socioecological system over the last ~7,500 years",NA,NA,"""Ecology and Society,"" 15(1), 2010.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Preservation of pristine salmon rivers has thus been advocated as a cost-effective way of sustaining wild Pacific salmon populations. We examine the value of freshwater habitat protection in conserving salmon and fostering resilience in the Kitlope watershed in northern coastal British Columbia-a large (3186 km2) and undeveloped temperate rainforest ecosystem with legislated protected status. In comparison with other pristine Pacific Rim salmon rivers we studied, the Kitlope is characterized by abundant and complex habitats for salmon that should contribute to high resilience. However, biological productivity in this system is constrained by naturally cold, light limited, ultra-​oligotrophic growing conditions; and the mean (+/- SD) density of river-rearing salmonids is currently low (0.32 +/- 0.27 fish per square meter; n = 36) compared to our other four study rivers (grand mean = 2.55 +/- 2.98 fish per square meter; n = 224). Existing data and traditional ecological knowledge suggest that current returns of adult salmon to the Kitlope, particularly sockeye, are declining or depressed relative to historic levels. This poor stock status-​presumably owing to unfavorable conditions in the marine environment and ongoing harvest in coastal mixed-stock fisheries-​reduces the salmon-mediated transfer of marine-derived nutrients and energy to the system's nutrient-poor aquatic and terrestrial food webs. In fact, Kitlope Lake sediments and riparian tree leaves had marine nitrogen signatures (d15N) among the lowest recorded in a salmon ecosystem. The protection of the Kitlope watershed is undoubtedly a conservation success story. However, ""salmon strongholds"" of pristine watersheds may not adequately sustain salmon populations and foster social and ecological resilience without more holistic and risk-averse management that accounts for uncertainty and interactions between ecosystem fertility, harvest, climate dynamics, and food web dynamics in the marine and freshwater environments encompassed by the life cycle of the fish.","Hill, Aaron C.;Bansak, Thomas S.;Ellis, Bonnie K.;Stanford, Jack A.",ORESU-R-10-018,ORESU-R-10-018,M/A-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,Oregon Sea Grant,Merits and limits of ecosystem protection for conserving wild salmon in a northern coastal British Columbia river,NA,NA,"""Ecology and Society,"" 15(2), published online, 2010.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Like many coastal towns in Oregon, Port Orford's main economy is the commercial fishing industry. As such, the community has a high dependence on its nearshore marine resources. Those who make their living from these resources know that successful management is vital to maintain the fisheries and the economy that they depend on. The market for live fish in Port Orford has increased rapidly over the past two decades. To ensure that these stocks have resilience to market pressures, the Port Orford Ocean Resource Team, a local non-profit organization, has actively promoted collaborative research and monitoring of local stocks. I worked with local fishermen to design and conduct a tagging and observational study to learn more about movement of rockfish in the Port Orford area and to try to evaluate the effectiveness of a local, voluntary conservation measure to release gravid females. The overall goal of this project was to evaluate the possibilities and limitations of collaborative research and fish stock monitoring in fishing communities like Port Orford. From late spring of 2008 through winter 2010, 1080 fish of 11 species were tagged with external plastic tags and released by scientists, fishermen and NOAA observers on regular commercial fishing trips. Although tag returns have been sparse (1.39% overall), the results of our tagging study provide some initial clues on movement rates of rockfishes in the Port Orford nearshore reef system. This provides pilot data for development of future studies and may inform management decisions regarding the rockfish in and around a site that will soon be designated as a marine reserve. Underwater observation of 4 released rockfish suggests that ""venting"" - release of expanded air in the swim bladder with a hypodermic needle - may be a successful tool for getting released fish back into protective habitat. Overall, I found that collaborative research is complex and time consuming, and that involvement by both fishermen and scientists was essential for the project. I found that local fishermen were enthusiastic about the project and several participated in the tagging effort; but their assistance was often limited due to poor weather conditions, permit issues, and the need to make money by fishing rather than doing research. Each group contributed significantly to the successes of the project by offering their own expertise and resources. Fishermen offered a tremendous amount of local knowledge, logistics and practicalities of research on fishing vessels, and their valuable time for chartering and collection. Scientists offered experimental design, data collection, and data analysis. There are no ""one size fits all"" solutions for solving the inherent issues of working with many different groups with many different backgrounds. The principal success of this project was creating the opportunity for more local, collaborative fisheries research in the future. This project may perhaps encourage research led by the fishermen themselves. It emphasized the importance of effective communication and the significance of bringing both local knowledge and scientific knowledge to the table. It is my hope that lessons learned from this, and other projects that bring together a diversity of stakeholders for the common goal of better management, could help actualize these opportunities.","Stoike, Suzanna Lynn",ORESU-Y-10-005,ORESU-Y-10-005,R/RCF-26,theses/disserta​tions,2010,Oregon Sea Grant,Collaborative research in the Port Orford live fish fishery: lessons learned,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The new methodology developed in this project of utilizing community members as researchers was done in an attempt to: 1) produce this type of information in a timelier manner and 2) to get to sensitive information that some community members are reticent to share with academics. Project team members collected ethnographic data, with the community members conducting the bulk of the interviews. This was a success in that community members helped to distribute the work allowing the interview phase to be completed more quickly. It also was a success in helping us to access both the informants and the sensitive information. Lastly, it was a success in that the project produced long-form profiles which include a depth of information that was previously unavailable. However the new, long-form profiles still face the challenge of getting decision makers to use this product. Why? Because fisheries managers and policy makers are already overwhelmed with a large amount of information. There is also a lack of understanding and general confusion over how to use social science information in management decisions. This paper will discuss the community profiles and the information they contain as well as discuss possible ways to transform the profiles into products more easily used by decision makers.","Package, C.

The last frontier - the ocean - is being expropriated. While the potential of economic gain through job creation and or access to clean renewable energy is enticing for coastal communities, there is also a deep fear that wave energy development is essentially replacing one ""renewable"" industry - fishing / seafood - with another. The space desired for renewable energy generation - flat, sandy bottom - is often some of the most productive crabbing grounds. Therefore, this new industry has become just one more competitor for an already-​stressed fishing industry. In addition, wave energy generation is a relatively new industry in the US and the world. The processes for permitting have been unclear and complicated. The processes for community involvement are being designed and implemented on the fly. Add to this the fact that political leaders are striving to make Oregon ""the leader"" in wave energy development and a process that is moving at an accelerated pace. Coastal communities of place, and communities of interest like commercial and recreational fishing, need to successfully engage in this issue. Thoughtfully-​designed, educational outreach and engagement is vital to raise awareness and to encourage involvement. This paper describes challenges and successes in engaging these stakeholders, and the progress toward developing systems for working together and making sure that diverse perspectives and needs are heard.

Coastal dunes protect lives, infrastructure, and ecosystems particularly during severe winter storms with associated storm surges, large wave heights, and wave runup. Before the 1900's, the native plant Elymus mollis was the dominant dune grass in the PNW and dune geomorphology was largely determined by sediment supply and other physical factors with the backshore generally consisting of small hillocks and open sand (Cooper, 1958). The introduction of invasive beach grasses in the 1920's resulted in significant changes to dune geomorphology (Cooper, 1958; Seabloom and Wiedemann, 1994), particularly with the formation of relatively stable foredunes. Preliminary work suggests that the invasive grass Ammophila arenaria (European beach grass)is associated with taller, narrower foredunes while a second invader Ammophila breviligulata (American beach grass) is associated with shorter, broader foredunes. We hypothesize an ecological control on coastal vulnerability in that the taller dunes are more resistant to overtopping and flooding but possibly more susceptible to erosion while the shorter dunes may withstand erosion events but are more vulnerable to flooding. As part of a larger collaborative effort to determine the relative importance of physical and ecological mechanisms in controlling dune geomorphology, this study examines alongshore varying dune features such as dune crest height, dune toe height, and backshore slope from lidar elevation data along the PNW coast. These data are spatially compared with short- and long-term shoreline change rates and where available sediment grain size data to determine if statistically significant correlations exist. The data is also combined with the results of co-located vegetation surveys to confirm the preliminary relationships between plant species and dune geomorphology. If the different grass species do indeed have an order one affect on dune geomorphology, it is important to quantitatively understand how potential management strategies for the different species might impact coastal vulnerability. We run a series of dune erosion models for various PNW littoral cells with distinctly different dune heights and beach slopes. The models include a geometric model, an equilibrium profile model, and a (wave tank) calibrated wave impact model. The simulations are run with extreme storm condition scenarios to estimate event-scale dune erosion under varying ecological and geomorphologica​l regimes. We also examine event-​scaleflooding scenarios via a simple TWL model to again test our hypothesis regarding ecological controls on coastal vulnerability.","Mull, J.",ORESU-WR-10-013,ORESU-WR-10-013,R/CNH-15,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2010,Oregon Sea Grant,Coastal vulnerability to erosion and flooding along dune-backed beaches in the U.S. Pacific Northwest,NA,NA,"""2010 Ocean Sciences Meeting,"" Portland, Oregon, February 22-26, 2010.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Touch tanks containing marine and aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates are a ubiquitous and popular feature of public, informal science venues like aquariums, zoos and science centers (Ross, Norman, & Dorsch, 2003). This paper frames touch tanks as settings for moving children and adults from being everyday observers to scientific observers, examining activities and discourse emergent in family interaction that might be leveraged in helping move visitors from novice to expert observation. Theoretical framework. We approach interactions with touch tanks as mediated action (Wertsch, 1998; Wertsch, del Rio, & Alvarez, 1995). From this point of view, with its roots in activity theory (Vygotsky, 1987; Leontev, 1978; Wertsch, 1988), learning occurs through interactions mediated by physical and psychological tools (including live animals) and symbols (most often language). A mediated action framework encourages us to see science learning as engagement in socially shared practices mediated by the language and interactional routines used by docents, printed materials, and visitors. Here we report family practices associated with observation using Eberbach and Crowleys (2009) framework for categorizing observation to document the roles of noticing, expectations, observation records, and productive dispositions in shaping family interactions and characterizing their learning. Methods and data sources. Participants (n=40 groups) were video- and audio-taped at touch tanks at four sites on the US west coast. Video collection was equally distributed among the four study sites. Field notes were recorded by hand during the videotaping, and a fifteen-minute exit interview was audio recorded. Results. Evidence from both observations and interviews suggests that participants consistently engage in practices of everyday observations and that docents and staff occasionally model or introduce transitional or even more scientific observation practices. There is, however, very little evidence for purposeful scaffolding of visitors interactions toward scientific observation. We also present evidence that the touch tanks are excellent sites for leveraging visitors naming routines, productive dispositions, and expectations to help move toward more scientific observation practices. Significance. This study addresses a gap in knowledge about the learning made possible by touch tanks used by public aquariums of almost every size. Examining family interaction and learning and how everyday practices might be used as springboards to scientific practices gives us basic insights into how everyday observational practices might be leveraged for science learning in a wide variety of settings.","Rowe, Shawn M.;Kisiel, James F.",ORESU-WR-10-018,ORESU-WR-10-018,A/ESG-07,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2010,Oregon Sea Grant,Touch tanks as settings for families to engage in scientific observation (abstract only),NA,NA,"""Understanding Complex Ecologies in a Changing World, 2010 AERA Annual Meeting,"" Denver, Colorado, April 30-May 4, 2010.",NA,NA,NA,NA

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/6319515_3730_2816744.csv,125,"Tidal marshlands in the upper estuary ecotone provide essential habitat for juvenile salmonids. In this environment, salmonids grow rapidly and acclimate to saltwater. Worldwide, tidal marshes have been diked and drained to provide agricultural and residential land. Tide gates are one-way doors integrated into dike systems that prevent saltwater flooding and allow upland drainage to the estuary during low tide. By preventing tidal exchange, tide gates have significant upstream effects on water temperature and chemistry, plant and animal community structure, and geomorphology. Since they are closed most of the day and may be difficult to pass when open, tide gates may act as fish passage barriers for juvenile salmonids. They may also affect juvenile salmon migration timing by altering environmental variables that influence emigration rate in upstream habitats. We conducted our research in Coos Bay, one of the many Oregon estuaries with extensive use of tide gates. We studied three streams, one with a top-hinged tide gate, one with a side-hinged gate, and one without any tide gates that acted as our reference site. Our study species was coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, which may encounter tide gates both in the subyearling and smolt life stages in our study streams. Our objectives were to: 1) quantify upstream and downstream fish passage occurrence at all three sites, 2) determine whether juvenile coho salmon passage is associated with a specific range of gate conditions, and 3) identify any associations between coho smolt emigration rate and environmental variables that are influenced by tide gates. We installed stationary passive integrated transponder (PIT) antennae around both tide gates and a tidal channel in the non-gated stream to record the movement of PIT tagged juvenile coho salmon. Coho salmon smolts passed upstream most frequently at the non-gated channel (48% of all smolts detected at the array), next the side-hinged gate (28%), and lastly, the top-hinged gate (3%). Juvenile coho salmon passed more frequently at a specific range of gate angles and tailwater depths at both top hinged and side-hinged tide gates. Smolts passed downstream more frequently at greater gate angles and tailwater depths than available on average at both tide gates. Subyearlings passed upstream more frequently during small gate angles and a narrow range of tailwater depths at the top-hinged gate but did not pass more frequently under a particular range of conditions at the side-hinged gate. At the top-hinged gate, conditions favorable for subyearling upstream passage occurred towards the end of the gate open period and therefore subyearlings were severely limited in their opportunities for passage. At multiple sites, emigration rate was associated with environmental variables that may be altered by tide gates. Increases in water temperature were associated with an increasing likelihood of smolt emigration at multiple sites. At a tide gate that allowed upstream estuarine influence, increasing salinity was associated with a decreasing likelihood of emigration. Our results suggest that tide gates may interfere with salmonid movement and migration by creating physical barriers to fish passage and potentially influencing migratory timing by altering environmental variables. When installing or retrofitting tide gates, these factors should be taken into consideration since a tide gate's design may determine the severity of its effects on salmonids. Our work should be considered a case study and the findings should not be assumed to be transferable due to the great diversity of tide gate installations in use. We recommend further research, including a more in depth analysis of the effects of tide gates on subyearling coho salmon and an investigation of piscivorous predator exploitation of tide gates.","Bass, Arthur",ORESU-Y-10-008,ORESU-Y-10-008,A/ESG-07,theses/disserta​tions,2010,Oregon Sea Grant,Juvenile coho salmon movement and migration through tide gates,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It focuses on improving the efficiency of parentage assignment, determining the optimum life stage to mix oyster families for rearing and selection, comparing mixed-family and separate-family selective breeding in the field, and applying the mixed method to estimate the heritability of shell shape. We developed novel computer software, P-LOCI (available at http://marinere​search.oregonst​ate.edu/genetic​s/PLOCI.html), which identifies the most efficient set of codominant markers for assigning parentage, accounting for marker linkage, mating design, null alleles and genotyping error, and found that the most efficient group of loci for assignment is not necessarily comprised of the top individually ranked loci, or best for all populations. We determined the optimum time to mix oyster families for rearing and selection in the field; overall, planting size is the most prudent time to mix families for MFS, due to high variability in family representation produced during larval and nursery stages. Mixing families at stages earlier than this for selection on field traits would require pre-planting genotyping of large samples for estimation of initial family representation, which would add substantial cost, or other special considerations. Rearing mixed family groups of oysters in the field yielded very similar results to rearing the same families separately, (r = 0.817 for two-site average individual weight at harvest), demonstrating it is unlikely associative effects are of great importance in the Pacific oyster. Our results show that the mixed method was well-suited for individual traits and walk-back selection, but would incur higher costs than the separate method to estimate survival with lower precision. Finally, we utilized the mixed method to estimate the heritability of shell shape using midparent-​offspring regression; we estimated shell depth heritability as 0.404 +/- 0.14 and shell width as 0.287 +/- 0.11, nearly equal to the only other study for the Pacific oyster, demonstrating potential for selective breeding on these traits in this U.S. population, and similar results between methods. Overall, we found that mixed-family rearing is viable for Pacific oyster breeding, given some important restrictions.","Matson, Sean E.",ORESU-Y-10-010,ORESU-Y-10-010,R/SAQ-10,theses/disserta​tions,2010,Oregon Sea Grant,"Development, evaluation and application of a mixed-family selective breeding method for the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The first manuscript examined tsunami force and pressure distributions on a rigid wall that was fronted by a small seawall. Six different seawall heights were examined, two of which were exposed to a range of solitary wave heights. The same experiment was done without a seawall for comparison. The measured wave profile contained incident offshore, incident broken, reflected broken, and transmitted wave heights measured using wire resistance and ultrasonic wave gauges. Results showed that small individual seawalls increased reflection of the incoming broken bore front and reduced force on the rigid landward wall. These findings agreed well with published field reconnaissance on small seawalls in Thailand that showed a correlation between seawalls and reduced damage on landward structures. The second manuscript examined cross-shore variation of tsunami loading as the loading scenario changed from an impulse to a quasi-steady bore. In this study tsunami force and pressure distributions on a rigid wall were determined experimentally in a large scale wave flume, and forces were examined experimentally at three different cross-shore locations. Incident offshore and incident broken wave heights measured using wire resistance and ultrasonic wave gages, and velocity was measured using acoustic-​Doppler velocimeters. Force and pressure profiles were measured using load cells and pressure transducers. At each cross-shore location, the force and pressure profiles showed an impulse peak followed by a period of sustained force. This type of profile was seen for each wave height tested, and as expected as wave height increased the value of the maximum impulse force also increased. By examining force time histories, it was also found that while the hydrostatic pressure distribution accurately depicted the force profile during the period of sustained force it was significantly less reliable during the impact period. It was found that as the rigid wall was moved further offshore the peaks were less pronounced and the corresponding maximum impulse force values decreased. Thus, as the wall was moved onshore the loading scenario transitioned from impact to a quasi-steady bore-like loading condition. The sustained forces measured experimentally verified the empirical formula for steady state force presented by Iizuka and Matsutomi (2000). This theoretical formula was also presented by both the FEMA Coastal Construction Manual (2000) and the City of Honolulu Building Code (2003) as the ""hydrodynamic force.""","Oshnack, Mary Elizabeth",ORESU-Y-10-011,ORESU-Y-10-011,R/CNH-11,theses/disserta​tions,2010,Oregon Sea Grant,Analysis of wave forces on prototype walls under tsunami loading,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW), coastal foredune geomorphology is determined by both physical and ecological mechanisms. Before the 1900's, the native plant Elymus mollis was the dominant dune grass and dune morphology was largely determined by sediment supply and other physical factors. The introduction of two different invasive beach grasses in the first half of the 20th century resulted in significant changes to PNW foredune geomorphology. Recent work has shown that the invasive beach grass Ammophila arenaria is associated with taller, narrower foredunes while the grass Ammophila breviligulata is associated with shorter, broader foredunes. We hypothesize that this may impact coastal vulnerability as the taller, narrower foredunes may be more resistant to overtopping, but less resistant to erosion, while the shorter, broader foredunes may be more resistant to erosion, but less resistant to overtopping. The work presented in this thesis is part of a larger, interdisciplina​ry effort to determine the relative importance of physical and ecological mechanisms in controlling coastal foredune geomorphology and vulnerability in the PNW. Airborne topographic lidar data is used to characterize the regional variability in foredune geomorphology within several littoral cells, subcells, and beaches of the PNW. We present and discuss techniques to automatically and accurately extract foredune morphometric parameters from a lidar elevation data set of the coasts of Oregon and Washington. If the different grass species do affect foredune geomorphology, it is important to understand how managing them might impact coastal vulnerability. Therefore, we use the geomorphologica​l parameters and measured hydrodynamic parameters during a major winter storm to estimate vulnerability to overtopping and erosion at beaches with distinctly different foredunes. Estimates of overtopping and erosion are normalized by the foredune heights and widths to elucidate how the different foredune types, and possibly the associated beach grasses, affect vulnerability. A series of simple foredune erosion models including a geometric model, an equilibrium profile model, and a wave impact model are evaluated for applicability to the PNW coast.","Mull, Jeremy M.",ORESU-Y-10-012,ORESU-Y-10-012,R/CNH-15,theses/disserta​tions,2010,Oregon Sea Grant,Coastal sand dunes in the U.S. Pacific Northwest: regional variability in foredune geomorphology and associated physical vulnerability to hazards,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By studying a simple geometric structure such as a cylinder under a simple transient waveform, fundamental mechanisms of wake development under solitary wave flow can be explored using this method of flow visualization. In order to quantify these wake formations, laboratory experiments were performed using a particle image velocimetery (PIV) system to extract velocity vector field data in the three planes of motion in the cylinder wake. Based on observations made from these images, the interaction of a cylinder with a solitary wave was categorized into three phases: 1) formation of a shear layer and generation of primary vortices, 2) generation of secondary vortices and shedding of primary vortices, and 3) migration of vortices outward and upstream of the cylinder. A second visualization technique developed by Zhang et al. (2008) and Palke et al. (unpublished) based on asymmetric tensor analysis is applied to the velocity data to determine non?translation​al components (volumetric dilation, angular deformation and rotation) of the cylinder wake. This technique provides a means of visualizing and quantifying the velocity gradient tensor components of scaling, stretching, and rotation in the fluid. These images provide valuable insight into the development and dissipation of vorticity in the cylinder wake. In particular, they suggest fluid elongation perpendicular to areas of intense rotation contributing to vortex dissipation outward and in the upstream direction of the cylinder.","Seiffert, Betsy Rose",ORESU-Y-10-013,ORESU-Y-10-013,R/CNH-20,theses/disserta​tions,2010,Oregon Sea Grant,Flow visualization for wake formation under solitary wave flow,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the concentrations of caffeine reported from aquatic systems are low (ng/L to μg/L), harmful ecological effects not detected by traditional toxicity tests could occur as a result of caffeine contamination. The goals of this thesis project were to: 1) quantify concentrations of caffeine occurring in the coastal ocean off of the Oregon Coast and to determine if higher levels were correlated with proximity to caffeine pollution sources; and 2) investigate the sub-lethal cellular toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of caffeine on Mytilus californianus, an intertidal mussel that is one of the dominant species of the Oregon Coast. Caffeine was analyzed at 14 locations in the coastal ocean off of the Oregon Coast. Sampling locations were stratified between populated areas identified as having sources of caffeine pollution and sites located in sparsely populated areas not in proximity to major caffeine pollution sources. Caffeine concentrations were also measured in the major water body discharging near sampling locations. Caffeine was detected in water from the coastal ocean off of the Oregon Coast at concentrations ranging from below the reporting limit to 44.7 ng/L. The occurrence and concentrations of caffeine in the coastal ocean did not correspond well with pollution threats from population density and point and non-point sources, but did correspond with a storm event occurrence. Caffeine concentrations in rivers and estuaries draining to the coast ranged from below the reporting limit to 152.2 ng/L. Hsp70, a molecular biomarker of cellular stress, was used to investigate the sub-lethal toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of caffeine to the mussel M. californianus. Hsp70 concentrations in the gill and mantle tissue of mussels exposed to 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 μg/L of caffeine for 10, 20, and 30 days were compared to basal levels in control mussels. Hsp70 in the gill tissue of M. californianus had an initial attenuation of the iii stress protein followed by a significant albeit moderate up-regulation relative to controls in all but the 0.5 μg/L treatment. Hsp70 in the mantle tissue of mussels exposed to caffeine did not differ from control mussels.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/6319739_127_2813141.csv,58,"Earth's changing climate is expected to have significant physical impacts along the coast and estuarine shorelands of Oregon, ranging from increased erosion and inundation of low lying areas, to wetland loss and increased estuarine salinity. The environmental changes associated with climate change include rising sea levels, increased occurrences of severe storms, rising air and water temperatures, and ocean acidification. The combination of these processes and their climate controls are important to beach and property erosion, flood probabilities, and estuarine water quality, with the expectation of significant changes projected for the 21st century. Coastal change and flood hazards along the Oregon coast are caused by a number of ocean processes, each of which has significant climate controls such that the severity and frequency of the hazards in the future can be expected to increase. There is near certainty that the rate of sea-level rise will increase in the future as a result of global warming, with the potential of greater than a 1.0 meter increase in sea level by 2100. Evaluating the consequences of intensified and more frequent hazards is complicated by Oregon's tectonic setting, with there being significantly different rates of land uplift along the coast. Taken together, the variable rate of uplift plus the present-day rate of sea level rise, some stretches of the coast are submerging as the sea level rise is greater than the tectonic uplift, whereas other areas are emerging where the reverse is true. The prospects are that with accelerated rates of sea level rise, the entire coast will eventually be submerging and experience significantly greater erosion and flood impacts than at present day. Another long-term trend is increasing storm intensities and the heights of the waves they generate. In addition, the periodic occurrence of major El Ninos in the future will compound the impacts of increasing sea levels and waves, resulting in severe episodes of coastal erosion and flooding, as experienced during the El Ni�o winters of 1982-83 and 1997-98. At present it is not known whether or not El Ni�o intensity and frequency will increase under a changing climate. With these multiple processes and their climate controls having important roles in causing erosion and flooding along the Oregon coast, it is challenging to collectively analyze them with the goal of providing meaningful assessments of future coastal hazards during the next several decades. 1 Department of Geosciences, Oregon State University 2 Pacific Coastal Ecology Branch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 3 College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences, Oregon State University 4 Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries 5 Western Fisheries Research Center, Biological Resources Discipline, U.S. Geological Survey 6 South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve 7 Oregon Sea Grant 8 US Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District Coastal infrastructure will come under increased risk to damage and inundation under a changing climate with impacted sectors including transportation and navigation, coastal engineering structures (seawalls, riprap, jetties etc.) and flood control and prevention structures, water supply and waste/storm water systems, and recreation, travel and hospitality. It is likely that regional coastal climate change will result in changes in the intensity and timing of coastal upwelling, shifts in temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations, and alteration of the carbonate chemistry (ocean acidification) of nearshore waters. The combination of these meteorological and nearshore ocean changes will exert stress on the communities of near-coastal and estuarine organisms. The range of community responses to the climate change stressors may include elevational shifts in the distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation, disruption of shell formation for calcifying organisms, alteration of the phenology of phytoplankton blooms, shoreward migration of tidal marshes, and increased colonization by non-indigenous aquatic species. Unfortunately, significant knowledge gaps remain, impairing our ability to accurately assess the impacts of climate change along our coast and estuarine shorelands. For example, the uncertainty of future global sea level rise is significant with credible projections ranging from less than 0.5 m to as much as 2.0 m by 2100. At present we do not conclusively understand the climate controls on increasing storm intensities and wave heights and therefore have a very limited ability to project future trends in coastal storm impacts. The magnitude and frequency of major El Ni�os has significant implications for the state of Oregon; however, at this time we are unable to assess whether or not these will increase in the future due to climate change. Further, the long-term time-series data necessary to definitively identify perturbations of estuarine communities that can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change are lacking and therefore our understanding of anticipated shifts remain largely speculative.","Ruggiero, Peter;Brown, Cheryl A.;Komar, Paul D.;Allan, Jonathan C.;Reusser, Deborah A.;Lee, Henry II",ORESU-R-10-021,ORESU-R-10-021,R/CNH-14-PD,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,Oregon Sea Grant,Impacts of climate change on Oregon's coasts and estuaries,NA,NA,"""Oregon Climate Change Assessment Report (Ocar) Legislative Summary,"" Chapter 6, pp. 211-268, 2010.",NA,NA,NA,NA
/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/6319793_6_2813020.csv,21,"To date very little research has been conducted explicitly with Oregon citizens regarding their understanding or attitudes about climate change. In this chapter we discuss results of four recent studies (all completed within the last 18 months) in the context of a behavioral change model that suggests that while individuals and groups need to know something about climate change to make appropriate behavioral changes?to either mitigate greenhouse gas emissions or adapt to changing climate?they also need to believe changing their behavior is important and worthwhile, and any barriers to behavioral change must be identified and addressed. Two of the studies examine how different groups (private and public sector professionals along the Oregon coast and County Health Department professionals) understand climate change and how it affects their professional responsibilitie​s and obligations. In general, the studies find a widespread acceptance of changing climate, although rural County Health professionals are less likely than urban professionals to accept climate change. And, in both contexts all respondents believe they have the capacity and expertise to address the most pressing impacts of climate change if barriers are removed including funding, policy changes, and management support. The other two studies surveyed members of the general public to characterize attitudes toward climate change, finding that many respondents identified climate change as an important issue facing individuals, organizations, and government agencies. The national American Values Survey also suggests a substantial portion of the population (36% nationally) is currently involved in activities directed at mitigating or adapting to climate change. While Oregonians participated in this national survey, we are unable to isolate the Oregon responses; however, a follow-up focus group was conducted in Oregon to validate the national responses. We should use the results of this survey carefully, although it does support findings of research focused only on Oregonians. These initial and small-scale studies suggest that Oregonians know something about climate change and many are likely to perceive it as a problem although they may not know all the scientific details. There are cognitive and perceptual barriers needing to be addressed if we expect individuals or groups to change behaviors for either mitigating or adapting to climate 1 Department of Sociology, Water Resources Policy and Management, Oregon State University 2 Oregon Sea Grant, Oregon State University 3 Climate Leadership Initiative, University of Oregon 4 Epidemiologist, Oregon Public Health Division, Department of Human Services 5 Masters in Public Policy Program, Oregon State University 6 Climate Leadership Initiative, University of Oregon 7 Department of Political Science, Masters in Public Policy, Oregon State University 8 Climate Leadership Initiative, University of Oregon change, although there appears to be general acceptance of, and desire for, government policies to direct such behavioral change. Recent projects conducted by the Climate Leadership Initiative (CLI) examined the impacts of climate change on cultural and tribal resources, and the built environment more generally. While a lack of understanding and awareness persists about Oregon tribes' vulnerability and capacity to adapt to current and projected climate change, dependency on natural resources, confinement to small portions of reservation land, and existing stressors will likely increase their vulnerability to climate change impacts (CLI and NCCSP 2010). Projected climate changes in precipitation rates and temperatures are likely to threaten the integrity of the built environment, including buildings, roads, highways and railroads, water and sewage systems, and energy facilities throughout Oregon (CLI 2008, 2010). Direct costs will result from flood events and anticipated increases in wildfire intensity and frequency due to climate change, while indirect costs are likely to be many times larger and will result from more rapid depreciation of property from higher temperatures, more intense storms and other climate stressors (CLI and NCCSP 2008). The full extent of impacts on cultural and built environments remains to be assessed in Oregon. Finally, climate change is likely to have an impact on public health issues in Oregon including the spread of communicable diseases as well as an increase in water-, food-, and air-borne infections. Predicted average increases in summer temperatures will make heat waves a greater likelihood, causing heat-related morbidity and mortality, especially among vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, low income populations, pregnant women and those who work in outdoor occupations. Indeed, an increase in injuries and cases of carbon monoxide poisoning (from using gas-powered generators) has been reported as a result of the recent winter storms and subsequent flooding in Oregon. Increasing temperatures in Oregon could raise the threat of vector-borne diseases and emerging infections. Respiratory insults, especially among persons with pre-existing lung health problems would be exacerbated by exposure to smoke from forest fires, as well as from the projected increases in air pollution levels in our region. Air pollution and increases in pollen counts (and a prolonged pollen producing season) may increase cases of allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions among susceptible populations. Additional research is needed to set baselines in order to monitor changes over time to understand more fully: (1) how a wide range of Oregonians who are likely to be affected by climate change due to the place they live, the job they hold, or the organization they work for, experience climate change impacts; (2) the acceptability of specific policy and behavioral changes to a wide range of Oregonians; and (3) the barriers faced by individuals, groups, and organizations, including state agencies, as they start to respond to the observed impacts of climate change in Oregon. While the studies reported in this chapter focus primarily on individual understanding and response to climate change, we have no current research regarding organizational or institutional capacity for carrying out any policy or operational changes required to adapt to a changing climate in Oregon. The Oregon Public Health Department has an ongoing tracking and monitoring program for most of the infectious and communicable diseases likely to be affected by climate change. The best means of fending off 398 any changes for the worse due to climate change are similar to those already in place: ensuring that changes in disease patterns can be can detected, investigating as needed, and mounting an appropriate public health response as soon as possible.","Lach, Denise;Cone, Joe;Doppelt, Bob;Heumann, Michael;Inman, Tim;MacKendrick, Katie;Steel, Brent;Vynne, Stacy",ORESU-R-10-022,ORESU-R-10-022,A/SARP;M/A-21,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,Oregon Sea Grant,"Human dimensions of climate change: public knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to change; impacts on cultural and built environment; and potential public health impacts",NA,NA,"""Oregon Climate Change Assessment Report (Ocar) Legislative Summary,"" Chapter 9, pp. 397-417, 2010.",NA,NA,NA,NA

We examined low-DO effects on predation by hypoxia-​tolerant ctenophores, Mnemiopsis leidyi, on less hypoxia-​tolerant ichthyoplankton prey in laboratory experiments. We also examined the relationship between bottom DO concentrations and vertical distributions, and considered potential effects of biotic (predators and competitors) versus abiotic factors (low DO concentration, temperature, salinity, time of day) on vertical habitat overlaps between gelatinous zooplankton and their prey during summer in a Chesapeake Bay subestuary. Laboratory clearance rates of M. leidyi feeding on bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli) eggs and yolk sac larvae, and naked goby (Gobiosoma bosc) larvae were as high at low DO (1.5 mg l?1) as at high DO concentrations (7 mg l?1). Multiple years of field sampling at 2 sites revealed that the proportions of motile species in the bottom layer of the water column, especially fish larvae and copepods, increased with increasing bottom DO concentrations during both day and night. Ctenophore densities remained high in the bottom layer even at low DO concentrations. Vertical habitat overlaps among 4 motile predator?prey pairs (M. leidyi?copepods​, M. leidyi?naked goby larvae, bay anchovy larvae?copepods​, and naked goby larvae?copepods​) increased with increasing bottom DO concentrations (1st- or 2nd-order regression models). Vertical overlap between M. leidyi and fish eggs was significantly higher during the day than at night. Statistical models suggest that both bottom DO concentration and scyphomedusan predators influenced M. leidyi?fish egg nighttime and M. leidyi?copepod combined day?night overlaps. Hypoxia influences food web interactions more through altered habitat use and encounter rates than by directly affecting predation. Strong behavioral responses of larval fish and copepods to low bottom DO concentrations may decrease habitat overlap between M. leidyi predators and their prey.","Kolesar, Sarah E.;Breitburg, Denise L.;Purcell, Jennifer E.;Decker, Mary Beth",ORESU-R-10-025,ORESU-R-10-025,M/A-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,Oregon Sea Grant,"Effects of hypoxia on Mnemiopsis leidyi, ichthyoplankton and copepods: clearance rates and vertical habitat overlap",NA,NA,"""Marine Ecology Progress Series,"" 411:173-188, 2010.",NA,10.3354/meps086​56,NA,NA

The information was eclectic, and included observations about a wide range of conditions and interactions of various species. Reflecting back upon these times, both fishermen and scientists have commented that the relationships between them were also very important. Later a ""great gulf"" between scientists and fishermen developed, as scientists focused more on hiring fishing vessels to use as research platforms and less on engaging and learning from fishermen to develop research ideas or test hypotheses. Over the last decade, the tide has turned again, and there is growing interest and activity in cooperative fisheries research (CFR). Some fishermen are growing increasingly comfortable with science, and more scientists have realized that there is untapped potential for mutual learning. Others have addressed the procedural considerations for effective CFR. This paper expands that work by highlighting the importance of the relationships among partners, the costs and benefits to everyone involved in CFR, and how these are actually critical factors for the establishment and achievement of sound scientific goals.

To their dismay, fisheries social scientists find that much of their rich narrative with keen insights ends up filling pages that are neither read nor meaningfully integrated into decision-making in fisheries management. Yet what all scientists, practitioners, and managers want and need is information that will lead to a better understanding of the ecosystem (comprised of interdependent ecological and human systems) and therefore, to fisheries management that benefits the whole system. Believing that only a combination of high quality quantitative and qualitative data will provide both the numbers and the context needed for success in ecosystem-based management, in this paper we discuss efforts to present social and cultural information in forms more familiar to those who rely on models for a representation of reality in the fisheries context. We point out how the designers of these models (or how we) think the models might be applied to fisheries management, noting how each model attempts to incorporate qualitative data to depict context essential for grounding the more commonly used biological and economic models.

Managing the bycatch of yelloweye rockfish and minimizing the impact of commercial fishing on essential fish habitat requires fishery managers and stakeholders to evaluate and choose between management strategies that have different biological, social and environmental outcomes. A deficiency of biological, social and economic information to support such evaluations means the role of uncertainty must also be addressed in the decision-making process. The case studies show the major benefits of the Bayesian-based MCA to be the ability to: 1) Integrate biological, social and economic information measured in incommensurate units; 2) engage managers and stakeholders in the decision process increasing the probability of stakeholder buy-in for the decisions made; and 3) explicitly take into account uncertainty when evaluating alternative management strategies.

Vulnerability to climate change-enhanced hazards is not simply a matter of characterizing threatening physical processes but also involves assessing the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of human-​environmental systems that influence the potential for future impacts. The threats posed by climate change to PNW coastal communities can be more accurately communicated by integrating improved hazard models that incorporate climate-change controls with information on the vulnerability of communities to these hazards. To examine the influence of climate-change on community vulnerability to coastal hazards, we assessed variations in current and future societal vulnerability in Tillamook (Oregon) and Pacific (Washington) Counties. Model predictions of natural hazards under various climate-change scenarios are combined with current and projected socioeconomic indices using geographic-​information-​system (GIS) tools.

Coastal areas are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and the implications of sea-level rise. The U.S. coastal zone is home to the majority of the U.S. population with coastal counties representing 53% of the nation's population and is also a major contributor to the national economy, representing approximately 40% of the nation's economic output. Given the economic, social and environmental significance of the U.S. coastal zone, there is consensus that coastal communities must develop their capacity to adapt to climate change in order to protect people, property, and the environment along our nation's coasts. The U.S. coastal zone is highly complex and variable, consisting of several regions that are characterized by unique geographic, economic, social and environmental factors. The degree of risk and vulnerability associated with climate change will vary greatly depending on the exposure and sensitivity of coastal resources within a given area. These factors have a direct influence on the ability of coastal communities to adapt to the anticipated impacts of global climate change. The ability of coastal communities to effectively adapt to climate change will depend greatly on their ability to develop and implement feasible strategies that address unique local and regional factors.

The study confirmed the daily periodicity of otolith growth increments in a natural fish population under field conditions and validated fundamental assumptions about increased otolith strontium : calcium values during entry into saline waters. The otolith results indicated that more than 75% of the subyearling Chinook salmon captured near the mouth of the Salmon River had entered the estuary during the summer and that two-thirds of these fish had spent more than a month in the estuary before capture. Unlike in other Oregon coastal estuaries, in which the fingerling-​migrant portion of their life histories is dominant, approximately two-thirds of Salmon River Chinook salmon in upper-estuary marshes were early fry (,50- mm) migrants. A much smaller proportion at the river mouth suggests that many fry migrants did not survive to the lower estuary or passed undetected during ocean emigration. Nonetheless, the otolith results reveal a substantially greater contribution of estuarine-​rearing fry to the out-migrant population at the Salmon River than has been reported in other Oregon coastal basins. A small component of fall-migrating fish with long freshwater residence times also occurred at the river mouth. Most of these individuals had migrated quickly through the estuary. Rather than revealing a series of discrete ''types'' defined by the predominant rearing patterns in the population, the individual otolith results depict a continuum of freshwater and estuarine life histories that is consistent with reports of considerable phenotypic plasticity in Chinook salmon.

Analysis of this video footage created sampling and analytical guidelines of varying response times and behaviors of flatfish in affected waters, which will be valuable for future data collection and analyses.

Here, we quantified the impact of hypoxia on walleye habitat quality, using a spatially explicit growth rate potential (GRP) modeling approach, which integrates the spatial arrangement of biological (prey availability) and environmental (DO, temperature, irradiance) measures. Data were collected along two types of transects: 60 km north-south transects (each sampled once during day and night) and 5 km east-west transects (sampled every 4 h for 24 h) during August (pre-hypoxia), September (peak-hypoxia), and October (post-hypoxia) 2005. Overall, the average monthly amount of high quality habitat (GRP > 0 g*g-1*day-1) for walleye declined slightly with hypoxia (<2.0%); however, hypoxia appeared to enhance habitat quality by concentrating prey in favorable temperature, DO, and light conditions. In September, percentages of walleye growth rates were at the upper end of the range, much more so than during August or October. Although an understanding of walleye distributions, foraging, and growth in relation to hypoxia is needed, our results do not suggest that hypoxia is negatively influencing walleye through reduced habitat quality.","Brandt, Stephen B.;Constanini, Marco;Kolesar, Sarah;Ludsin, Stuart A.;Mason, Doran M.;Rae, Christopher M.;Zhang, Hongyan",ORESU-R-11-001,ORESU-R-11-001,M/A-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2011,Oregon Sea Grant,Does hypoxia reduce habitat quality for Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus)?

The separation point advances in the onshore direction with the bore front until the bore reaches the lowest point of the moving shoreline. The bore front continues to climb up onshore and collapses at the highest point of the moving shoreline. In the swash zone, flow attachment to the bed occurs during the transition from the uprush to downwash process. An internal flow circulation is generated at the flow reversal phase as the flow near the bed responds to the gravitational force earlier than the flow in the upper water column, where the uprush momentum is sustained later in phase. The magnitude of the downwash velocity in the swash zone is greater than that of the uprush process.

Precision measurements of water-surface variations are achieved with the aid of laser-induced fluorescent (LIF) technique and detailed features of the Mach reflection are captured. During the development stage of the reflection process, the stem wave is not in the form of a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) soliton but a forced wave, trailing by a continuously broadening depression. Evolution of stem-wave amplification is in good agreement with the Kadomtsev-​Petviashvili (KP) theory. The asymptotic characteristics and behaviours are also in agreement with the theory of Miles (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 79, 1977b, p. 171) except those in the neighbourhood of the transition between the Mach reflection and the regular reflection. The predicted maximum fourfold amplification of the stem wave is not realized in the laboratory environment. On the other hand, the laboratory observations are in excellent agreement with the previous numerical results of the higher-order model of Tanaka (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 248, 1993, p. 637). The present laboratory study is the first to sensibly analyse validation of the theory; note that substantial discrepancies exist from previous (both numerical and laboratory) experimental studies. Agreement between experiments and theory can be partially attributed to the large-distance measurements that the precision laboratory apparatus is capable of. More important, to compare the laboratory results with theory, the corrected interaction parameter is derived from proper interpretation of the theory in consideration of the finite incident wave angle. Our laboratory data indicate that the maximum stem wave can reach higher than the maximum solitary wave height.

Study results indicated that slimy and deepwater sculpin select different prey types and sizes. Selection for the shrimp-like crustacean Mysis diluviana was consistently greater for deepwater sculpin than for slimy sculpin, whereas selection for the amphipod Diporeia spp. was higher for slimy sculpin than for deepwater sculpin when Mysis was the only other available prey type. Slimy sculpin also exhibited higher selectivity for chironomids (order Diptera, family Chironomidae) compared with deepwater sculpin. Patterns in food resource partitioning were consistent between sampling periods covering different locations, seasons and depths, as well as between locations with varying levels of Diporeia availability. This consistency suggests (1) that differences in food use by the two species are associated with intrinsic differences in food preferences or feeding behaviors and (2) that Diporeia declines had not fundamentally altered the resource partitioning dynamics of the two species as of 2002. The results also indicated that slimy and deepwater sculpin can partition food resources on the basis of prey size since deepwater sculpin tended to select larger Diporeia than slimy sculpin. Differences in prey selection may mediate competitive interactions between slimy and deepwater sculpin directly by reducing diet overlap in areas of sympatry or indirectly by causing these fish to select different depth habitats.","Hondorp, Darryl W.;Pothoven, Steven A.;Brandt, Stephen B.",ORESU-R-11-007,ORESU-R-11-007,M/A-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2011,Oregon Sea Grant,Feeding selectivity of slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus and deepwater sculpin Myoxocephalus thompsonii in southeast Lake Michigan: implications for species coexistence,NA,NA,"""Journal of Great Lakes Research,"" 37(1):165-172, 2011.",NA,10.1016/j.jglr.​2010.11.010,NA,NA

Where possible, we indicate estimates of the key economic values arising from these services, and discuss how the natural variability of ECEs impacts their benefits, the synergistic relationships of ECEs across seascapes, and management implications. Although reliable valuation estimates are beginning to emerge for the key services of some ECEs, such as coral reefs, salt marshes, and mangroves, many of the important benefits of seagrass beds and sand dunes and beaches have not been assessed properly. Even for coral reefs, marshes, and mangroves, important ecological services have yet to be valued reliably, such as cross-ecosystem nutrient transfer (coral reefs), erosion control (marshes), and pollution control (mangroves). An important issue for valuing certain ECE services, such as coastal protection and habitat-fishery linkages, is that the ecological functions underlying these services vary spatially and temporally. Allowing for the connectivity between ECE habitats also may have important implications for assessing the ecological functions underlying key ecosystems services, such coastal protection, control of erosion, and habitat-fishery linkages. Finally, we conclude by suggesting an action plan for protecting and/or enhancing the immediate and longer-term values of ECE services. Because the connectivity of ECEs across land-sea gradients also influences the provision of certain ecosystem services, management of the entire seascape will be necessary to preserve such synergistic effects. Other key elements of an action plan include further ecological and economic collaborative research on valuing ECE services, improving institutional and legal frameworks for management, controlling and regulating destructive economic activities, and developing ecological restoration options.","Barbier, Edward B.;Hacker, Sally D.;Kennedy, Chris;Koch, Evamaria W.;Stier, Adrian C.;Silliman, Brian R.",ORESU-R-11-014,ORESU-R-11-014,R/CNH-15;R/ECO-19,reprints (peer-reviewed),2011,Oregon Sea Grant,The value of estuarine and coastal ecosystem services,NA,NA,"""Ecological Monographs,"" 81(2):169-193, 2011.",NA,10.1890/10-​1510.1,NA,NA

In this study, we examine a different facet of congeneric comparisons in which both species are non-native. Ecological variability among non-native congeners might 1) lead to the inhibition or facilitation of either species' ability to colonize and spread, 2) result in larger cumulative impacts due to synergies between species, and 3) depend on the physical context of the invaded habitat. To explore these possibilities, we studied the distribution and abundance of two non-native beach grasses: European beach grass Ammophila arenaria and American beach grass Ammophila breviligulata, their interaction with one another, and their biotic and physical impacts on dune ecosystems of the Pacific coast of North America. We found that over a two-decade period, A. breviligulata has increased its dominance over A. arenaria on dunes where it was originally planted in 1935 and has actively spread to new sites formerly dominated by A. arenaria. Our results also show that dune plant species richness was lower at A. breviligulata sites, although there was an increase in the native beach grass Elymus mollis. More significantly, we found that the two grass species are associated with significantly different foredune shapes that are likely controlled by a combination of variability in sand supply along the coast and subtle differences in the congeners' morphology and growth form. These differences have significant implications for the coastal protection services of dunes to humans and the conservation of native species.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/6354681_3692_2816706.csv,392,"""Resilience holds the key to our future. It is a deceptively simple idea, but its application has proven elusive,"" wrote Jane Lubchenco, administrator of NOAA. Fishery management programs designed to control Pacific salmon for optimum production have failed to prevent widespread fish population decline and have caused greater uncertainty for salmon, their ecosystems, and the people who depend upon them. Strengthening salmon resilience will require expanding habitat opportunities for salmon populations to express their maximum life-history variation. Such actions also may benefit human communities by expanding the opportunities for people to express diverse social and economic values. The 11 essays in this book represent the most-forward thinking about resilience and Pacific salmon collected to date, and they point to new ways we may consider and interact with this iconic fish. It should be of interest not only to those active in fisheries but also to policymakers-​-​-​and, by extension, to those interested in the resilience of other ecological and social systems.;The following essays are included in this book: 1.

Predictable inundation of river floodplains and expansion of stream networks like these are major processes influencing entire aquatic communities (which include fish, frogs, salamanders, insects, clams, snails, and crustaceans-​such as crayfish and small shrimp like organisms) (Tockner and Stanford 2002). Flood control and improved drainage has been achieved through channel straightening, wetland filling, dike construction and ditch development (Benner and Sedell 1997). Flood control efforts, however, are not effective enough to keep many grass seed producing fields in the Willamette Valley from becoming partly submerged on an annual basis. The goal of our study was to determine wheth​er invertebrate community composition (i.e., species present) and biomass (i.e., mass of living organisms in a given area at a given time) differed between wetlands in grass seed fields and wetlands in native wet prairies as a result of the frequency of soil disturbance from tillage.","Wyss, L.

Though crabbing has been a mainstay of west coast economies for decades, little information had previously been collected or analyzed on adult Dungeness crab movement in general and for the Oregon coast in specific. To begin addressing this critical information gap, the Oregon Wave Energy Trust (OWET), the Oregon Dungeness Crab Commission (ODCC), and Oregon Sea Grant added value to a planned baseline study conducted by H.T. Harvey and Associates. Crabs collected for the baseline study were tagged after they were measured and before they were returned to the ocean. Commercial crabbers who then caught the tagged crabs were paid $20 for each tag returned to Oregon Sea Grant. The resulting data revealed that crabs travelled distances ranging from 0.27 km to 90.68 km; 65% of crabs traveled less than 20 km, 77.7% of crabs traveled less than 30 km, and 95.5% of crabs traveled less than 50 km. Crabs moved primarily in the alongshore direction, with minimal across-shelf movement. The distances reported here represent a minimum distance that crabs traveled. Additional tags were returned with general locations indicating that crabs may be moving as far north as Tillamook, Oregon (approximately 140 miles). It remains unknown to what degree Dungeness crab movements vary from year to year. The findings of this study should be treated as preliminary rather than definitive. Additional studies are needed to fully characterize adult Dungeness crab movements in Oregon's coastal waters.","Hildenbrand, Kaety;Gladics, Amanda J.;Eder, Robert",ORESU-T-11-001,ORESU-T-11-001,A/ESG-07,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2011,Oregon Sea Grant,"Adult male Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) movements near Reedsport, Oregon from a fisheries collaborative mark-recapture study",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Salmon fisheries are now managed to protect ""weak"" stocks. If a river population, for example from the Klamath River, has numbers too low to harvest, ocean fishing can be closed for all stocks until the population rebounds. Project CROOS is developing new methods to help fishermen harvest healthy salmon stock and avoid fishing weak stock. Fishermen catch salmon and sample fin clips for scientists to analyze DNA. Genetic information allows CROOS scientists to match an individual salmon to its river or region of origin, thus determining whether it comes from weak or healthy stock. With the goal of helping fishermen find healthy stock in the ocean, Project CROOS is investigating the relationship between stock distribution and ocean variables. Project CROOS is also developing an information network (www.pacificfis​htrax.com) where data collected by fishermen can be shared by scientists, fishermen, managers, processors, marketers, and the general public.

Reduced oxygen availability has the potential to cause mortality or indirect sublethal effects, including reduced feeding and growth rates, changes in behavior and distribution, and increased encounter frequency with predators or prey. Detailed analyses of spatial distributions of environmental factors and fishes in the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay and the Northern Gulf of Mexico suggest that spatial distributions and other habitat features, such as water temperature and the timing of hypoxia, have species and ecosystem specific effects. Indeed some fishes may actually benefit from hypoxia. Research needs to focus on these complex interactions, including the degree of overlap between predators and prey habitats, and changes in the habitat quality and growth rate potential of fishes.

Invasive species that are also ecosystem engineers can substantially alter physical features in an environment, and this can lead to cascading effects on the biological community. Aquatic-​terrestrial interface ecosystems are excellent systems to study the interactions among invasive ecosystem engineers, physical features, and biological communities, because interactions among vegetation, sediment, and fluids within biophysical feedbacks create and modify distinct physical features. Further, these systems provide important ecosystem services including coastal protection afforded by their natural features. In this dissertation, I investigate the interactions and feedbacks among sand-binding beach grass species (a native, Elymus mollis (Trin.), and two non-natives, Ammophila arenaria (L.) Link and A. breviligulata Fernald), sediment supply, and dune shape along the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast. Dunes dominated by A. arenaria tend to be taller and narrower compared to the shorter, wider dunes dominated by A. breviligulata. These patterns suggest an ecological control on dune shape, and thus, coastal vulnerability to overtopping waves. I investigate the causes and consequences of these patterns with experiments, field observations, and modeling. Specifically, I investigate the relative roles of vegetation and sediment supply in shaping coastal dunes over inter-annual and multi-decadal time scales (Chapter 2), characterize a biophysical feedback between beach grass species growth habit and sediment supply (Chapter 3), uncover the mechanisms leading to beach grass coexistence and whether A. breviligulata can invade and dominate new sections of coastline (Chapter 4), and examine the non-target effects resulting from management actions that remove Ammophila for the recovery of the threatened Western Snowy plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus) (Chapter 5). I found that vegetation and sediment supply play important roles in dune shape changes across inter-annual and multi-decadal time scales (Chapter 2). I determined that a biophysical feedback between the beach grass growth habits and sediment supply results in species-​specific differences in sand capture ability, and thus, is a likely explanation for differences in dune shape (Chapter 3). I found that all three beach grass species can coexist across different sediment deposition rates, and that this coexistence is largely mediated by positive direct and indirect species interactions. I further determined that A. breviligulata is capable of invading and dominating the beach grass community in regions where it is currently absent (Chapter 4). Combined, these findings indicate that A. breviligulata is an inferior dune building species as compared to A. arenaria, and suggest that in combination with sediment supply gradients, these species differences ultimately lead to differences in dune shape. Potential further invasions of A. breviligulata into southern regions of the Pacific Northwest may diminish the coastal protection ability of dunes currently dominated by A. arenaria, but this effect could be moderated by the predicted near co-dominance of A. arenaria in these lower sediment supply conditions. Finally, I found that the techniques used to remove Ammophila for plover recovery have unintended consequences for the native and endemic dune plant communities, and disrupt the natural disturbance regime of shifting sand. A whole-ecosystem restoration focus would be an improvement over the target-species approach, as it would promote the return of the natural disturbance regime, which in turn, would help recover the native biological community. The findings from this dissertation research provide a robust knowledge base that can guide further investigations of biological and physical changes to the coastal dunes, can help improve the management of dune ecosystem services and the restoration of native communities, and can help anticipate the impacts of future beach grass invasions and climate change induced changes to the coast.","Zarnetske, Phoebe Lehmann",ORESU-Y-11-001,ORESU-Y-11-001,R/CNH-15;R/ECO-19,theses/disserta​tions,2011,Oregon Sea Grant,"The influence of biophysical feedbacks and species interactions on grass invasions and coastal dune morphology in the Pacific Northwest, USA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper shares an example of a young Alaska fisherman who did just that: his history, his experience, his education and research at Oregon State University studying the vulnerability of fishing communities to climate change and variability, and now his job with an Alaska seafood company. In short, walking proof of how investing in higher education-near and far-can contribute to Alaska's fishing community sustainability.","Conway, Flaxen D.L.;Berns, Hunter",ORESU-WR-11-013,ORESU-WR-11-013,A/ESG-07,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2011,Oregon Sea Grant,Investing in higher education--near and far--can contribute to Alaska's fishing community sustainability,NA,NA,"""Fishing People of the North: Cultures, Economies, and Management Responding To Change,"" 27th Lowell Wakefield Fisheries Symposium, pp. 85, Anchorage, Alaska, September 14-17, 2011.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The mathematical theory predicts that the amplification at the reflection is not twice, but four times the incident wave amplitude. Evidently, this has an important implication to engineering design practice. Our laboratory experiments verify detailed features of the Mach reflection phenomenon, whereas contradict the theory in terms of the maximum four-fold amplification: the maximum amplification observed in the laboratory was 2.9, instead. The reason for the discrepancy is discussed. In addition, we show that a tsunami along the reflective wall can reach higher than the maximum solitary wave height. Once the wave breaking happens along the wall, the substantial increase in water-surface slope results along the wave crest away from the wall.","Yeh, Harry;Li, Wenwen",ORESU-R-11-020,ORESU-R-11-020,R/CNH-17;R/CNH-20,reprints (peer-reviewed),2011,Oregon Sea Grant,Tsunami amplification and breaking along a vertical wall,NA,NA,"Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Asian and Pacific Coasts (APAC 2011), pp. 59-70, Hong Kong, China, December 14-16, 2011",NA,10.1142/9789814​366489_0006,NA,NA

While bottom hypoxia can strongly affect sessile benthic animals, its effects on mobile organisms such as fish are less understood. We evaluated the potential for bottom hypoxia to affect the growth rates of yellow perch Perca flavescens, a species of ecological and economic importance in the lake. To this end, we (1) conducted laboratory experiments to quantify the effects of reduced dissolved oxygen on consumption, somatic growth, and RNA:DNA ratios (an index of short-term growth) of young yellow perch and (2) explored the effects of bottom hypoxia on young yellow perch growth in Lake Erie's central basin by collecting individuals in hypoxic and normoxic regions of the lake and quantifying their RNA:DNA ratios. Yellow perch consumption and growth in our experiments declined under hypoxic conditions (≤2 mg O2/L). While yellow perch RNA:DNA ratios responded strongly to experimental temperature, nucleic acid ratios were not significantly affected by dissolved oxygen or feeding ration. We did, however, observe a positive correlation between yellow perch growth and RNA:DNA ratios at low temperatures (11◦C). The nucleic acid ratios of yellow perch collected in Lake Erie varied spatiotemporall​y, but their patterns were not consistent with hypoxia. In short, while yellow perch consumption and growth rates respond directly and negatively to low oxygen conditions, these responses are not necessarily reflected in RNA:DNA ratios. Moreover, in central Lake Erie, where yellow perch can behaviorally avoid hypoxic areas, the RNA:DNA ratios of yellow perch do not respond strongly to bottom hypoxia. Thus, this study suggests that there is no strong negative effect of bottom hypoxia on the growth of young yellow perch in Lake Erie.","Roberts, James J.;Brandt, Stephen B.;Fanslow, David;Ludsin, Stuart A.;Pathoven, Steven A.;Scavia, Donald;Hook, Tomas O.",ORESU-R-11-026,ORESU-R-11-026,M/A-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2011,Oregon Sea Grant,"Effects of hypoxia on consumption, growth, and RNA:DNA ratios of young yellow perch",NA,NA,"""Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,"" 140(6):1574-​1586, 2011.",NA,10.1080/0002848​7.2011.638576,NA,NA

Life history and biogeography data for each NOAA Trust Species will be used along with toxicity data to determine the greatest risk for exposure/impact to help inform BMPs. NOAA needs this information to develop a pesticides general permit application as it relates to NOAA Trust Species. Challenges of this project include addressing NOAA Trust Species when there is very limited direct impact data as well as extrapolating data from surrogate species which may have more toxicity and impact data.

Although state-space models have been used to analyze time series for some time, only recently have the e↵ects of integrating multiple observations within a time step been explored. Collecting replicated samples within a time step may allow for more accurate and precise estimates of the non-process variance, therefore leading to more accurate estimates of the parameters governing the underlying ecological process, which is generally what ecologists are concerned with. In this dissertation, I adapt a log-linear state-space model that incorporates multiple observations at each time step to three di↵erent contexts. In the first chapter I examine the tradeo↵s between the length of a time series and the number of total observations and the e↵ect of that data structure on the precision of estimating the probability of quasi-​extinction in a population viability analysis (PVA). The results of this simulation study demonstrate that for species with relatively high process variance, a monitoring program that takes multiple observations during each time step will generate more precise estimates of the probability of quasi-​extinction compared to a program that takes only a single observation each time step. These results can be used to efficiently design e↵ective monitoring schemes for species of conservation concern. In the second chapter, I analyze the e↵ect of habitat alteration, specifically the conversion of sagebrush to agricultural land, on the population dynamics of twelve bird species in the Great Basin of the intermountain west, using multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models. All twelve species show strong support for equivalent growth rates between sagebrush and agricultural habitat, but a number also have support for unequal growth rates. Three of the four species most associated with sagebrush habitat show a noteworthy risk of decline, which contrasts with the population trend estimated as part of the standard breeding bird analysis. In the third chapter, I develop a state-space model for standardizing catch-​per-​unit-​e↵ort (CPUE) data into an index of abundance, while accounting for various covariates such as depth, gear type and fishing area. I compare the state-space model with a more standard delta lognormal model by applying them both to the wintery fishery for petrale sole o↵ the Washington and Oregon coast. Both models estimate similar indices, but the state-space model is slightly more precise in its estimate.

Many insects and diseases that are a threat to these forest resources can be transported inside firewood. When campers transport their firewood across borders and ecosystems they can simultaneously spread invasive species into campgrounds and parks. In response to this risk, a campaign was developed to inform campers in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho about the risk of invasive species being transported through firewood. There are two main objectives of this research study. The first objective is to measure the effectiveness of this campaign in informing campers about the risk of invasive species moving through firewood. The second objective is to conduct an audience analysis of Pacific Northwest campers to identify key characteristics of campers and develop a mental model of their views, knowledge, and beliefs regarding invasive species and firewood that may be used to guide future risk communication tailored to campers needs and perceptions. Two surveys were conducted with PNW campers, a pre and post-campaign survey, in order to measure the impact of the risk communication campaign. Twenty-seven PNW campers participated in in-depth interviews where they were asked to describe their basic camping practices, environmental values, and invasive species knowledge. Their responses were coded and analyzed for dominant beliefs and major decision-making influences. The results indicate that there was an increase in campers' exposure to information about invasive species in firewood after the completion of the campaign.

The effects of these factors differ with fish life history stage, but will ultimately affect how salmonids utilize freshwater nursery habitats and influence their size at smolting. Although juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) (Walbaum 1792) movement patterns and their relationships with body mass have been previously examined, the temporal scale considered in most studies has been within individual seasonal periods. In this study, we monitored the movement of PIT tagged juvenile coho salmon throughout the period of freshwater residence in an entire southern Oregon coastal basin to identify the prevalent sedentary and mobile strategies these fish may adopt and to examine possible relationships between those strategies and fish body mass, growth and survival. Specific objectives include: 1) to describe juvenile coho salmon movement strategies and patterns during the freshwater residence period; 2) to determine the relative proportions of juvenile coho salmon that exhibit each movement strategy; 3) to establish whether juvenile coho salmon body mass and growth rates are related with a set of habitat variables recorded during this study; 4) to determine whether coho salmon body mass or growth rates are related to movement strategy; and 5) to evaluate whether winter survival of juvenile coho salmon is associated with movement strategy. Results revealed seasonally and spatially variable movement. More than half of coho salmon tracked throughout the period of freshwater residence exhibited movement behavior that differed between summer and winter seasons. Within seasonal periods, coho salmon in tidally affected reaches exhibited greater prevalence of mobile behavior relative to those in riverine reaches. Regression analysis indicated coho biomass density, habitat unit structural complexity and size at tagging were important in predicting summer growth of coho salmon. Juvenile coho salmon that were mobile during summer were either larger or no different in body mass in early summer relative to fish that exhibited sedentary behavior. Similarly, no consistent differences were observed between sedentary and mobile coho salmon in regards to summer growth. Coho salmon that were sedentary in summer and winter experienced higher apparent winter survival than mobile fish in each season, though the reach in which an individual resided at the start of winter appeared to also affect survival. Coho salmon residing in the tide gate reservoir reach and mainstem headwater reaches experienced greatest apparent winter survival. These results indicate that juvenile coho salmon movement within a stream basin is spatially and temporally variable and that mobility does not necessarily indicate inferior competitive ability. In a broader context, variable movement patterns reflect the capacity for plastic behavior in salmonids and this research demonstrates the importance of maintaining seasonally diverse freshwater and estuarine nursery habitats for juvenile fish.","Webright, Adam D.",ORESU-Y-11-008,ORESU-Y-11-008,A/ESG-07,theses/disserta​tions,2011,Oregon Sea Grant,"Juvenile coho salmon movement, growth and survival in a coastal basin of Southern Oregon [electronic]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidently, this has an important implication to engineering design practice. Our laboratory experiments verify detailed features of the Mach reflection phenomenon, whereas contradict the theory in terms of the maximum four-fold amplification: the maximum amplification observed in the laboratory was 2.9, instead. The reason for the discrepancy is discussed. In addition, we show that a tsunami along the reflective wall can reach higher than the maximum solitary wave height.

Mud shrimp beds are prominent features of estuary mudflats and provide critical habitat for at least 15 commensal species. Populations of mud shrimp along the eastern Pacific have declined 18% per year or more in all inhabited estuaries over the last decade due to infestation by the introduced bopyrid isopod parasite, Orthoine griffenis. Bopyrid isopods cause blood loss and effectively castrate their hosts. This isopod is particularly effective at reducing Upogebia populations because they can reduce host fitness to zero without increasing host mortality. The largest remaining populations of Upogebia are on the central Oregon coast, and the Alsea Bay population is relatively unstudied. This assessment serves to establish a baseline description of the Alsea Bay Upogebia population by estimating abundance, spatial extent and biomass, and to determine the population dynamics such as size-frequency distributions and isopod infestation rates.Our results conclude that the Upogebia population in Alsea Bay is significant. These shrimp densely inhabit 22.9% in tideland in the estuary, with a total biomass of 404.4 +/- 157.8 metric tons.

Ceratomyxa shasta is a myxozoan parasite of salmonids that requires a freshwater polychaete Manayunkia speciosa to complete its lifecycle. In the Klamath River, CA/OR, C. shasta causes significant mortality in juvenile salmon, imposing social and economic losses on sport and tribal fisheries. An interest in manipulating the polychaete host to decrease the abundance of C. shasta in this system has therefore developed. Manayunkia speciosa is a small (3mm) benthic filter-feeding worm that attaches itself perpendicularly to substrate through construction of a flexible tube. There are several hydropower dams on the Klamath River and pulsed flows as well as gravel augmentation have been proposed as methods to decrease M. speciosa populations through scouring action. The presence of the dams, and their projected deconstruction in 2020 have also raised questions of whether the dams are influencing disease dynamics and what changes might be anticipated with their removal. One hypothesis is that dam construction has increased polychaete habitat by modifying the natural flow regime, leading to amplification of C. shasta. Unfortunately, there are limited data on the life-cycle and habitat requirements of M. speciosa or the influence of streamflow regime and hydraulics on their population dynamics. This work aims to address the data need by characterizing the physical habitat utilized by M. speciosa and applying a hydraulic model at a study site to investigate how habitat changes under a range of flow conditions.

In reality, the ocean isn't the final frontier; it is already highly used, highly valued, and highly demanded. The space desired for wave energy development in Oregon, is some of the most productive crabbing grounds off of the west coast. Coupled with an Oregon directive to create marine reserves, the use for nearshore ocean space is creating an intensely stressed fishing industry and coastal community at large. Involving the coastal community and fishing industry in the decision making process about wave energy development is critical. In Oregon, the fishing industry has relatively little organizational structure, especially for cross-sectored representation, and groups that represent both commercial and recreational fishing were, until recently, non-existent. The successful engagement of these interests involves first building the capacity, giving them to skills to engage, and making sure there is an actual path for their engagement.

In 2010, Oregon and California ocean fisheries were sampled weekly from May through September, providing the first broad-scale application of this technique. Data were assembled in a central data base where they can be associated with supporting data sets including oceanographic data, satellite observations, and coded-wire tag data. Results can be used to examine patterns of distribution at regional (1000 km) to local (1km) scales. Applications include coast-wide fishery management, scientific investigations of salmon migratory behavior in relation to the dynamic ocean environment, and a resource for individual fishermen to track and understand their fishing operations. Through the Pacific Fish Trax website, www.pacificfish​trax.org, data base access, analysis, and mapping tools are being developed to serve a broad audience. The web site is designed to provide access tailored to the needs of specific user groups, and to be extended to accommodate new species, data types, and users.

In tact sediment cores were incubated in the laboratory, in the dark, after placing gold amalgam voltammetric microelectrodes at four depths within the core. These microelectrodes enabled us to continuously analyze multiple redox species simultaneously at discrete depth intervals within the core. Solid phase analyses of pre- and post-incubation cores provided molar organic C:N:P ratios and stable isotopic signatures of organic carbon and nitrogen. The coupled C:P - δ13C technique (Ruttenberg and Goni 1997) was used to evaluate sources of organic matter (terrestrial versus marine) to each study site, which has implications for organic matter lability. Apparent metabolic rates were estimated using net rates of oxygen (O2) production and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) consumption from evolving concentrations at each microelectrode depth, detected in real time over the course of the incubation. After normalizing metabolic rates to the concentration of organic matter present, we find the expected trend of lowest rates in sites dominated by terrestrial organic matter, and highest rates at sites dominated by marine organic matter, reflecting the progression from refractory terrestrial- to more labile marine-derived organic matter. Contrasting pre- and post-incubation molar organic C:N:P ratios and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures reveals alterations to source organic matter during earliest diagenesis as simulated by the incubation experiment (e.g. 48 hours). In conclusion, laboratory whole-core incubations using depth-arrayed microelectrodes provide a novel and powerful approach to the study of metabolic reactions, and subsequent buildup of porewater redox sensitive constituents, in marine sediments during early diagenesis. When linked with analysis of indices of organic matter source in pre- and postincubation sediments, metabolic rates can be directly tied to the lability of the organic matter present.","Briggs, R.

We found that tsunami penetration into the Columbia River is quite different from a typical river. The tsunami enters the vast river estuary through the relatively narrow river mouth of the Columbia, which damps and diffuses its energy. The tsunami transforms into a long period, small amplitude wave that advances to Portland, 173 km from the ocean.

The response of society to change is often overlooked in studies that focus primarily on the biophysical sciences to develop alternative future scenarios and predict system responses. If the interactions between society and the ecological system are poorly represented or left out of modeling approaches, this will compromise our understanding of feedbacks to the system, and the potential consequences of policy or management actions. Through Stakeholder Learning Action Networks we are gathering project-​relevant knowledge in a co-learning environment on water use, management, policies and issues that impact stakeholders, and the types of project outputs desired by stakeholders. This information is useful for understanding the social- ecological system feedbacks, anticipating water scarcity, and informing integrative water systems responses. Modeling tools that can generate and explore alternative outcomes based on different sets of social and ecological conditions and their interaction within the system could also lead to a better understanding of ecosystem resilience and help guide decision making in the face of climate change and potential water scarcity.","Santelmann, M.;McDonnell, J.;Bolte, J.;Chan, S.;Morzillo, A.

El Ni�o events are often associated with lower ice cover. The interference of impacts of ENSO and NAO complicates the relationship between ice cover and either of them.

The correlation coefficient between the quadratic Nino3.4 index and ice cover (-0.48) becomes significant at the 99% confidence level. The nonlinear response of Great Lakes ice cover to ENSO is mainly due to the phase shift of the teleconnection patterns during the opposite phases of ENSO.

Among them, cefotaxime (16% resistance among isolates) was the antibiotic associated with more activity, while the least active was tetracycline (77% resistant). Knowing information about the diversity of bacteria in imported ornamental fish, as well as the resistance profiles for the bacteria will be useful in more effectively treating clinical infected fish, and also potential zoonoses in the future.","Rose, S.;Hill, R.;Bermudez, L.

Alternatively, the evolution of high surface-​to-​volume ratios coupled with minimal genomes containing high-affinity transporters enables unusually efficient metabolism for oxidizing dissolved organic matter in the world's oceans that could support vast population sizes despite phage susceptibility. These ideas are important for understanding plankton ecology because they emphasize the potentially important role of top-down mechanisms in predation, thus determining the size of SAR11 populations and their concomitant role in biogeochemical cycling. Here we report the isolation of diverse SAR11 viruses belonging to two virus families in culture, for which we propose the name 'pelagiphage', after their host. Notably, the pelagiphage genomes were highly represented in marine viral metagenomes, demonstrating their importance in nature. One of the new phages, HTVC010P, represents a new podovirus subfamily more abundant than any seen previously, in all data sets tested, and may represent one of the most abundant virus subfamilies in the biosphere. This discovery disproves the theory that SAR11 cells are immune to viral predation and is consistent with the interpretation that the success of this highly abundant microbial clade is the result of successfully evolved adaptation to resource competition.","Zhao, Yanlin;Temperton, Ben;Thrash, J.

A wide range of hobbies combine fun and learning-​intensive practices, and can contribute to scientific literacy. Hobby learning involves clear goal orientation, persistence and effort, and often results in more richly and strongly connected knowledge; traits highly valued in both in and out-of-school science learning. In this study, I used koi hobbyists as subjects to discover and explore hobbyists' information-​seeking strategies under different learning scenarios. I approached koi hobbyists' learning about koi and their koi hobby in both quantitative and qualitative ways. I designed a Stage of Engagement Model to illustrate koi hobbyists' engagement with their hobby, and adapted Falk and Dierking's Contextual Model of Learning to explain how personal, socio-cultural and physical contextual factors affect koi hobbyists' learning. An instrument was developed to assess koi hobbyists' experience with keeping koi, knowledge about the hobby, motivation/goal​s, interaction with other hobbyists, and the information-​seeking strategies they used under different learning scenarios. I administered this questionnaire to koi hobbyist communities in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and online. Based on the quantitative analysis, the results supported my hypotheses that koi hobbyists chose different information-​seeking strategies based on personal contextual factors such as previous experience, motivation and learning goals; socio-cultural contextual factors such as interactions with other koi hobbyists; and physical contextual factors such as the nature of the problems they encounter. Koi hobbyists also chose different information-​seeking strategies based upon their stage of engagement with their hobby. The long-term potential of this study is to offer insights into how learners construct their knowledge by applying different learning strategies under different personal, socio-cultural and physical circumstances, and to provide a framework for the future study of other kinds of hobbies and hobbyists that will help to promote public scientific literacy.","Liu, Chi-Chang",ORESU-Y-12-001,ORESU-Y-12-001,R/SAQ-09;A/ESG-09-PD;R/IEd-10;R/SF-35-PD,theses/disserta​tions,2012,Oregon Sea Grant,Serious fun: life-deep learning of koi hobbyists,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The goal of this project is to provide a set of resources and examples of aquatic pesticide toxicity to NOAA Trust Species and BMPs to NOAA Fisheries Service agents and private and public resource managers. The products produced by this project are 1) an aquatic pesticide and NOAA Trust Species database, 2) a technical report synthesizing case studies and an aquatic pesticide BMP framework for aquatic pest control, and 3) an aquatic pesticide BMP framework applied to salmon habitat restoration programs for peer reviewed publication. The products produced by this project are to assist NOAA Fisheries agents in consulting on the issuance of the EPA's 2011 National Pollutant Discharge and Elimination System (NPDES) Pesticide General Permit and to continue to provide assistance to NOAA Fisheries in determining entity eligibility and helping managers apply for inclusion under the 2011 NPDES Pesticide General Permit. The project products can also be used by private and public resource managers when developing and implementing aquatic pest control action plans with regards to the use of aquatic pesticides. The database highlights substantial gaps in ecotoxicity data of aquatic pesticides impacts to NOAA Trust Species. Taking a BMP approach to pesticide uses can help compensate for these gaps. Pest control managers, habitat restoration managers, and NOAA Fisheries Service agents will benefit from easily accessible, synthesized information on aquatic pesticides, their potential toxicity to NOAA Trust Species, and pesticide BMPs specific to aquatic pest control. Tools that could be utilized by all of these stakeholders could increase communication between these parties.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/6421163_1321_2814335.csv,141,"As competing uses of our coastlines increase, natural resource agencies are employing marine spatial planning (MSP) to designate areas for different uses or activities in order to reduce conflicts while achieving ecological, economic and social objectives. A central challenge of implementing MSP is development of a rigorous approach for analyzing tradeoffs across the provision of ecosystem services (i.e., the benefits humans receive from nature). This study develops an operational approach to this problem that is founded on community-based methods, ecological production theory, and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The approach merges ecological models with surveys to identify marine ecosystem services for use in tradeoff analysis. The approach allows for a single set of marine ecosystem services to at once be valued by local stakeholders and measured by biologists, thus connecting social and biological monitoring efforts. To develop the approach in a real-world context, I examined ecosystem services associated with nearshore marine ecosystems in Oregon, where marine reserves are being introduced for biodiversity conservation. I worked with stakeholder focus groups in three Oregon communities to identify 24 marine ecosystem services. I then linked the ecosystem services with ecological indicators, which I then consolidated to derive 11 items for use in a survey-based tradeoff analysis exercise. I administered the survey to a nonrandom sample of stakeholders in Oregon (n=31), from which their relative preferences and preference weights for ecosystem services were derived. The weights and preference measures may then be used in MSP decision-​making. Furthermore, I grouped the stakeholder survey data in three ways: by location of residence (coastal vs. non-coastal), by eight categories of affiliation (e.g., business owners, conservationist​s, commercial and recreational fishers, etc.), and by resource use patterns. I then analyzed the various groupings of stakeholders for within- and between-group homogeneity of preferences. Results of the analyses showed that there are statistically significant variations in preferences within and between most groupings. Capturing the variations in stakeholder preferences is important when developing policies that affect different stakeholder groups. Thus, when implementing the survey instrument, I suggest random sampling of stakeholders stratified by location, affiliation, and resource use. This study provides one of the first examples of a systems-based approach to ecosystem service valuation operationalized to inform MSP, and novel features of the approach have a number of implications for advancing marine research and management. First, by using stakeholders to identify ecosystem services, the approach allows for a tailored implementation of ecosystem-based management at the community level. Second, by integrating ecological and economic information on the provision and value of ecosystem services, the approach provides relevant data for MSP decision-making during the siting, evaluation, and monitoring stages. And third, by applying both stated-​preference and MCDA methods, the approach may capture the array of values represented by diverse stakeholder groups.","Freeman, Peter M.",ORESU-Y-12-003,ORESU-Y-12-003,R/CC-12,theses/disserta​tions,2012,Oregon Sea Grant,A community-based approach for evaluating tradeoffs across marine ecosystem services in Oregon,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Latent KHV infection was demonstrated in white blood cells from each of these populations.

Even similar species may impart different effects due to variation in their interactions and feedbacks with the environment. Consequently, replacement of one engineering species by another can cause significant change in the physical environment. Here we investigate the species-​specific ecological mechanisms influencing the geomorphology of U.S. Pacific Northwest coastal dunes. Over the last century, this system changed from open, shifting sand dunes with sparse vegetation (including native beach grass, Elymus mollis), to densely vegetated continuous foredune ridges resulting from the introduction and subsequent invasions of two nonnative grass species (Ammophila arenaria and Ammophila breviligulata), each of which is associated with different dune shapes and sediment supply rates along the coast. Here we propose a biophysical feedback responsible for differences in dune shape, and we investigate two, non-mutually exclusive ecological mechanisms for these differences: (1) species differ in their ability to capture sand and (2) species differ in their growth habit in response to sand deposition. To investigate sand capture, we used a moveable bed wind tunnel experiment and found that increasing tiller density increased sand capture efficiency and that, under different experimental densities, the native grass had higher sand capture efficiency compared to the Ammophila congeners. However, the greater densities of nonnative grasses under field conditions suggest that they have greater potential to capture more sand overall. We used a mesocosm experiment to look at plant growth responses to sand deposition and found that, in response to increasing sand supply rates, A. arenaria produced higher-density vertical tillers (characteristic of higher sand capture efficiency), while A. breviligulata and E. mollis responded with lower-density lateral tiller growth (characteristic of lower sand capture efficiency). Combined, these experiments provide evidence for a species-​specific effect on coastal dune shape. Understanding how dominant ecosystem engineers, especially nonnative ones, differ in their interactions with abiotic factors is necessary to better parameterize coastal vulnerability models and inform management practices related to both coastal protection ecosystem services and ecosystem restoration.","Zarnetske, Phoebe L.;Hacker, Sally D.;Seabloom, Eric W.;Ruggiero, Peter;Killian, Jason R.;Maddux, Timothy B.;Cox, Daniel",ORESU-R-12-012,ORESU-R-12-012,R/CNH-15,reprints (peer-reviewed),2012,Oregon Sea Grant,Biophysical feedback mediates effects of invasive grasses on coastal dune shape,NA,NA,"""Ecology,"" 93(6):1439-​1450, 2012.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Our case study concerns the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), in which students negotiate the terms of use of an MPA while assuming the identities of individuals with interests in the use and/or protection of the MPA.","Richmond, Courtney E.;Kolesar, Sarah E.",ORESU-WR-12-003,ORESU-WR-12-003,M/A-1,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2012,Oregon Sea Grant,Consensus building for environmental issues: marine protected areas as a case study,NA,NA,"""Tested Studies for Laboratory Teaching,"" Proceedings of the Association for Biology Laboratory Education, Volume 33, pp. 302-310, 2012.",NA,NA,NA,NA

The effects of low oxygen levels on fish and invertebrate communities, particularly during early-life history stages, however, are poorly known for this area. I investigated the effects of hypoxia on the density, community structure, vertical and horizontal distribution of fish larvae and juveniles, as well as body condition of juveniles, along the central Oregon and Washington coasts during the summers of 2008 - 2011. During this sampling period, bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) values ranged from 0.49 to 9.85 ml l-1, and the number of hypoxic (e.g., < 1.4 ml l-1) stations sampled was low compared to 2002 and 2006 (only 54 sampling stations for the ichthyoplankton study out of 493, and only 12 stations out of 90 for the benthic juvenile study). From the ichthyoplankton study, I found that the overall density of fish larvae increased as bottom-DO values increased; however, the effect on individual species density was limited. Between 44.65 oN and 46.00 oN (~Florence, OR - Astoria, OR), fish larvae altered their vertical distribution when bottom-DO was low by rising in shallower water layers. From the benthic juvenile study, I found that English sole (Parophrys vetulus), butter sole (Isopsetta isolepis), speckled sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus) and Pacific sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus) dominated the catch with annual variation in abundances. Species composition, abundance and length had strong relationships with depth. Species abundance for English sole (< 75 mm), speckled sanddab (<100 mm) and Pacific sanddab also increased with increased bottom-DO. However, the body condition of butter sole (< 75 mm) and of large speckled sanddab (≥100 mm) increased with decreased bottom-DO. Overall my research elucidates important patterns of larval and juvenile fish distribution within the NCC during summer. In both studies I have found a limited effect of DO on abundance, distribution and community assemblages. Variables other than DO, such as depth, season and location, dominated the explained variance of the intervening multivariate and univariate analysis. However, due to the paucity of samples during hypoxic events, continued monitoring of nearshore larval and juvenile species over varying hypoxic conditions is necessary for understanding the impact of hypoxia on these communities and subsequent adult populations.","Johnson, Angela M.",ORESU-Y-12-004,ORESU-Y-12-004,R/ECO-23,theses/disserta​tions,2012,Oregon Sea Grant,An investigation of the distribution and abundance of ichthyoplankton and juvenile benthic fishes in relation to nearshore hypoxia within the Northern California current system,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mate choice was evaluated as a potential mechanism contributing to these observed RS differences using a previous pedigree of wild spawning hatchery-reared and wild origin coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Genetic variance at immune-relevant genes was used as a metric to examine mate choice. Two years (2005 and 2006) of three wild spawning mate pair classes were examined: wild x wild (W x W), hatchery x hatchery (H x H), and wild x hatchery (W x H). We tested for: (1) a departure from random expectations with regard to mate pair allelic diversity at immune-relevant markers, (2) a correlation between immune-relevant gene diversity and mate pair RS, and (3) distinguishable differences between mate choice strategies used by hatchery-reared and wild origin coho. Eight immune-relevant gene-linked microsatellite markers were used to evaluate mate choice; four linked to immune-relevant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and four linked to the Major Histocompatibil​ity Complex (MHC). We found evidence for non-random mating between 2006 W x H mate pairs at BHMS429, an MHC-linked marker, and at SsalR016TKU, an immune-relevant EST-linked marker, which was identified as a vasodilator-​stimulated phosphoprotein. Non-random mating was also evident between 2005 H x H pairs at SsalR015TKU, an immune-relevant EST-linked marker, though no putative gene was identified. All other pair classes did not display a significant mate choice signature. We found a significant correlation between mate pair RS and immune gene diversity among 2005 and 2006 W x W mate pairs as well as 2006 W x H mate pairs. Notably, H x H mate pair RS was not correlated to immune gene diversity in either year. Results suggest that mate choice and genetic compatibility may influence fitness of wild spawning coho.","Whitcomb, Amelia C.",ORESU-Y-12-005,ORESU-Y-12-005,R/RCF-32,theses/disserta​tions,2012,Oregon Sea Grant,"Mate choice of wild spawning coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in the Umpqua River, Oregon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of this project was to advance the wave predictive capabilities of the states of Oregon and the southwest part of Washington by including the effects of local bathymetric features in the operational forecasts. A 30 arc-second resolution wave forecasting model was implemented making use of the WAVEWATCH III numerical code covering the coastal region from Klamath, CA to Taholah, WA. The wave forecasts extend to the continental shelf at this resolution. To assess the performance of the model, its output was compared against in situ data, with normalized root-​mean-​squared errors in significant wave height in the vicinity of 0.20 and linear correlation coefficients greater than 0.80. Making use of the resulting validated regional scale wave forecasting system, an evaluation of the model sensitivity to the inclusion of bottom friction and wind input at the shelf level was performed. Results suggest that neither dissipation due to bottom friction or wind generation are significant for long term forecasting/hin​dcasting in the region. Results from a series of hindcasts suggest that several significant offshore features may affect the nearshore wave field. To evaluate it, a shelf scale SWAN model was implemented and a series of numerical experiments performed. Results suggest that the Astoria and McArthur Canyons; the Stonewall, Perpetua, and Heceta Banks; and Cape Blanco are significant bathymetric features that are capable of producing significant alongshore variability in wave heights nearshore.","Garcia-Medina, Gabriel",ORESU-Y-12-008,ORESU-Y-12-008,R/CNH-19,theses/disserta​tions,2012,Oregon Sea Grant,Nearshore wave predictions along the Oregon and southwest Washington coast,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But the increase in number and type of uses of ocean space and resources coupled with recognized declines in the state of some resources and the ecosystems upon which they depend has led managers to contemplate and design multi-use ecosystem oriented approaches to ocean planning, with the latest driver identified as renewable energy development. Here, we provide a brief overview of five leading examples of coastal marine spatial planning (CMSP) at the state level in the U.S.: California, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island. For each state, we examine the impetus, apparatus (legislative control, stakeholder process, benefits/drawba​cks), and status to illustrate influences on and approaches to CMSP. This examination highlights the degree to which each state employs attributes deemed important to CMSP. We find that the legislative detail driving each CMSP effort varies, as does the delegation of planning authority to relevant administrative bodies.

Conflict can and does occur, however, when two or more groups wish to use the same space at the same time in an exclusive manner. The potential for conflict is well known and the management of ocean space and resources has been, and is being, addressed by a number of State, regional, and Federal organizations, including, among others, coastal zone management agencies, state task forces, and regional fisheries management councils. However, with new and emerging uses of the ocean, such as aquaculture and offshore renewable energy, comes the potential for new types of space-use conflicts in ocean waters. In recent years, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) (formerly the Minerals Management Service [MMS]) has examined ocean space-use conflicts and mitigation strategies in the context of offshore oil and gas exploration and production and sand and gravel dredging, activities that are both subject to BOEM regulation and oversight. BOEM now has authority to issue leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for renewable energy projects, but seeks additional information on potential conflicts between existing uses of the ocean environment and this new form of activity.1 The broad purpose of this study was to begin to fill this gap by (1) identifying potential space-use conflicts between OCS renewable energy development and other uses of the ocean environment, and (2) recommending measures that BOEM can implement in order to promote avoidance or mitigation of such conflicts, thereby facilitating responsible and efficient development of OCS renewable energy resources.

Precision measurements of water-surface variations are achieved with the aid of laser-induced fluorescent (LIF) technique and detailed temporal and spatial features of the Mach reflection are captured. During the development stage of the reflection process, the stem wave is formed with the wave crest perpendicular to the wall; this stem wave is not in the form of a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) soliton but a forced wave, trailing by a continuously broadening depression wave. Evolution of stem-wave amplification is in good agreement with the Kadomtsev-​Petviashvili (KP) theory. The asymptotic characteristics and behaviors are also in agreement with the theory of Miles (1977b) except those in the neighborhood of the transition between the Mach reflection and the regular reflection. The maximum fourfold amplification of the stem wave at the transition predicted by Miles is not realized in the laboratory environment: the maximum amplification measured in the laboratory is 2.92, which is however in excellent agreement with the numerical results of Tanaka (1993). The present laboratory study is the first to sensibly analyze validation of the theory; note that substantial discrepancies exist from previous (both numerical and laboratory) experimental studies. Agreement between experiments and theory can be partially attributed to the large-distance measurements that the precision laboratory apparatus is capable of. More important, to compare the laboratory results with theory, the corrected interaction parameter is derived from proper interpretation of the theory in consideration of the finite incident wave angle. Our laboratory data indicate that the maximum stem wave can reach higher than the maximum solitary wave height. The wave breaking along the wall results in the substantial increase in wave height and slope away from the wall. Extending the foregoing study on the reflection of a single solitary wave at a vertical wall, laboratory and numerical experiments are performed on two co-propagating obliquely incident solitary waves with different amplitudes that are reflected at the wall. The larger wave catches up with the smaller wave; hence the two waves collide with the strong interaction. The resulting wave pattern near the wall is complex due to the interaction among the two incident solitons and the two reflected solitons. The numerical predictions of the KP theory are in good agreement with the experimental results. Another comparison of the KP theory with laboratory experiments is demonstrated for one of the exact soliton solutions of the KP equation by Chakravarty and Kodama (2009). This solution is called the T-type solution by Kodama. The theoretically predicted formation of the 'box'-shape wave pattern in the vicinity of two-soliton intersection is realized in the laboratory tank. The agreement between the laboratory observation and the KP theory is found better for the cases with the larger wave amplitude a and smaller oblique angle (i.e. tan =(p3a cos ) < 0:6). Subtle and unavoidable differences among the analytical KP solution, the setup of numerical calculation, and the laboratory condition are discussed.","Li, Wenwen",ORESU-Y-12-009,ORESU-Y-12-009,R/CNH-20,theses/disserta​tions,2012,Oregon Sea Grant,Amplification of solitary waves along a vertical wall,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the Klamath River (California), current thermal conditions are considered sub-optimal for juvenile salmon. In addition to borderline temperatures, these fish must contend with the myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa shasta, a significant cause of juvenile salmonid mortality in this system. This paper presents 2 studies, conducted from 2007 to 2010, that examine thermal effects on C. shasta-induced mortality in native Klamath River Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon. In each study, fish were exposed to C. shasta in the Klamath River for 72 hr and then reared in the laboratory under temperature-​controlled conditions. The first study analyzed data collected from a multi-year monitoring project to asses the influence of elevated temperatures on parasite-​induced mortality during the spring/summer migration period. The second study compared disease progression in both species at 4 temperatures (13, 15, 18, and 21 C) representative of spring/summer migration conditions. Both studies demonstrated that elevated water temperatures consistently resulted in higher mortality and faster mean days to death. However, analysis of data from the multi-year monitoring showed that the magnitude of this effect varied among years and was more closely associated with parasite density than with temperature. Also, there was a difference in the timing of peak mortality between species; Chinook incurred high mortalities in 2008 and 2009, whereas coho was greatest in 2007 and 2008. As neither temperature nor parasite density can be easily manipulated, management strategies should focus on disrupting the overlap of this parasite and its obligate hosts to improve emigration success and survival of juvenile salmon in the Klamath River.","Ray, R.

We used percent mortality and degree-days to death to measure disease severity in fish. We analyzed water samples using quantitative PCR and Sanger sequencing, to determine total parasite density and relative abundance of C. shasta genotypes, which differ in their pathogenicity to salmonids. We detected the parasite throughout the study zone, but parasite density and genetic composition fluctuated spatially and temporally. Chinook and coho mortality increased with density of their specific parasite genotype, but mortality-​density thresholds and time to death differed. A lethality threshold of 40% mortality was reached with 10 spores liter21 for Chinook but only 5 spores liter21 for coho. Parasite density did not affect degree-days to death for Chinook but was negatively correlated for coho, and there was wider variation among coho individuals.

Direct quantification of the density of host-specific parasite genotypes in water samples offers a management tool for predicting host population-​level impacts.","Hallett, Sascha L.;Ray, R.

In order to install technology to capture this energy, however, it may be necessary to mitigate conflict with existing ocean space users. The objective of this research was to construct a conflict analysis model in a GIS to answer the following research questions: (1) Within the study area off the coast of Oregon, where are stakeholders currently using ocean space and how many uses overlap? (2) To what extent might existing ocean space use present potential for conflict with renewable energy development? (3) How do various types of uncertainty affect analysis results? (4) What are the implications of these findings for ecosystem based management of the ocean? All available spatial information on ocean space usage by commercial fishing, commercial non-fishing, recreational, Native American, and scientific communities was gathered. Stakeholder outreach with these communities was used to vet the collected data and allow each to contribute knowledge not previously available through GIS data clearinghouses maintained by government or interest groups. The resulting data were used as inputs to a conflict visualization model written in Python and imported to an ArcGIS tool. Results showed extensive coverage and overlap of existing ocean space uses; specifically that 99.7% of the 1-nm2 grid cells of the study area are occupied by at least 6 different categories of ocean space use. The six uses with the greatest coverage were: Fishing - Trolling, Habitat, Military, Fishing - Closure Areas, Protected, and Marine Transportation - Low Intensity. An uncertainty analysis was also completed to illustrate the margin for error and therefore the necessity of appropriate stakeholder outreach during the renewable energy siting process, as opposed to relying only on a GIS. Ranking of each category by its potential for conflict with renewable energy development demonstrated which areas of the ocean may be particularly contentious. Because rankings are subjective, a tool was created to allow users to input their own rankings. For the purpose of this report, default rankings were assigned to each as justified by the literature. Results under these assumptions showed that space use and potential for conflict were highest between the coast and approximately 30 nm at sea. This is likely because certain space use is limited by depth (e.g., recreational use); there is increased shipping density as vessels approach and depart major ports; and increased fuel costs associated with traveling further from shore. Two potential applications of model results were demonstrated. First, comparison with existing wave energy permit sites highlighted relative potential for conflict among the sites and the input data detailed the specific uses present. Second, comparison with areas determined most suitable for development by the wave energy industry illustrated that areas of high suitability often also had high rankings for potential for conflict. It appeared that the factors that determined development suitability were often the same factors that drew current ocean space users to those locations. Current support at the state, regional and federal level under the National Ocean Policy for the use of marine spatial planning as a tool to implement ecosystem based management of the oceans requires that tools such as the one developed in this research are used, to ensure that all components of the marine ecosystem are considered prior to implementation of a management plan. The addition of renewable energy to the current social landscape of the ocean will reduce the resource base for many categories of ocean space use. Model results demonstrated that mitigation of conflict between development and existing space use is not merely a best practice supported by current policy, but a necessity. Results presented a visualization of the social landscape of the ocean that could help managers determine which stakeholders to engage during the initial stage of choosing a site for development.","Sullivan, Colleen M.",ORESU-Y-12-014,ORESU-Y-12-014,R/CC-11-PD,theses/disserta​tions,2012,Oregon Sea Grant,Assessment of the potential for conflict between existing ocean space use and renewable energy development off the coast of Oregon,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Major findings feed into Oregon Sea Grant's objective of better understanding how to support coastal communities and their planning. We found that most coastal professionals believe and are mostly sure that their communities will experience the local effects of climate change, but that many (40 percent) coastal professionals were not currently involved in adaptation planning. We found that of the communities involved in planning, most were still in the first phase (""understanding​"") of climate change planning. Climate change planning ranks low on the list of priorities for coastal professionals, and most believe that while their professional efforts toward addressing climate change would benefit the community, a combination of governments and other organizations should initiate a local response to the likely effects of climate change. We surveyed coastal professionals on other topics important to our objective of better understanding how to support planning. Knowing that worldviews and values affect adaptation planning Executive Summary processes (Kahan et al., 2011; Ekstrom et al., 2010), we asked about worldviews and found there was little polarization in our test population. Barriers to climate change planning supported this finding opposition to climate change planning was not encountered by as many coastal professionals as expected; instead, lack of agreement over importance of climate change effects and lack of urgency regarding climate effects were rated highly as hurdles to planning. This finding is consistent with the finding that other potential stressors to the community, such as preparing for tsunami/earthqu​ake hazards and the economy, are taking priority. Finally, we asked about what specific information needs coastal professionals had. Most needed was information about diverse environmental and social considerations: the cost of climate adaptation, how to communicate climate risks, flooding or saltwater intrusion, species and habitat vulnerability, social and economic vulnerabilities​, and predictions of ecosystem impacts. Findings from this survey will be communicated to coastal professionals, including through the creation of both this report and expository videos. For the videos, experts on various main insights or themes of the survey will be interviewed to reflect on climate change adaptation planning on the Oregon coast. Data from the survey will also be used in a national report that will compare findings from other states and regions where a mostly identical survey was conducted with local coastal professionals.","Winters, Kirsten",ORESU-S-13-001,ORESU-S-13-001,M/A-21,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2013,Oregon Sea Grant,Coastal climate change survey results for Oregon 2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Imagine being able to look out your back window at a beautiful natural body of water. Imagine how important that river would be to you. Wouldn't you want to do everything you can to both (a) maintain your access to the beautiful river and (b) maintain the quality of the river's water? Therefore, how do community and regional planners implement land use policies that allow landowners to accomplish both of those goals? Implementing policies that protect the land immediately adjacent to a body of water can be a complicated process. Known as riparian ordinances, these policies are meant to regulate urban development near rivers, creeks, and streams in order to protect water quality. Many times, however, landowners are resistant to these types of policies. Riparian ordinances are viewed by some landowners as a violation of their property rights. This conflict is complicated because both sides are valid. As individuals, no one wants their government to set seemingly arbitrary restrictions regarding what can and can't be done on private property. On the other hand, as members of a community, no one wants to see the quality of their water detrimentally impacted by a stubborn and selfish landowner. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how planning scholars may actively and strategically engage with the public to have their research impact public deliberation, policy, and practice. The case studies for this project are three small cities located in the State of Oregon: Turner, Coburg, and Shady Cove. Utilizing methods such as document analysis, participant observation, and interviews with landowners, land use planners, and policymakers, this project draws upon Cultural Theory to help uncover the varied rationalities that must be considered when attempting to implement a riparian ordinance. The commoditization of land is at the center of this issue.

For salmonids in the Pacific Northwest of North America, increasing temperatures pose tighter thermal constraints on their habitat use as well as aspects of their individual performance, such as disease resistance. This thesis examines the effect of temperature on the phenology of the Ceratomyxa shasta life cycle, the effect of thermal refugia on disease risk in juvenile salmonids in the Klamath River, CA, and the spatial and temporal distribution of C. shasta in the Willamette River, OR. We developed a biological model that predicts an acceleration of the C. shasta life cycle development due to climate shifts in the Klamath River, resulting in more generations per year and earlier seasonal parasite occurrence. We showed that in early summer the Beaver Creek-Klamath River confluence provides juvenile Chinook and coho salmon an area of lower parasite doses and cooler temperatures than the main stem, thus lessening disease risk. By accelerating the development of C. shasta in its hosts, increasing temperatures will result in earlier parasite transmission to juvenile salmonids and a longer season of infectivity. These fish may find disease refuge at cold tributary inflows to the main stem of the Klamath River in early summer, further adding to the benefit of these important thermal habitats. To determine if similar disease patterns occur in other rivers with the parasite, we described spatial and temporal occurrence of C. shasta in the Willamette River. By collecting weekly water sampling at four sites over 28 months we characterize seasonal and annual differences of parasite abundance, which varies with weekly temperature. We also collected samples along the length of the main stem and its tributaries and identified spatial differences in C. shasta spore densities. Identification of spatial and temporal variation of C. shasta in the Willamette River provides a foundation for understanding future patterns of disease occurrence in this river where conservation of anadromous fisheries is also of concern. This thesis identifies likely responses of C. shasta to climate warming in the Klamath River, with useful application to other rivers in the Pacific Northwest.","Chiaramonte, Luciano V.",ORESU-Y-13-003,ORESU-Y-13-003,R/BT-47,theses/disserta​tions,2013,Oregon Sea Grant,Climate warming effects on the life cycle of the parasite Ceratomyxa shasta in salmon of the Pacific Northwest [electronic],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An extremely abundant and promising source of energy exists in the world's oceans. Ocean energy exists in the forms of wave, tidal, marine currents, thermal (temperature gradient) and salinity. Among these forms, significant opportunities and benefits have been identified in the area of ocean wave energy extraction, i.e., harnessing the motion of the ocean waves, and converting that motion into electrical energy. Wave energy can be considered a concentrated form of solar energy in that it is the uneven heating of the earth's surface that creates the winds, and it is the wind that generates the waves.

Oregon Sea Grant conducted a web-based survey of Oregon coastal professionals to target climate change adaptation outreach and engagement efforts toward this audience. The following variables were examined in this research: climate change information needs, subjective norms about climate change, perceptions of climate change risk, feelings of responsibility to respond to climate change, and behavioral intentions to adapt to climate change. Relationships among these variables were investigated using an ordinary least squares regression path analysis. While coastal professionals are highly concerned about effects of climate change and feel responsible to mitigate and adapt to effects, they have low amounts of information on the climate change topics they consider important for the performance of their work. Coastal professionals who have more information on climate change have lower perceptions of risk and lower feelings of responsibility to adapt to climate change, possibly because greater information suggests that climate change is less of an issue. Perceptions of risk and feelings of responsibility were found to positively influence behavioral intentions to adapt to climate change, explaining one third of intentions. The low level of information on important climate change topics among coastal professionals indicates a need to engage them on issues of concern. Follow up focus group meetings and interviews could provide insight into the negative relationship between information and perceptions of risk, and feelings of responsibility for adapting to climate change; and an improved understanding of the drivers of behavioral intentions to adapt.","Borberg, Jenna",ORESU-Y-09-003,ORESU-Y-09-003,A/SARP-1;E/INT-99,theses/disserta​tions,2009,Oregon Sea Grant,"Climate change adaptation: information needs, concerns, and behavioral intentions among Oregon coast professionals",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Widespread diking and drainage of estuarine marshes for agricultural and urban development may have contributed to a decline in salmon abundance in the Pacific Northwest, prompting efforts to restore estuarine salmon habitat in the region. I investigated the growth and residence patterns of age-0 Chinook salmon in two blind tidal channels in the Salmon River estuary, Oregon. One channel drained a natural high salt marsh in ""reference"" condition, and the other channel was in an adjacent salt marsh, restored to tidal inundation in 1996 after being diked and controlled by a tide gate for thirty five years. Recapture of individually marked fish indicated salmon growth rates were similar in the two channels, though growth rates varied more seasonally in the restored site. Average minimum residence times of individual fish were approximately ten days in each channel, and individual salmon were observed up to 79 and 117 days after initial marking in the reference and restored channels, respectively. To characterize movement of age-0 salmon within tidal channels, I tested the feasibility of stationary Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) detection within a small (approximately 8m wide) tidal channel within the natural marsh system. I found that a stationary PIT detector was an effective tool for monitoring tagged fish movement in a brackish water channel network. Salmon movements in the channel were asymmetrical about high slack tide, with peak movement frequency occurring late during both flood and ebb tide periods. Most movements were in the direction of tidal currents, but 20% of individuals entered the channel against the ebbing tide. Individuals occupied the intertidal channel for a median 4.9 hours and as long as 8.9 hours per tidal cycle, and few were detected moving when water depth was <0.4m. Some individuals used the channel on multiple successive tidal cycles, and others entered intermittently over periods up to 109 days. This research used individual-​based fish marking methods to quantify juvenile Chinook salmon behavior and performance within tidal marsh channels, assessing functional equivalence of natural and restored sites and demonstrating the value of such habitats for conservation and restoration of salmon populations.","Hering, David K.",ORESU-Y-09-004,ORESU-Y-09-004,R/ECO-14,theses/disserta​tions,2009,Oregon Sea Grant,"Growth, residence, and movement of juvenile Chinook salmon within restored and reference estuarine marsh channels in Salmon River, Oregon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There are also two marginally significant relationships between 100m riparian buffer LCLU and MW EC including: 1) agriculture during the wet season and 2) clear cut during the dry season. A lack of significant relationships between MW FIB and larger scales LCLU may be due to: 1) limited bacterial survival, 2) unaccounted for geomorphic effects, 3) coarse scale LCLU data which is 8 years old and 4) local presence of STP or OSDS to sampling site. EC in MW was likely from a human source as the TC/EC ratio was below 10 during the wet season. Considering a likely human source, it is concerning that ENT didn't have a similar relationship with LCLU as EC. However, our results showed that ENT is capable of growing in intertidal sediments. As suggested by previous studies it is likely that intertidal ENT was resuspended into the water column which could have confounded relationships with LCLU. This study shows that MW FIB concentrations are significantly correlated to upstream FW concentrations but only when comparing a single species across water bodies. There is no correlation between FW EC and MW ENT. Taken together these data show that FW streams are a major delivery mechanism of FIB to nearshore marine waters but this relationship is not evident when comparing two different FIB species (i.e. FW EC and MW ENT). This brings into question the validity of current monitoring methods. We also found that there was significantly more EC in FW than MW. In contrast, ENT had similar concentrations across both water body types. We hypothesize that ENT from intertidal sediments were resuspended via wave action and are thus served as an additional source of ENT to the MW column. From this study we have learned that: 1) LCLU impacts on MW are season, scale and species dependent, 2) currently used indicators (FW EC and MW ENT) make it difficult to examine the link between marine and terrestrial systems in regards to fecal pollution and 3) neither EC nor ENT is ideal for monitoring fecal pollution due to survival and growth in the environment. In order to better understand how nearshore marine water quality is affected by adjacent terrestrial systems, it is imperative that a universal indicator of fecal pollution be identified which can be used in both marine and freshwaters.","Hillman, Amanda Kay",ORESU-Y-09-005,ORESU-Y-09-005,R/ECO-21-PD,theses/disserta​tions,2009,Oregon Sea Grant,"The terrestrial-​marine connection of fecal pollution: examining land use impacts and indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

All stock assessments and management decisions for North Pacific albacore are presently based on the assumption of a single, uniform stock. However, a growing body of evidence from diverse sources suggests that there are two subgroups of albacore in the coastal fishery of North America. These subgroups are believed to occur north and south of 40� North latitude. This study investigated the existence of the proposed subgroups using more than 40 years of albacore logbook and port sampler data provided by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center. I examined regional differences in the coastal albacore fishery using three metrics: 1) catch per unit effort (CPUE), 2) entry and exit date, and 3) size composition. Distinct regional differences were observed for each metric. Spatial mapping of average CPUE by month suggested that migration into the coastal fishery occurs at two distinct locations: approximately 45� North latitude and 30� North latitude. Availability within seasons, expressed as average CPUE by month, differed between the two regions. Average entry and exit dates were also different between the two regions, with the northern region starting on average one month later (July) and ending one month earlier (October) than the southern region. Moreover, albacore from the southern region averaged 2.5 cm longer than those caught in the northern region. These results support previous findings and suggest that the coastal albacore fishery is comprised of two subgroups with distinct migration routes and size characteristics​. The results may have implications for the management of this fishery, particularly if these subgroups represent separate and distinct stocks. Because this study did not examine spawning distribution, further research (possibly using genetics) is needed to determine if the subgroups spawn independently in space and time.","Barr, Charles M.",ORESU-Y-09-006,ORESU-Y-09-006,R/RCF-27-PD,theses/disserta​tions,2009,Oregon Sea Grant,"Are there two subgroups of albacore, Thunnus alalunga, in the North Pacific?

Distinguishing between these questions helps clarify the restoration planning process, which has four distinct steps: (1) identify the restoration goal, (2) select a project prioritization approach that is consistent with the goal, (3) use watershed assessments to identify restoration actions, and (4) prioritize the list of actions. A well-crafted restoration goal identifies the biological objective of restoration, addresses underlying causes of habitat change, and recognizes that social, economic, and land use objectives may constrain restoration options. Once restoration goals are identified, one of six general approaches can be selected for prioritizing restoration actions: project type, refugia, decision support systems, single-species analysis, multispecies analysis, and cost effectiveness. Prioritizing by project type, refugia, or a decision support system requires the least quantitative information, and each approach is relatively easy to use. Single-species, multispecies, and cost effectiveness approaches require more information and effort but often most directly address legal requirements. Watershed assessments provide most of the information used to identify and prioritize actions and should be explicitly and carefully designed to support the goals and prioritization scheme. Watershed assessments identify causes of habitat degradation, habitat losses with the greatest effect on biota and ecosystems, and local land and water uses that may limit restoration opportunities. Results of assessments are translated into suites of restoration options, and analysis of land use and economic constraints helps to evaluate the feasibility of various options. Finally, actions are prioritized based on assessment results and the selected prioritization scheme. In general, we recommend the use of simple decision support systems for cases in which watershed assessments provide incomplete information; the cost effectiveness approach is recommended for cases in which watershed assessments identify (1) restoration actions needed to restore riverine habitats, (2) biological benefits associated with each action, and (3) costs of restoration actions.","Beechie, T.;Pess, G.;Roni, P.;Giannico, G.",ORESU-R-08-014,ORESU-R-08-014,A/ESG-07,reprints (peer-reviewed),2008,Oregon Sea Grant,Setting river restoration priorities: a review of approaches and a general protocol for identifying and prioritizing actions,NA,NA,"""North American Journal of Fisheries Management,"" 28(3):891-905, 2008.",NA,10.1577/M06-​174.1,NA,NA

First, the model is tested for numerical limitations on the higher order bottom slope and curvature terms using idealized cases of a simple depth transition and a symmetric trapezoidal trench, with comparisons of the MMSE to both the traditional mild slope equation (MSE) solution and a shallow water analytic solution. It is demonstrated that the model gives accurate solutions on slopes as steep as 1:1, and that the solutions from all three models agree in the shallow water region. However, for waves in intermediate depths, predicted wave reflection from nearshore depressions is shown to differ significantly between the MMSE and MSE models. Next, geometrical data from a wide range of existing and proposed borrow pits and a submarine canyon are gathered and analyzed for whether wave reflection is an important process near realistic nearshore depressions. The geometric data show that realistic nearshore depressions lie within the tested range of the MMSE model and that borrow pits are generally not in shallow water, which means it is important to use a MMSE-type model to calculate reflection from these features. In addition, storm conditions on average lead to a 50% increase in reflection coefficient in comparison to the mean wave conditions, due to the increase in wave period.

Habitat restoration strategies that address limited environmental attributes and partial salmon life-history requirements or approaches that attempt to force aquatic habitat to conform to idealized but ecologically unsustainable conditions may partly explain this lack of response. Natural watershed processes generate highly variable environmental conditions and population responses, i.e., multiple life histories, that are often not considered in restoration. Examples from several locations underscore the importance of natural variability to the resilience of Pacific salmon. The implication is that habitat restoration efforts will be more likely to foster salmon resilience if they consider processes that generate and maintain natural variability in fresh water. We identify three specific criteria for management based on natural variability: the capacity of aquatic habitat to recover from disturbance, a range of habitats distributed across stream networks through time sufficient to fulfill the requirements of diverse salmon life histories, and ecological connectivity. In light of these considerations, we discuss current threats to habitat resilience and describe how regulatory and restoration approaches can be modified to better incorporate natural variability.","Bisson, Peter A.;Dunham, Jason B.;Reeves, Gordon H.",ORESU-R-09-036,ORESU-R-09-036,M/A-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2009,Oregon Sea Grant,Freshwater ecosystems and resilience of Pacific salmon: habitat management based on natural variability,NA,NA,"""Ecology and Society,"" 14(1): Article #45, 2009.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Community and cultural resiliency have also been undermined, especially by the recent emphasis on economic efficiency, which has concentrated access in the hands of a few and has disenfranchised fishery-​dependent communities. Recent declines in both salmon stocks and salmon prices have revealed the systemic failure of the current management system. If salmon and their fisheries are to become viable again, radically new management policies are needed. For the salmon species, the emphasis must shift from maximizing yield to restoring resilience; for salmon fisheries, the emphasis must shift from maximizing economic efficiency to maximizing community and cultural resilience. For the species, an approach is needed that integrates harvest management, habitat management, and habitat enhancement to sustain and enhance resilience. This is best achieved by giving fishing and aboriginal communities greater responsibility and authority to manage the fisheries on which they depend.

In this special feature introduction, we explore several key attributes of ecosystem resilience that have been overlooked by traditional salmon management approaches. The dynamics of salmon ecosystems involve social-​ecological interactions across multiple scales that create difficult mismatches with the many jurisdictions that manage fisheries and other natural resources. Of particular importance to ecosystem resilience are large-scale shifts in oceanic and climatic regimes or in global economic conditions that unpredictably alter social and ecological systems. Past management actions that did not account for such changes have undermined salmon population resilience and increased the risk of irreversible regime shifts in salmon ecosystems. Because salmon convey important provisioning, cultural, and supporting services to their local watersheds, widespread population decline has undermined both human well-being and ecosystem resilience. Strengthening resilience will require expanding habitat opportunities for salmon populations to express their maximum life-history variation. Such actions also may benefit the ""response diversity"" of local communities by expanding the opportunities for people to express diverse social and economic values.

Several studies and observations have recently provided new insights into the fate of nomads and the role of the stream-estuary ecotone and estuary in developing this life history strategy that promotes coho resilience. Chinook and sockeye salmon have developed the ocean-type life-history strategy to exploit the higher productivity of the estuarine environment and migrate to the ocean at age 0. Nomad coho can acclimate to brackish water, and survive and grow well in the stream-estuary ecotone and estuary, but instead of migrating to the ocean they return upstream into freshwater to overwinter before migrating to the ocean as smolts. Nomads may enter the estuarine environment from natal or non-natal streams, rear there throughout the summer, and then emigrate to a non-natal stream for overwintering and smolting in the spring.

A comparable event is expected for the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) which will impact the west coast of North America. Research efforts have focused on understanding and predicting the hazard to mitigate potential impacts. This thesis presents two manuscripts which pertain to estimating infrastructure damage and determining design loads of tsunami inundation. The first manuscript estimates damage to buildings and economic loss for Seaside, Oregon, for CSZ events ranging from 3 to 25 m of slip along the entire fault. The analysis provides a community scale estimate of the hazard with calculations performed at the parcel level. Hydrodynamic results are obtained from the numerical model MOST and damage estimates are based on fragility curves from the recent literature. Seaside is located on low lying coastal land which makes it particularly sensitive to the magnitude of the events. For the range of events modeled, the percentage of building within the inundation zone ranges from 9 to 88%, with average economic losses ranging from $2 million to $1.2 billion.

Head-on collisions and oblique collisions of equal-amplitude as well as unequal-​amplitude waves were examined. Precision measurements of water-surface variations were made with the LIF technique that revealed detailed features of the collision process of counter-​propagating solitary waves. Comparisons of the laboratory results with the theory of Su and Mirie (1980) are made in terms of the maximum amplitude and found in good agreement. The phase shift resulting from collision is found to be dependent on wave amplitude, which is in a qualitative agreement with Su & Mirie's (1980) immediate post-collision prediction. The solitary waves lose a small amount of energy after collision. Waves with larger amplitude before collision have greater amplitude reduction. The secondary waves resulting from collision is also compared with Su & Mires' (1980) theory. The secondary wave form measured in the laboratory is in good agreement with the theory. Our laboratory results also include oblique collision cases, while Su & Mirie's (1980) theory is developed for the head-on collision conditions only. The oblique collision cases that we investigated are those with small oblique angles (up to 20�) due to the limitation of our basin breadth. We find no difference essentially with or without oblique interaction angle. PIV technique was used to explore variations of the boundary-layer formation under the collisions. With the resolved velocity field, which has high resolution both in space and time, flow acceleration, vorticity, and pathline for bottom boundary layer flow are computed and analyzed. Detailed description of the flow field transition during the collisions is presented. Layered formation of the boundary-layer structure immediately after the collision is observed for symmetric collisions. This layered formation is a consequence of the overshoot associated with the viscous diffusion in a flow reversal. We identify flow separation and attachment based on vorticity field along the bed. Flow separation happens prior to reaching collision peak when two solitary waves merge. Flow attachment occurs after the collision peak when two waves separate from each other. The separation/atta​chment point is fixed at the collision point for symmetric collision, while for asymmetric collision, the separation/atta​chment point advances in the direction of the larger wave. The velocity field before and after collision peak causes a net displacement of water particles. This net displacement is always in the direction of the outgoing separating waves after the collision. The pathline displacement results from the overshoot of the rundown process, which must be the origin of the formation of trailing secondary waves. This study used the visualization of the velocity-​gradient-​tensor field to analyze the flow behaviors and characteristics​. The velocity-​gradient tensors show that the fluid parcels are stretched vertically prior to reaching the maximum amplitude. After the collision peak, fluid particles are then stretched in the horizontal direction.

The states of Idaho and Washington have funded outreach and mandatory boat inspection stations; in doing so, they have intercepted trailered boats infested with aquatic invasive species, such as zebra and quagga mussels. However, Oregon courts have interpreted Oregon1s constitution to prevent state officials from conducting searches without probable cause by means of mandatory check stations in other contexts, if criminal penalties could result. This raises questions on whether voluntary boat inspections are effective and what actions must be taken to increase the effectiveness of aquatic invasive species prevention programs. Would Oregon1s constitution allow officials to operate mandatory boat inspection stations if no criminal sanctions could result? If so, what is the likely efficacy of mandatory boat inspections if only civil penalties could result? What changes to the constitution, statutes and administrative rules would need to be made to allow mandatory boat inspections for the effective control of invasive species? What combination of mandatory inspections, outreach, and voluntary actions would effectively lessen the threat and spread of aquatic invasive species? This project included three phases of research and outreach on effective combinations of regulatory and voluntary measures to minimize the threat of invasive species movement from contaminated vehicles and boats into, within and out of the state. This report includes the findings from a portion of Phase I of this project. Specifically, telephone interviews were conducted with aquatic invasive species program leads in other western states to research effective regulatory approaches to limit the spread of AIS in locations where those species currently exist (e.g., quagga mussels in Lake Mead) or have a high risk of being invaded.","Debruyckere, Lisa A.",NSGLC-S-13-001,NSGLC-13-07-01,NA,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2013,National Sea Grant Law Center,Regulatory and outreach strategies for aquatic invasive species in Oregon,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

During the summer of 1990, I field checked the portion of the NWI map of Charleston, OR Quadrangle containing the South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve. Using the Cowardin classification, I delineated fresh and saltwater wetlands in the South Slough Reserve and identified wetland plant communities as Cowardin wetland types by field reconnaissance methods. I hypothesized that the NWI would have two kinds of errors: classification errors and delineation errors. A classification error occurs when the Cowardin wetland type is incorrectly designated on the NWI map. A delineation error occurs when the wetland is incorrectly placed on the NWI map, omitted, or included when it was not a wetland. Of the 402.3 ha of wetlands I field checked, 52.4 ha were classified incorrectly and 16.2 ha were delineated incorrectly. On an area-basis the NWI is about 83% accurate in this test case.

Ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (Hflag) were observed to track <5-�m phytoplankton biomass (which contributed on average 42% to the annual total biomass) during the spring, summer and early fall when diatoms were a dominant component to>5-�m phytoplankton. Ciliates were positively correlated with both <5-�m and total phytoplankton biomass between October-March when nanoflagellates dominated the>5-�m phytoplankton assemblage. Seasonal dilution-method grazing experiments showed that microzooplankton utilized 48 to 92% of primary production in the South Slough. Grazing impacts reflected the trophic relationships intimated by the field results between ciliate and phytoplankton biomass, except when heterotrophic dinoflagellates contributed significantly to the microzooplankton and imposed significant grazing impacts on diatom production and biomass. In one dilution experiment, the suppression of autotrophic picoplankton (Apico) net-growth in low dilution treatments was observed to correspond with enhanced net-growth of Hflag. Reduction of large protozoans (i.e., ciliates) by fractionation in a subsequent experiment eliminated these responses in comparison to unfractionated controls. The findings support the hypothesis that omnivory and trophic interactions among microzooplankton can foster non-linear relationships between apparent prey growth and dilution factor that are often reported and attributed to a functional feeding response by a single grazer group. In a second experiment, the net-growth of ciliate biomass and Hflag abundance significantly decreased or increased, respectively, with increasing copepod abundance, but the net-growth of Apico remained unchanged. These findings support the interpretation of the dilution experiment results and provide and explanation for the numerical constancy of natural picoplankton populations and the failure of mesozooplankton manipulations to promote trophic cascade effects on picoplankton abundance in field experiments. It is concluded that microzooplankton are significant grazers of phytoplankton production in the South Slough and like play a key role in energy transfer and the stabilization of food availability for larger organisms in this ecosystem.","Cowlishaw, Richard Joseph",ORESU-Y-02-001,ORESU-Y-02-001,R/ECO-09-PD;R/ECO-12;R/RCF-09-PD,theses/disserta​tions,2002,Oregon Sea Grant,"Microzooplankto​n trophic interactions and their impact on phytoplankton production and community structure in the South Slough arm of Coos Bay, Oregon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the natural sciences, the alternatives center on two ideas: (1) offer an ocean-titled undergraduate degree program (e.g., University of Washington, University of Miami, Texas A&M University Galveston, University of Rhode Island, University of Michigan) or (2) offer only masters and doctoral level degrees (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Oregon State University). Until 1991 the University of Hawaii (UH) system subscribed exclusively to the latter philosophy; the flagship UH-Manoa campus still offers no ocean-titled undergraduate degrees (such as marine biology, oceanography, fisheries, aquaculture, ocean engineering, marine policy, and so on). The UH-Hilo campus now offers a B.A. in marine science. Since 1971 many of the educational needs of UH undergraduates throughout the 10-campus system have been met through the Marine Option Program (MOP). In 1989 programs were introduced for graduate students as well. MOP may serve as a useful, cost effective educational model for other institutions. Responding to student demands for more relevant education in the late 1960s and early 1970s, MOP was conceived and initially implemented through the creativity and perseverance of John Craven (then UH dean of marine programs), Jack Davidson (director, UH Sea Grant College Program), and Barry Hill (a graduate student in tropical agriculture and the first director of MOP, 1971-75). MOP has evolved substantially over the years, never quite fitting any traditional pigeonhole in the university structure, but nevertheless contributing a significant element to the marine education of thousands of UH students. This is accomplished primarily through three vehicles: award of academic certificates, a vigorous experiential education activities program, and academic and career counseling and outreach. After 23 years, MOP currently employs 10 faculty (all but one contribute only part of their time to MOP), two educational specialists, a secretary, and numerous students on four campuses in the UH system (UH-Manoa, UH-Hilo, Maui Community College, Windward Community College).

The chlorophyll a concentration increased similarly in communities incubated with added nitrate or both nitrate and silicic acid, indicating that growth was limited by nitrate availability. Communities that grew in the treatment with added silicic acid and nitrate were more silicified than communities in the treatment with only nitrate added. No difference in community composition was detected between these treatments in three out of four experiments. Isolates of Minutocellus, Cylindrotheca, Thalassiosira, and Odontella were obtained from the microcosm experiment conducted in May 2010 and were maintained in the laboratory in 20 mmol L21 silicic acid.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/6484540_2430_2815444.csv,133,"By affecting the ecological, pecuniary and aesthetic productivity of ecosystems, invasive species (IS) increase production and management costs to business, while straining public agencies' budgets with monitoring, enforcement and management efforts. Understanding invasion pathways or vectors, and identifying costs and benefits of alternative management strategies are critical to public and private decision making in agriculture, natural resource and recreation industries. This study develops an integrated spatial framework to measure IS risk and cost-efficiency of alternative IS management strategies. For a given spatial unit, the framework weighs expected damages, based on measured IS risk, against the cost of alternative management strategies, i.e. spatial cost minimization. The study then applied the spatial cost minimization framework to the case of New Zealand mudsnails, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, (NZMS) in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) using data from a variety of sources. The first stage of the integrated framework is the measurement of NZMS establishment risk, which is estimated as a combination of anthropogenic introduction risk and habitat suitability risk. Since recreational boats are a main vector to disperse NZMS, the normalized boat flows in the PNW states-Idaho, Oregon, and Washington-are used as a proxy for the anthropogenic introduction risk. An environmental niche model then revealed the relationship between environmental features and NZMS presence, i.e. habitat suitability risk. Results suggest that distance, area size, water body concentration, and accessibility are major determinants of PNW recreational boat flows. Environmental characteristics such as elevation, geologic features, precipitation in January, March, and September, as well as the minimum temperature of June, July, and August, and the maximum temperature of June, August, and October are important determinants of PNW's habitat suitability for NZMS. Potential damages arising from NZMS include anglers' utility loss, which is caused by aquatic habitat degradation due to NZMS invasion, and biofouling influence on hydroelectricit​y plants, drinking water treatment plants, and boats. Because NZMS economic damages and related management cost are not yet fully identified in the literature, damages and management cost of zebra mussels serve as proxies for those of NZMS. Expected damages are then derived as the product of NZMS establishment risk from the first stage and potential damages noted above. Statewide management cost information is compiled from a phone survey of PNW invasive species field managers. Statewide and local management strategies are prevention, early detection and rapid response and its follow-up (EDRR plus) and ex-post management without EDRR. Local strategies additionally include boater decontamination and fish hatchery prevention efforts. Finally, the spatial cost minimization problem evaluates expected damages against the cost of each alternative management strategy (statewide and local). Solutions to this minimization problem, i.e. cost-efficient strategies, are derived for individual spatial units in each of the three PNW states. Reflecting uncertainty in the relationship between NZMS impacts and management, the spatial cost minimization is solved under different scenarios: unconstrained, NZMS damages are a fraction of those of zebra mussels, variation in the effectiveness of statewide and local management strategies, a budget constraint, and targeted NZMS risk level constraint. Results show that statewide prevention, local boater decontamination and fish hatchery prevention are the cost-efficient strategies for managing NZMS in the Pacific Northwest in most cases.","Lim, Youngah",ORESU-Y-13-006,ORESU-Y-13-006,R/NIS-19,theses/disserta​tions,2013,Oregon Sea Grant,Cost-efficient management of aquatic invasive species: application to New Zealand mudsnails in the Pacific Northwest,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The number of parasites transmitted and the transmission rate were compared between 2 different exposure durations and also among different water velocities, by means of field exposures. Under laboratory conditions, the number of parasites transmitted and the transmission rates were compared across a broader range of water velocities and also at different water temperatures. Transmission rate was not constant over time as the number of parasites transmitted increased non-linearly between the 2 exposure durations. Transmission was also inversely related to water velocity and there was a threshold to transmission between 0*2-​0*3ms−1. Lastly, transmission rate increased with water temperature up to 18 deg. C then decreased at 23 deg. C. These experiments provide a range of values of transmission that will be incorporated into an epidemiological model to simulate the effectiveness of different management strategies. Additionally, these experiments provided novel information on the effects of environmental conditions (i.e. water velocity and water temperature) on the transmission dynamics between the salmonid host and the actinospore stage.","Ray, R.

Changes in local and climate variables were correlated with 48 years of albacore troll catch per unit effort (CPUE) in 18 latitude/longit​ude cells, using threshold Generalized Additive Mixed Models (tGAMMs). Model terms were included to account for non-stationary and spatially variable effects of the intervening covariates on albacore CPUE. Results indicate that SST had a positive and spatially variable effect on albacore CPUE, with increasingly positive effects to the North, while PDO had an overall negative effect. Although albacore CPUE increased with SST both before and after a threshold year of 1986, such effect geographically shifted north after 1986. This is the first study to demonstrate the non-stationary spatial dynamics of albacore tuna, linked with a major shift of the North Pacific.

The waves in the U.S. Pacific Northwest have been identified as very energetic making this coast potentially suitable for wave energy harvesting. Several efforts to harvest this resource are under way in this region, however no long term, high resolution description of the resource is presently available. Here, the results of a 7 year hindcast are presented at a 30 arc-second resolution using the numerical models WAVEWATCH III and SWAN. The hindcast accuracy was quantified by comparing to measured buoy data yielding linear correlation coefficients w0.90 for the significant wave height. This study describes the alongshore variability of the resource over the continental shelf. The general decline of the wave power with depth is explained by considerations of wave refraction and shoaling. Further, due to wave refraction, areas off the central and southwest Oregon coast are identified that show increased wave power at 50 m of water in comparison with the 250 m value. These areas also show increased temporal variability. In addition, areas with preferentially narrower wave spectra in both frequency and direction are identified off southwest Oregon. Further, general trends in the directionality of the resource indicate a systematic switch in the wave direction with latitude. The seasonality of the resource is also assessed in terms of variability and trends relevant to the planning and deployment of wave energy converters.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/6498710_3486_2816500.csv,198,"Most parasites and their hosts live in a balance within their environment; however a disease outbreak can occur when either the parasite, host, or environment, are perturbed. Myxozoan parasites are associated with a wide variety of cultured and wild fish populations. Most myxozoans are relatively benign to their vertebrate host; however some cause dramatic population level effects on both cultured and wild fish populations. These parasites have a complex life cycle involving a vertebrate host (fish), an invertebrate host (annelid), and two spore stages (actinospore and myxospore). Interactions between these parasites and their hosts can be strongly influenced by environmental factors, most notably by water temperature and water velocity. Given the complex life cycle of myxozoan parasites and the lack of any chemical treatments or preventatives, controlling infections and disease caused by these parasites is challenging, especially for wild populations. The myxozoan Ceratomyxa shasta is endemic to many of the major rivers of the Pacific Northwest and infects all species of Pacific salmon. In the Klamath River, CA, USA, C. shasta infection is associated with decreased returns of adult Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). The goals of this dissertation were to 1) quantify the effect that elevated water temperature has on C. shasta-induced disease severity and mortality rate for both Chinook and coho (O. kitsch) salmon, 2) identify transmission patterns and quantify transmission rates of the actinospore stage to the salmon host, 3) develop an epidemiological model of this host-parasite life cycle and assess the sensitivity of specific parameters that may act as suitable management strategies, and 4) utilize a mixture cure model, an alternative survival analysis method, to quantify the effects water temperature and discharge on the total and rate of C. shasta-induced mortality of both Chinook and coho salmon. I found that, similar to disease progression na�ve salmon species (i.e. from waters where C. shasta is absent), elevated water temperature increases the rate and overall mortality for salmon species from river systems where the parasite is endemic. Elevated water temperatures also increase the transmission rate of the actinospore stage to the salmon host. The transmission rate of the actinospore stage to the salmon host was inversely related to water velocity, and I identified a potential velocity threshold of ~0.3m/sec, above which transmission was greatly reduced. From the epidemiological model I sensitivity analyses and identified that reduction of the myxospore transmission rate from the adult salmon to the polychaete host during the winter may be the most effective management action to reduce C. shasta-related disease in the Klamath River. This action could potentially be achieved by increasing discharge during the winter to minimize contact between the polychaete host and myxospore stage. Lastly, I applied the mixture cure models to quantify how the daily survival rates of Chinook and coho salmon change over time after the fish become infected with C. shasta. Although varied in approach, the output from both of the models presented in this dissertation can be used to guide management and conservation actions for fish populations affected by myxozoan parasites.","Ray, R.

Renowned cartoonist and writer Jan Eliot devoted 16 episodes of her ""Stone Soup"" syndicated comic strip to the story of a young girl, Alix, who releases her pet crayfish, Pinchy, into a stream near her home. Later, through a school activity, Alix learns that her crayfish is considered nonnative-or invasive-and that there are unintended consequences of releasing an invasive species. Through reading the comic strip, students learn some of the biology and ecology of invasive species and discover how humans can be both the cause of and the solution to environmental problems. Using graphic organizers, students will describe what impacts invasive species can have on the environment. After learning about biology through the lens of invasive species, students will then expand their knowledge through a group discussion on how invasive species are spread, and then discuss the role of humans as causes of and possible solutions to problems. Finally, students will have a chance to demonstrate their knowledge of biology through invasive species and demonstrate writing skills and creativity by creating their own comic strips. An alternative assessment is available if creating a comic strip is not possible.","Siemens, Tania;Lam, J.;Chan, S.;Chilton, L.;Adams, J.;Goodrich, D.",ORESU-E-13-005,ORESU-E-13-005,A/ESG-07;A/NIS-18-NSI,educational materials,2013,Oregon Sea Grant,Stone Soup: invasive species cartooning teacher lesson plan,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Females of different age classes may also spawn at different times, with younger females generally releasing their larvae later in the parturition season. These studies have reintroduced an important concept in life history evolution that ties to fisheries management: the potential need to preserve age structure of the spawning stock, not simply biomass. We are investigating the age-specific characteristics of spawning Pacific Ocean perch (POP) Sebastes alutus from the Gulf of Alaska to see if the patterns observed in nearshore rockfishes also occur in this deep water species. In general, we have found support for age-related differences in reproductive characteristics among females although these signals do not appear as strong as that seen for shallow-water species. Our attempt to approximate the timing of parturition for females collected through trawl sampling may have been confounded by an interesting phenomenon - approximately 3% of females examined show evidence of differential development between the two ovarian lobes, suggesting that some fish may release their larvae one ovary at a time. Our research has not found a strong relationship between mother's age and offspring quality in POP, but has revealed differential timing of release that correlates with age, as well as other important aspects of reproductive physiology in this species.

The first two experiments utilized midparent-​offspring regressions to estimate the heritability (h2) of adult oyster body weight and the coheritability (hx,y) between adult midparent body weight and offspring performance, including juvenile average body weight, survival and yield as well as adult survival and yield. In Experiment 1 both parents and offspring were evaluated in an ""upriver"" environment in Yaquina Bay. In Experiment 2 parents were evaluated in a ""downriver"" environment, while offspring were evaluated in an ""upriver"" environment. Experiment 3 contrasted average body weight, survival, and yield of offspring (evaluated upriver) derived from three large sires and three small sires mated to the same five females that were chosen at random (all parents evaluated downriver). In Spring 2002, 12 full-sib families from Experiment 1, 19 families from Experiment 2, and 26 families from Experiment 3 were stocked into lantern nets and suspended in Yaquina Bay. Measurements of yield (kg tier− 1), average body weight (g), and survival (%) were recorded after one and two growing seasons in the field. Heritability estimates for adult body weight at harvest ranged from 0.313 (+/- 0.083) in Experiment 1 to 0.003 (+/- 0.073) in Experiment 2. In Experiment 3, average body weight did not differ between offspring derived from large sires and offspring derived from small sires (P = 0.47). Significant negative coheritability estimates were observed between adult midparent body weight and offspring survival in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Significant negative coheritability estimates between adult midparent body weight and offspring yield were observed in Experiment 2 but not in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, offspring derived from large sires had significantly lower survival and yield than offspring derived from small sires. These results show adult oyster body weight to be heritable but also subject to site-specific adaptation such that selection in the downriver Yaquina Bay environment was ineffective at changing average body weight in the upriver environment. Negative coheritability estimates between performance traits indicate that adult oyster body weight may be a poor indirect measure of oyster yield potential, and that selection solely for increased body weight could lead to a decrease in offspring yield.","Evans, S.;Langdon, C.",ORESU-R-06-021,ORESU-R-06-021,R/SAQ-13-NSI,reprints (peer-reviewed),2006,Oregon Sea Grant,Direct and indirect responses to selection on individual body weight in the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas),NA,NA,"""Aquaculture,"" 261(2):546-555, November 2006.",NA,10.1016/j.aquac​ulture.2006.07.​037,NA,NA

Twenty-four full-sib oyster families were each planted both intertidally and subtidally in Yaquina Bay, Oregon, and Dabob Bay, Washington.

Comparison of the nutritional composition of cultured live prey, such as species of rotifers and Artemia, with that of ""natural"" prey species, such as copepods, indicates possible deficiencies in essential micronutrients that could explain the poor performance of larvae fed on these cultured foods. Enrichment of live prey species by feeding them on artificial diets is difficult due to high leakage losses from microparticles in aqueous suspension. In this study, wax spray beads (WSB) consisting of bees wax, with or without a 5% w/w extract of a synthetic marine phospholipid (mPHL), were evaluated for their potential for delivery of water-soluble micronutrients and the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) to Artemia. The micronutrient mix consisted of amino acids, vitamins and trace minerals and was based on the nutritional composition of copepods. Leaching experiments indicated that nitrogen (N) retention of WSB containing the micronutrient mix rapidly declined in the first 5 to 10 min of suspension in seawater; however, subsequent N losses over a 2 h period occurred at much lower rates, resulting in overall N retention efficiencies of 44% and 24% for WSB prepared with either 100% wax or 95% wax/5% mPHL, respectively. Substantial losses of labile micronutrients, such as vitamin A, vitamin E, astaxanthin, selenium, vitamin C and thiamin, occurred during WSB preparation. Furthermore, production of peroxidation products and losses of astaxanthin were greater with beads containing 5% mPHL compared with beads prepared with 100% bees wax. Artemia ingested and broke down riboflavin-​containing WSB prepared with 100% bees wax and liberated riboflavin was observed in their digestive systems. Artemia fed OTC-containing WSB prepared with 100% bees wax retained OTC after purging their guts of ingested WSB. WSB may be useful in delivering water-soluble substances to Artemia as well as other marine suspension feeders capable of breaking down these beads by mechanical or enzymatic processes. The advantage of using wax as the lipid carrier, compared with phospholipid and triacylglycerol lipid types, is that it is relatively inert and will less likely react with incorporated materials to produce peroxides or result in excessive contributions to the lipid nutrition of the target organism.","Langdon, C.;Nordgreen, A.;Hawkyard, M.;Hamre, K.",ORESU-R-08-020,ORESU-R-08-020,R/SAQ-07,reprints (peer-reviewed),2008,Oregon Sea Grant,"Evaluation of wax spray beads for delivery of low-molecular weight, water-soluble nutrients and antibiotics to artemia",NA,NA,"""Aquaculture,"" 284:151-158, 2008.",NA,10.1016/j.aquac​ulture.2008.07.​032,NA,NA

We further examined the distributions of pigmentation levels among individuals within full-sib families and found high within-family variation in total shell pigmentation that in the majority of families was normally and continuously distributed. However, offspring within two families segregated into phenotypically distinct ""lighter"" and ""darker"" shell groups in a 3:1 ratio (χ2, PN0.766) supporting the hypothesis that a single major gene is segregating in these families with the ""light"" allele being dominant over the ""dark"" allele.

The severe economic burden of these diseases requires seeking new approaches for their control, particularly because phytopathogenic bacteria are often resistant to available treatments. The type II secretion (T2S) system is a key virulence factor used by major groups of phytopathogenic bacteria. The T2S machinery transports many hydrolytic enzymes responsible for degradation of the plant cell wall, thus enabling successful colonization and dissemination of the bacteria in the plant host. The genetic inactivation of the T2S system leads to loss of virulence, which strongly suggests that targeting the T2S could enable new treatments against plant-​pathogenic bacteria. Accordingly, we have designed and optimized an assay to identify small-molecule inhibitors of the T2S system. This assay uses a double parametric output: measurement of bacterial growth and the enzymatic activity of cellulase, which is secreted via the T2S pathway in our model organism Dickeya dadantii.

Seasonal cumulative hypoxia (DO<1.4 mL L^-1) calculations identify two regions, a well-ventilated inner shelf and a midshelf vulnerable to hypoxia (98+/-15 days annually). On tidal timescales, along-shelf diurnal (K1) velocities are intensified over the Bank, 0.08 m s^-1 compared with 0.03 m s^-1 to the north. Interannual variability in the timing of spring and fall transitions, defined using glider-measured continental slope source water temperature, is observed on the midshelf. Interannual source water DO concentrations vary on the order of 0.1 mL L^-1. Each spring and summer, DO decline rates are modulated by physical and biological processes. The net observed decrease is about 30% of the expected draw down due to water-column respiration. Physical processes initiate low-oxygen conditions on the shelf through coastal upwelling and subsequently prevent the system via advection and mixing from reaching the potential anoxic levels anticipated from respiration rates alone.","Adams, K.

The physical model was a 1:50 scale idealization of the town Seaside, Oregon, designed to observe the complex tsunami flow around the macro-roughness such as buildings idealized as impermeable, rectangular blocks. Free surface elevation and velocity time series were measured and analyzed at 31 points along 4 transects. Optical measurements of the leading bore front were used in conjunction with the in-situ velocity and free surface measurements to estimate the time-dependent specific momentum flux at each location. The maximum free surface elevation and specific momentum flux sharply decreased from the shoreline to the landward measurement locations, while the cross-shore velocity slowly decreased linearly. The experimental results show that the maximum specific momentum flux is overestimated by 60 to 260%, if it is calculated using the each maximum values of the free surface elevation and cross-shore velocity. Comparisons show that the numerical model is in good agreement with the physical model at most locations when tuned to a friction factor of 0.005. When the friction factor decreased by a factor of 10 (from 0.01 to 0.001), the average maximum free surface elevation increased 15%, and the average cross-shore velocity and specific momentum flux increased 95 and 208%, respectively. This highlights the importance of comparing velocity in the validation and verification process of numerical models of tsunami inundation.","Park, Hyoungsu;Cox, Daniel T.;Lynett, Patrick J.;Wiebe, Dane M.;Shin, Sungwon",ORESU-R-13-014,ORESU-R-13-014,R/CNH-22,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,Oregon Sea Grant,"Tsunami inundation modeling in constructed environments: A physical and numerical comparison of free-surface elevation, velocity, and momentum flux",NA,NA,"""Coastal Engineering,"" 79:9-21, 2013.",NA,10.1016/j.coast​aleng.2013.04.0​02,NA,NA

We evaluated mate choice and correlates of RS to better understand fitness differences between hatchery-reared and wild-born fish using a previously constructed genetic pedigree of coho salmon (Onchorhynchus kisutch) from the Umpqua River, Oregon. Two years (2005 and 2006) of three wild-spawning mate pair classes were examined: wild x wild (W x W), hatchery x hatchery (H x H), and wild x hatchery (W x H). We found no evidence for mate choice within mate pair classes based on microsatellites linked to the major histocompatibil​ity complex (MHC) and immune-relevant expressed sequence tags. Greater W x W mate pair RS was associated with increased MHC diversity in 2005 and 2006, while greater W x H mate pair RS was correlated to intermediate MHC diversity in 2006.

There were no differences in invasion of the gills indicating that resistance does not occur at the site of entry. In the intestine on day 12, infection intensity and Ig_ cell numbers were higher in susceptible than resistant fish, but histological examination at that timepoint showed more severe inflammation in resistant fish. This suggests a role for the immune response in resistant fish that eliminates some parasites prior to or soon after reaching the intestine. Susceptible fish had a higher IFNg, IL-6 and IL-10 response at day 12, but all died of fatal enteronecrosis by day 25. The greatest fold change in IFNg expression was detected at day 25 in resistant Chinook. In addition, the number of Ig_ cells in resistant Chinook also increased by day 25. By day 90, resistant Chinook had resolved the inflammation, cytokine expression had decreased and Ig_ cell numbers were similar to uninfected controls. Thus, it appears that the susceptible strain was incapable of containing or eliminating C. shasta but resistant fish: 1) reduced infection intensity during early intestinal infection, 2) elicited an effective inflammatory response in the intestine that eliminated C. shasta, 3) resolved the inflammation and recovered from infection.","Bjork, Sarah J.;Zhang, Yong-an;Hurst, Charlene N.;Alonzo-Naveiro, Maria E.;Alexander, Julie D.;Sunyer, J.

Forcing mechanisms due to the presence of surface gravity waves are of interest. As is customary for surf zone studies, dynamics related to wave breaking and associated wave rollers were included. Also considered were the effects of the wave orbital velocities on the bottom and surface boundary layers. The effect of Earth's rotation in the dynamics is included through two mechanisms: (1) the Coriolis-Stokes stress that results from the effect of Earth's rotation on the wave orbital velocities, and (2) the Coriolis terms in the cross-shore and alongshore momentum equations. Model results qualitatively reproduce observed undertow profile shapes inside and just outside of the surf zone, as well as a few surf zone widths offshore and far offshore on the inner shelf. In particular, the results explain the surface-​intensified undertow currents often observed outside the surf zone. The Coriolis-Stokes stress is not active inside the surf zone; but it is an important player, along with the other considered dynamics, in shaping the profiles outside of the surf zone. The model also suggests the presence of an alongshore current outside the surf zone that is generated owing to the effects of the Coriolis terms in the momentum equations. An analysis of the temporal spin-up behavior of the predictions suggest that circulation patterns strongly influenced by Earth's rotation should be observable in the field within a few hours after the onset of wave activity.","Ozkan-Haller, H.

We used hydrodynamic and video data to relate the movement of these bars to the occurrence of wave breaking and the magnitudes of undertow, velocity skewness and acceleration skewness. This analysis indicates that undertow currents generated the first sand bar through offshore-​directed transport.

These processes, in turn, may adversely affect (1) quality of aquatic resources as habitat for amphibians, fish, and invertebrates, (2) costs of treating surface and ground water to meet drinking water standards, and (3) large-scale biogeochemistry​. This study characterized the surface water sources of nitrogen (N) (total, nitrate [NO3−], ammonium [NH4+], and dissolved organic N) and sediment active within 40 subbasins of the Calapooia River Basin in western Oregon in monthly samples over three cropping years. The subbasins included both independent and nested drainages, with wide ranges in tree cover, agricultural practices, slopes, and soils. Sediment and N form concentrations were tested against weather and agricultural practice variables. Subbasin land use ranged from 96% forest to 100% agriculture. Average slopes varied from 1.3% to 18.9%, and surface water quality ranged from 0.5 to 43 mg L-1 (ppm) total N maxima and 29 to 249 mg L-1 suspended sediment maxima. Total N during the winter was positively related to percentage landcover of seven common agricultural crops (nongrass seed summer annuals, established seed crops of perennial ryegrass [Lolium perenne L.], tall fescue [Schedonorus phoenix {Scop.} Holub], orchardgrass [Dactylis glomerata L.], clover [Trifolium spp.], and newly planted stands of perennial ryegrass and clover) and negatively related to cover by trees and one seed crop, Italian (annual) ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum). Results for NO3 − and total N were highly similar. Sediment concentrations were most strongly related to rainfall totals during periods of 4 and 14 days prior to sampling, with smaller effects of soil disturbance. Fourier analysis of total N over time identified four prominent groups of subbasins: those with (1) low, (2) medium, and (3) high impacts of N (up to 2, 8, and 21 mg L-1, respectively) and a strong cyclical signal peaking in December and (4) those with very high impact of N (up to 43 mg L-1) and a weak time series signal. Preponderance of N in streams draining agriculturally dominated subbasins was in the form of the NO3 − ion, implying mineralization of N that had been incorporated within plant tissue following its initial application in the spring as urea-based fertilizer. Since mineralization is driven by seasonal rainfall and temperature patterns, changes in agronomic practices designed to reduce prompt runoff of fertilizer are unlikely to achieve to more than ~24% reduction in N export to streams.","Mueller-​Warrant, G.

Many authors suggest that tidal plume fronts increase energy flow to fish-eating predators by attracting planktivorous fishes to feed on plankton aggregated by the fronts. However, few studies of plume fronts directly examine piscivorous predator response to plume fronts. Our work examined densities of piscivorous seabirds relative to the plume region and plume fronts of the Columbia River, USA. Common murres (Uria aalge) and sooty shearwaters (Puffinus griseus) composed 83% of all birds detected on mesoscale surveys of the Washington and Oregon coasts (June 2003-2006), and 91.3% of all birds detected on fine scale surveys of the plume region less than 40 km from the river mouth (May 2003 and 2006). Mesoscale comparisons showed consistently more predators in the central plume area compared to the surrounding marine area (murres: 10.1-21.5 vs. 3.4-8.2 birds km−2; shearwaters: 24.2-75.1 vs. 11.8-25.9 birds km−2). Fine scale comparisons showed that murre density in 2003 and shearwater density in both 2003 and 2006 were significantly elevated in the tidal plume region composed of the most recently discharged river water. Murres tended to be more abundant on the north face of the plume. In May 2003, more murres and shearwaters were found within 3 km of the front on any given transect, although maximum bird density was not necessarily found in the same location as the front itself. Predator density on a given transect was not correlated with frontal strength in either year. The high bird densities we observed associated with the tidal plume demonstrate that the turbid Columbia River plume does not necessarily provide fish with refuge from visual predators. Bird predation in the plume region may therefore impact early marine survival of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), which must migrate through the tidal plume and plume front to enter the ocean. Because murres and shearwaters eat primarily planktivorous fish such as the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), aggregation of these birds in the plume supports the hypothesis that it is the plume region as a whole, and not just the plume fronts, which enhances trophic transfer to piscivorous predators via planktivorous fishes.","Zamon, Jeannette E.;Phillips, Elizabeth M.;Guy, Troy J.",WASHU-R-13-023,WSG-TA 13-23,A/FP-7,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,Washington Sea Grant,Marine bird aggregations associated with the tidally-driven plume and plume fronts of the Columbia River,NA,NA,"""Deep-Sea Research II,"" published online, doi: 10.1016/j.dsr2.​2013.03.031i, 2013.",NA,10.1016/j.dsr2.​2013.03.031i,NA,NA

Numerical simulations are obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’​s method of splitting tsunami model which includes a source model, subsidence, and calculations of the propagation and inundation flow characteristics​. The damage estimates are based on fragility curves from the literature which relate flow depth with probability of damage for two different structural materials of buildings. Calculations are performed at the parcel level for the inundation hazard without including damage caused by the earthquake itself. Calculations show that the severity of building damage in Seaside is sensitive to the magnitude of the event or degree of slip because the majority of the city is located on low-lying coastal land within the estimated inundation zone.

In upwelling regions, a latitudinal cline in the intensity and persistence of upwelling is thought to affect larval advection and recruitment, thereby regulating the intensity of interactions in adult populations and communities. We tested this hypothesis by determining the monthly cross-shelf abundances of nearshore benthic crustacean larvae throughout development during the peak upwelling season for 7 years in a region of intermittent upwelling and high recruitment (45°N). We tested whether larvae were found farther offshore during upwelling conditions, and we compared their interspecific cross-shelf distributions to previous results from a region of strong, persistent upwelling (38°N). We also compared larval abundances across the 2 upwelling regions for 1 year. Most species were retained nearshore, regardless of intra- and inter-annual variations in the intensity of upwelling. In both upwelling regions, larvae of each species consistently occurred at different distances from the shore. Further, there were no differences in nearshore larval abundance across upwelling regions for all but 1 larval stage of 1 species. Thus, latitudinal variations in the intensity and persistence of upwelling do not appear to affect larval survival, providing further evidence that nearshore processes may be a primary determinant of larval delivery to the rocky intertidal across these regions.","Fisher, Jennifer L.;Peterson, William T.;Morgan, Steven G.",ORESU-R-14-009,ORESU-R-14-009,R/HBT-15,reprints (peer-reviewed),2014,Oregon Sea Grant,Does larval advection explain latitudinal differences in recruitment across upwelling regimes?,NA,NA,"Marine Ecology Progress Series, 503:123-137, April 29, 2014",NA,10.3354/meps107​32,NA,NA

They found greater niche specialization during El Niño and increased niche overlap during La Niña in both the nekton and micronekton diet components, especially in the larger, more offshore predators. However, only the two smaller, more nearshore predators exhibited interannual variation in diet composition.

However, fish reared in a spatially distorted magnetic field failed to distinguish between the experimental fields and were randomly oriented. The non-uniform field in which fish were reared is probably typical of fields that many hatchery fish encounter due to magnetic distortions associated with the infrastructure of aquaculture.

Understanding the relative importance of these factors and how they interact is particularly important for predicting the spread of non-native species and their impact on resident communities. 2. We used a 3-species Lotka–Volterra model parameterized with field and experimental data to understand the potential for continued spread by an introduced, non-native, dune-building beach grass (Ammophila breviligulata) and whether this invasion will result in coexistence or displacement in the resident beach grass communities (native Elymus mollis and introduced, non-native Ammophila arenaria) of the US Pacific Northwest. 3. We also used the model to investigate to what extent different rates of ocean-driven sand supply mediate the outcomes of beach grass species interactions. 4. Our model suggests that A. breviligulata could invade and dominate dunes across the range of sand supply rates observed in the region. We found that sand supply influenced intra- vs. interspecific interactions, the strength of positive and indirect effects among beach grasses and the long-​term abundances of the beach grass species themselves. 5. Of the two non-natives, A. breviligulata is the inferior dune-building species. Thus, our results suggest that further invasions by A. breviligulata could reduce the coastal protection services afforded by tall dunes currently dominated by A. arenaria. 6. Synthesis: In systems with strong environmental forcing and stressful conditions such as coastal dunes, environmentally mediated positive and indirect species interactions can govern invasion success and long-term native–non-​native coexistence. In doing so, these interactions ultimately shape community structure and ecosystem function. Understanding the joint effects of environmental forcing and species interactions on community assembly is particularly important in cases where species introductions can alter ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, which are vulnerable to the effects of climate change.","Zarnetske, Phoebe L.;Gouhier, Tarik C.;Hacker, Sally D.;Seabloom, Eric W.;Bokil, Vrushali A.",ORESU-R-13-020,ORESU-R-13-020,R/CNH-15,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,Oregon Sea Grant,Indirect effects and facilitation among native and non-native species promote invasion success along an environmental stress gradient,NA,NA,"Journal of Ecology, 101:905-915, 2013.",NA,10.1111/1365-​2745.12093,NA,NA

A range of approaches, ranging from simple (e.g., geometric) to complex (e.g., process based) predictive models, have been developed to quantify overtopping and foredune retreat during storms. At present, however, there is no widely accepted approach for assessing the vulnerability of coastal foredunes to erosion and overtopping hazards. Because different coastal regions have distinct storm and geomorphic characteristics​, models need to be assessed and possibly adapted before they can be successfully applied to each unique region. In this study we apply a total water level (TWL) model and three simple foredune erosion models and assess their suitability for U.S. West Coast vulnerability analyses. The erosion models include a geometric model, an equilibrium profile model, and a wave impact model. We discuss the assumptions required to implement each model and force them with hydrodynamic conditions associated with a large-scale laboratory dune erosion experiment and a major winter storm approximately equivalent to the 30 year return period (TWL) event in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The models are each applied with beach and foredune characteristics extracted from airborne topographic LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data collected along the coasts of Oregon and Washington. Sensitivity tests reveal distinct differences in model dependence on beach slope, a critical parameter in determining storm water level elevations and ultimately the extent of foredune retreat. Without detailed, reliable field observations of storm-induced dune erosion from the region, the accuracy of each model is determined using results of the dune erosion experiment. Estimates of both overtopping and erosion extent are normalized by foredune dimensions, enabling comparisons of relative vulnerability between different reaches of coast.","Mull, Jeremy;Ruggiero, Peter",ORESU-R-14-014,ORESU-R-14-014,R/CNH-16,reprints (peer-reviewed),2014,Oregon Sea Grant,Estimating storm-induced dune erosion and overtopping along U.S. West Coast beaches,NA,NA,"Journal of Coastal Research, 30(6), 1173–1187, November 2014.",NA,10.2112/JCOASTR​ES-​D-​13-​00178.1,NA,NA

With the resolved velocity data obtained in the laboratory, the flow fields are analysed in terms of acceleration, vorticity, and velocity-​gradient tensors in addition to the velocity field. The data show that flow acceleration becomes maximum slightly before and after the collision peak, not in accord with the linear theory which predicts the maximum acceleration at the collision peak. Visualized velocity-​gradient-​tensor fields show that fluid parcels are stretched vertically prior to reaching the state of maximum wave amplitude. After the collision peak, fluid parcels are stretched in the horizontal direction. The boundary-​layer evolution based on the vorticity generation and diffusion processes are discussed. It is shown that flow separation occurs at the bed during the collision. The collision creates small dispersive trailing waves.

To develop realistic adaptation strategies, coastal planners need information about coastal change hazards that recognizes the dynamic temporal and spatial scales of beach morphology, the climate controls on coastal change hazards, and the uncertainties surrounding the drivers and impacts of climate change. This study presents a probabilistic approach for quantifying and mapping coastal change hazards that incorporates the uncertainty associated with both climate change and morphological variability. To demonstrate the approach, coastal change hazard zones of arbitrary confidence levels are developed for the Tillamook County (State of Oregon, USA) coastline using a suite of simple models and a range of possible climate futures related to wave climate, sea-level rise projections, and the frequency of major El Niño events. Extreme total water levels are more influenced by wave height variability, whereas the magnitude of erosion is more influenced by sea-level rise scenarios. Morphological variability has a stronger influence on the width of coastal hazard zones than the uncertainty associated with the range of climate change scenarios.","Baron, Heather M.;Ruggiero, Peter;Wood, Nathan J.;Harris, Erica L.;Allan, Jonathan;Komar, Paul D.;Corcoran, Patrick",ORESU-R-15-002,ORESU-R-15-002,R/CNH-16,reprints (peer-reviewed),2015,Oregon Sea Grant,Incorporating climate change and morphological uncertainty into coastal change hazard assessments,NA,NA,"Natural Hazards, 75:2081–2102, February 2015.

DB-SRA projects the biomass trajectories of a stock by means of a catch time series and five parameters: the instantaneous, per annum, rate of natural mortality (M), age at 50% maturity, FMSY/M, BMSY/B0, and the predicted depletion of the stock from its unfished condition. FMSY/M is the rate of fishing mortality associated with the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) divided by the natural mortality rate, and BMSY/B0 is the biomass level associated with the MSY divided by the unfished level of biomass. DB-SRA performs a Monte Carlo simulation where a large number of random parameter draws are made based on the input parameter’s prior distribution. Based on the catch time series, a biomass trajectory is produced to estimate a feasible set of input parameters and an OFL. The run and corresponding set of input parameters are not retained if the biomass trajectory goes below zero. In instances where the input parameter prior distributions are unknown, Dick and MacCall (2011) proposed a set of default values for two life history types (rockfish and flatfish). Although DB-SRA has been evaluated to some extent and is currently being used for management of data-poor species on the U.S. west coast, further evaluation is warranted. Like other fisheries assessment models, DB-SRA makes several assumptions that may have large influence on outputs and have largely gone untested. First, in essence DB-SRA assumes that only mature fish are caught in the fishery; this is rarely true on the U.S. West Coast and elsewhere, particularly for species with substantial recreational catch. Second, most stock assessment methods, including DB-SRA, are applied to large regions (e.g., U.S. west coast), assuming the population dynamics and fishing behavior remain consistent across the entire area. Market demands and habitat, among other factors, can lead to heterogeneity in population dynamics and fishing behavior. For instance, immature fish are often caught in recreational fisheries, but commercial fisheries tend to target larger fish, causing fishing impact to change across regions. I developed a two-region operating model that simulated data to generate input parameter expected values and a catch time series for each region, then conducted a factorial experiment to investigate the effect of four factors on DB-SRA (version 4) results: (1) different positions of the selectivity curve (the relative vulnerability to fishing of each age class) relative to the maturity curve; (2) spatial scale (separate by region versus combined); (3) exploitation history; and (4) life history type (rockfish and flatfish). The position of the selectivity curve influences the accuracy of the OFL estimates from DB-SRA, whereas the exploitation history has little effect. The OFL estimates are overestimated when the selectivity curve is to the right of the maturity curve and underestimated when the selectivity curve is to the left of the maturity curve. DB-SRA produces higher OFL estimates when two regions are used instead of one large region. Dividing the catch data into multiple regions resulted in higher OFL estimates than one combined region when the same input parameters and catch time series were used. An updated production function, for mimicking population dynamics, was implemented in DB-SRA (version 4), creating separate time lags for mortality and production (recruitment and growth). Instead of setting the time lags for mortality and production equal to the age at 50% maturity (version 3), the time lag for mortality has been changed to one year (version 4). Although the version 4 DB-SRA model has been used for fishery management, it has not been formally evaluated against version 3 to understand the impacts of this change on model results. To investigate the two versions, I looked at different positions of the selectivity curve relative to the maturity curve, different exploitation histories, and varying spatial scale for two life history types. The OFL estimates from version 3 of DB-SRA were larger than the OFL estimates from version 4, which is also evident in the biomass trajectories. The biomass trajectories from version 3 are always greater than the respective biomass trajectories from version 4. Although the OFL estimates from version 4 are not always less biased than those from version 3, the estimates from version 4 are always more precautionary and significantly reduce the chances for overestimating the OFL. The identification of factors that influence DB-SRA OFL estimates could demonstrate how DB-SRA can be adjusted to produce less biased OFL estimates in more situations. The change made in the production function between versions 3 and 4 of DB-SRA makes OFL estimates more precautionary; but does not always reduce the bias in the median OFL estimate. The results from this study could provide information to fisheries managers so that DB-SRA could be potentially improved and is applied in appropriate situations.","Owashi, Brandon R.",ORESU-Y-14-001,ORESU-Y-14-001,R/RCF-30,theses/disserta​tions,2014,Oregon Sea Grant,"Evaluating the data-poor fishery stock assessment method, DB-SRA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study of TWLs and the relative weight of its components can assist local communities in mitigating inundation events as well as drive a deeper understanding of potential impacts on ecological processes. Accurate predictions of surge and TWLs benefit from both deterministic and probabilistic methods. This thesis presents two manuscripts which examine wave and surge behavior within a representative Pacific Northwest estuary, Tillamook Bay, for a pair of fundamentally distinct research objectives: a singular, extreme storm event and a long-term climatological impacts study. Both manuscripts utilize a two-way coupled tidal circulation and nearshore wave transformation model (ADCIRC-SWAN) to simulate wave and surge behavior within Tillamook Bay. The first manuscript details a storm hindcast of the Great Coastal Gale of 2007, a series of extra-tropical cyclones which impacted the Washington and Oregon coasts in December 2007. Wind and pressure data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset were used to reproduce meteorological conditions. Non-tidal residuals were extracted at a number of locations of interest, including the tide gauge station, southern Tillamook, the jettied inlet and on open coast, in order to compare and contrast the relative influence of major physical processes to surge levels. From the suite of ADCIRC-SWAN parametric runs, it was found that offshore wave breaking produced an appreciable surge within the bay, even though wave heights quickly attenuate beyond the inlet. Meteorological forcing was the primary generator of complex circulation patterns and a surge in the northern portion of the bay. The model captures the max NTR at the peak of the storm but lacks skill in reproducing non-linear tide-surge interaction. The second manuscript examines changes in inundation patterns within the domain between historical and future climate conditions. Coupled ADCIRC-SWAN is run for two multi-decadal ranges from 1979-1998 and 2041-2060. Relative sea level rise is implemented by adding in 80 cm of water depth. Climate data from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) is used to drive offshore wave modeling, streamflow modeling and the coupled circulation-​wave model. Statistical bias correction of climate variables using NARR as a 'target' is performed first before forcing models.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/9507672_3442_2816456.csv,10,"Larvae of many coastal organisms develop offshore and must migrate to shore to settle. Two mechanisms of migration are proposed for crustacean postlarvae: onshore swimming and transport by internal waves. In the Northeast Pacific, to swim ashore organisms must swim east. Additionally, internal wave transport distance increases when organisms swim in the direction of wave propagation. Thus, larval behavior may strongly influence onshore migration, though few studies have examined larval behavior in situ. Megalopae of the Dungeness crab Metacarcinus magister (formerly Cancer magister) were observed in situ to determine if they orient the direction of their swimming and to determine swimming speed over ground. They were not oriented to the east, rather they swam at the surface in the direction of the current at speeds of ~9.8 cm s−1 which previous work suggests should increase transport distance by internal waves. We tested the influence of these behaviors on transport by deploying a thermistor mooring for 24 d and calculating transport distances for all observed waves. We calculated transport potential for both passive particles and particles that swam with the surface current at speeds ranging from 0 to 10 cm s−1.

This research presents a multimodal evacuation simulation for a near-field tsunami through an agent-based modeling framework. The goals of this research are to investigate how the choice of different modes of transportation (i.e., walking, automobile, and public transit) impacts the estimation of casualties.The city of Seaside, Oregon, was selected as a case study site for this research because it has been identified as having a high risk to the Cascadia subduction zone tsunami (Wood, 2007). The current tsunami evacuation plan for the area calls for horizontal evacuation on foot. Other modes of transportation (i.e., automobile uses, public transit) need to be considered as well to ensure an efficient evacuation. This is an ongoing study to understand the how different modes of transportation impact life safety in the context of the near-field tsunami hazard. For this project, we use an agent-based evacuation model, which considers the milling time, and variation in travels speeds to estimate the loss of life due to the tsunami hazard. We compare the general case of tsunami evacuation with the varying adoption rate of different modes of transportation.

We hypothesized that the surf zone is a semipermeable barrier tothis shoreward migration and that differences in water exchange across the surf zone result in temporal and spatial variation in larval delivery to the shore. We tested the hypotheses that larval delivery 1) should increase with larger waves and 2) should be higher on more dissipative beaches than on more reflective beaches. We found a significant positive correlation between the daily averaged ratio of wave height to wave period (H/T) and daily cyprid settlement at Dike Rock, California and Bastendorff Beach, Oregon, USA. We tested the second hypothesis by comparing populations of barnacles, limpets, and benthic algae on rocks on four more dissipative and six more reflective sandy beaches in northern California and southern Oregon. Newly recruited barnacles and limpets were significantly more abundant at more dissipative than reflective beaches, and the higher abundance was most likely due to differences in settlement rather than post settlement mortality. The density and percent cover of barnacles and the density of limpets were significantly higher at more dissipative beaches. In contrast, the density and percent cover of algae were significantly higher at more reflective beaches. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the surf zone is a semipermeable barrier to the shoreward migration of larvae and that differences in water exchange across the surf zone as function of the beach hydrodynamics result in temporal and spatial variation in larval delivery to the shore.","Shanks, Alan L.;Morgan, Steven G.;MacMahan, Jamie;Reniers, Ad J.H.M.",CASG-R-10-059,NA,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,California Sea Grant,Surf zone physical and morphological regine as determinants of temporal and spatial variation in larval recruitment,NA,NA,"Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 392:140-150, 2010",NA,10.1016/j.jembe​.2010.04.018,NA,NA

Coos County, one of the most economically critical regions of the Oregon Coast, experienced vigorous timber harvest activity in the aftermath of WWII that declined in the last several decades. This period of extractive land use may have drastically altered the sediment supply in the major catchments of the Coos and Millicoma Rivers and lead to variations in sediment flux into the Coos Bay estuary. Accurate sediment flux histories are critical data for deciphering the relative importance of climate and land use factors such as logging and road construction on sediment production. Reduction of root reinforcement following timber harvest increases the likelihood of shallow landsliding and debris flows. In addition, forest roads increase sediment production due to overland flow and entrainment of fine sediments on hydrologically connected roads. Although these processes have been documented in small watersheds, their compounded effect on estuaries and coastal settings has not been well documented. We use Pb-210 activities derived from sediment cores taken at various locations in the Coos Bay estuary to establish temporal variations in sediment accumulation rates (SARs). Our cores will also be analyzed to assess dissolved oxygen and other proxies for ecosystem functioning. By correlating these SARs with quantitative metrics for timber extraction rate such as board feet per year and qualitative evaluations from historical photos, we propose to document the cumulative effect of historic forest practices. The temporal resolution provided by this technique should allow us to link changes in estuarine sedimentation to changes in land use as well as climatic triggers such as storms. The conclusions of this study will add valuable information regarding the ultimate impact of industry on coastal habitats.","Mathabane, Nathan;Roering, Joshua;Gavin, Daniel;Sutherland, David",ORESU-WR-14-003,ORESU-WR-14-003,R/ECO-28,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2014,Oregon Sea Grant,"Impacts of timber harvesting on historic sediment accumulation rates in the Coos Bay estuary, Oregon (poster presentation).",NA,NA,"American Geophysical Union 2014 Fall Meeting, poster presentation, San Francisco, California, December 15-19, 2014",NA,NA,NA,NA

Drift of the magnetic field (i.e. geomagnetic imprinting) uniquely accounted for 23.2% and 44.0% of the variation in migration routes for sockeye and pink salmon, respectively. Ocean circulation (i.e. olfactory imprinting) predicted 6.1% and 0.1% of the variation in sockeye and pink migration routes, respectively. Sea surface temperature (a variable influencing salmon distribution but not navigation, directly) accounted for 13.0% of the variation in sockeye migration but was unrelated to pink migration. These findings suggest that geomagnetic navigation plays an important role in long-​distance homing in salmon and that consideration of navigation mechanisms can aid in the management of migratory fishes by better predicting movement patterns. Finally, given the diversity of animals that use the Earth’s magnetic field for navigation, geomagnetic drift may provide a unifying explanation for spatio-​temporal variation in the movement patterns of many species.","Putman, Nathan F.;Jenkins, Erica S.;Michielsens, Catherine G.

In order to mitigate the potential damages, people have developed engineering models to predict damages to infrastructure. Economic models are also developed to assess disruptions of economic activities and how this disruption transfers to neighboring area, causing indirect impacts. However, the two models do not integrate well due to the availability of the economic data: economic data are typically collected at the county, place level. In an Input-Output (IO) accounting matrix, the highest resolution is zip code level which still does not correspond to the spatial extent of the natural disaster and cannot be used to assess the indirect impact. In this paper, we propose a method that allows us to spatially disaggregate an IO accounting matrix for one jurisdiction into two sub-county regions with an arbitrary geometry assocated with the spatial extent of natural hazards. In this way, we build the connection between the infrastructure damage and econnomic disruption in the area directly hit by the disaster and thus improve the integration between engineering and economic model. Then, we develop an integrated engineering-​economic vulnerability assessment model to evaluate the potential damage from natural hazards both in the area directly hit by the hazard and in the neighboring area that is economically interconnected. Existing studies have been focusing on disasters affecting one or several infrastructures instead of weather events that cover a spatial extent (Rose and Liao 2005; Lian and Haimes 2006; Crowther and Haimes 2010). When a weather induced disasters, past studies have tried to compromise by studying sectors separately (Crowther et al. 2007), or assuming the disaster-​affected regional boundary coincides with jurisdiction boundary (Crowther and Haimes 2010). However, the spatial extent of the direct physical damage from a natural hazard can be irregular in shape. For instance, in the case of a tsunami, the damage can spread over the the coastal landscape and affect numerous sectors simultaneously. Moreover, the damage will not necessarily coincide with jurisdiction boundary at which existing social economic data are collected. The lack of economic transaction data across a spatial boundary defined by a geologic or weather event lies in the core of technical complexity for disaster resilience analysis. Yamano et al. (2007) is the only article that tried to disaggregate an IO model into sub-county regions. In order to get ""economic grid data"" on a spatial resoultion of 500 m2 grids for Jyogo prefecture, Japan, they use only employment data and ""assume that the labor productivity is uniform across the districts in one prefeture for each sector"", which is too strong an assumption and in conflict with the input requirement table in IO Model. In this paper, we address the engineer-​economic integration issue and build a vulnerability assessment tool that enables us to evaluate the potential damage from natural hazards both in the area directly hit by the hazard and in the neighboring area that is economically interconnected. The assessment tool is applied to Clatsop County, a coastal Oregon county, subject to high risk of tsunami. According to Groat (2005), coastal communities from northern California to southern Canada are exposed to a 10-14% chance of a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and a 37% chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the next 50 years. We use the potential extent of tsunami as an example and illustrate how to disaggregate Clatsop County, Oregon into two sub-county regions: inside and outisde of innudation zone. With proprietary data on business location and economic activity, and making standard assumptions about cross-boundary trade, we estimate cross-regional trade without data on economic transactions between the innudation zone and upland and inland territory outside the innundation zone. In the first step, our engineering collaborators estiamte the direct economic damage from a simulated tsunami event using a widely used tsunami model. The engineering model is spatially explicit and can predict the spatial distriubtion of the key physical variables that can predict building damages, including water depths and velocity for all areas within the inundation zone. This generates predictions as shown in Figure 1(a). We then overlay this spatial distribution of physical variables with the spatial distribution of the building structures, which is plotted in Figure 1(b).i Using an engineering tool called ""fragility curves"", we combine the information of the physical forces and the building structure on each taxlot and predict the physical damage using the fragility curves. This generates the probability of damage for each taxlot. We then use this probability to calculate the expected damage in sales on each taxlot. Finally, utilizing the business location data and the North American Industry Classifcation System (NAICS) obtained from the Business Analysis of ESRI,ii we are able to estimate how the damage is distrubed across sectors in the innudation zone.This provides an estimate of the direct damage due to tsunami, but neglects the indirect impact on the businesses outisde the inundation zone who are buying and selling goods and services to the inside of the inundation zone. In the second step, we estimate the indirect damage of tsunami. To do so, we first need to understand how the businesses inside and outside of the inundation zone are interacting with each other. We start with the transaction table for Clastsop County, OR from IMPLAN, using the geocoded dataset including business locations and demographic distribution, we are able to construct a sub-county multi-regional IO model under general assumptions like no-​crosshauling, In our case, the two regions in the multi-regional IO model are irregular in shape. In the exemplary case, the two sub-regions are respectively the inside and outside of the innudation zone in Clatsop County. Then we use the estimated direct economic damage by sector from the first step as a shock on a two-region subcounty IO model to assess the indirect impact of tsunami on the rest of the county economy. The IO model is used because it is still the most commonly used tool in the impact analysis for natural disasters. A prelimnary engineering-​economic analysis of a major tsunami event has been completed with an 11-sector two-region (inside the innundation zone and outsider the innundation zone) IO model for Clatson County. Because the IO model exclude the substitutabilit​y and treat prices as fixed, it is probably a good analysis tool to estimate the immediate impact after the tsunami. But it may not work well as a analysis tool for medium to long term forecasts, because it tends to underestimate the resilience of local economy. The reason is that local businesses will look for find substitutes and adapt to price changes due to shortages after tsunami. We are currently working on an impact analysis using the computable general equilibrium framework first proposed by Rose and Liao (2005). Then we can compare the simulation results from these two approaches. We believe that the method proposed in this paper is quite general and can be easily adapted to other places and for the impact analysis of other natural disasters.","Chen, Yunguang;Chen, Yong;Weber, Bruce;Reimer, Jeff;Park, Hyoungsu;Cox, Daniel;Wiebe, Dane;Corcoran, Patrick",ORESU-WR-14-004,ORESU-WR-14-004,R/CNH-22,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2014,Oregon Sea Grant,An integrated engineering-​economic impact assessment model—an estimation of tsunami impacts on Clatsop County (powerpoint presentation),NA,NA,"AAEA Annual Meeting, Minneapolis, Minnesota, July 27-29, 2014.",NA,NA,NA,NA

To fill this knowledge gap, an online survey was conducted with veterinary care professionals and educational pet owners on the West Coast to first understand the motivations for pet ownership and the environmental desires for their pets and how aware pet owners are of the connections between PPCPs and the environment. Once pet ownership patterns were established, the connection between pet ownership and use and disposal of pet PPCPs was examined.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/9533509_3430_2816444.csv,104,"Funding agencies, specifically the National Science Foundation (NSF), are placing particular emphasis on the societal relevance and broader applications of scientific research, otherwise known as Broader Impacts (BIs). Scientists are required to address the BIs merit review criterion in their research proposals or they will not get funded. However, many scientists perceive the BIs criterion to be confusing and daunting, and developing activities to meet these requirements is often not within their expertise. One way to reach a vast audience and make scientific research more relevant and compelling to the broader public might be through documentary film. This study explores the relationship between film, science communication, and BIs. To address this relationship, this study includes: 1) an analysis of existing interview data on scientists’ perceptions of and experiences with BIs and 2) an in-depth case study of a small sample of scientists, some of whom were filmed conducting research on glacier melting in Greenland. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis related to how the filmmaking process (1) influenced the scientists’ communication of current research and (2) helped the scientists both develop and meet their BIs goals. Findings from this study indicate that being filmed throughout the research process had minimal impact on the scientists’ communication of their work. However, partnering with a filmmaker compelled these scientists to develop clearer and more compelling messages about the societal relevance of their research. This research contributes to the understanding of what might drive scientists to develop BIs goals and engage with filmmakers or education and outreach specialists in order to meet their goals.","Madlener, Saskia D.",ORESU-Y-14-006,ORESU-Y-14-006,A/ESG-07,theses/disserta​tions,2014,Oregon Sea Grant,Communicating oceanographic research through film: the role of film in helping scientists develop and meet their broader impacts goals,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-or-csv/9533556_1306_2814320.csv,193,"This is a case study of the cooperative development of an ocean condition forecasting tool by Oregon commercial fishermen, Oregon State University (OSU) scientists, and OSU student software engineers. Ocean condition forecasting models developed by OSU scientists were used to create an online tool to assist decision-making for fishermen. This tool is loosely based on the NANOOS Visualization System (NVS), a publically available product of the Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing Systems (NANOOS). The new tool was designed using data gathered from Oregon commercial fishermen in semi-structured interviews and group meetings. These interviews and meetings explored the ways that the fishing community uses ocean condition information to inform fishing tactics. Similar interviews with scientists explored why and how the scientific community creates tools like NVS. Interviews were also conducted with the software engineers who built the tool in an attempt to examine the product design process itself. Resulting findings were used to build a prototype tool that matches the capabilities of the scientific and development communities with the needs of the fishing community. This study also gathered observations on fishermen’s, scientists’, and developers’ motives for cooperation in research and product development. Research in the fishing community indicated that fishermen make use of a wide variety of information, and in a diversity of ways. For example, predictions of sea surface temperature were of particular interest to tuna, swordfish, and salmon fishermen, while crabbers placed an emphasis on the speed and direction of ocean currents. There was general interest in wave models, particularly at the entrance to harbors, given the impact of wave action on vessel safety. Fishermen expressed interest in accurate representations of bathymetry, as well as in subsurface currents. Interface issues with the tool were also important. Fishermen stressed that simplicity and intuitive ease-of-use be balanced with richness of information. For example, fishermen expressed a preference for distance to be expressed in nautical miles rather than in the kilometers that are currently the default NVS setting. While they praised NVS for providing them with access to information on a wide variety of ocean conditions, the multiplicity of models available on NVS and the manner in which they were arranged could sometimes be confusing. Fishermen mentioned that they often use tools like NVS at sea, where the dynamic nature of the environment (i.e., on boat in constant motion) raises interface issues generally not present ashore. There was also concern about connectivity for an internet-based tool at sea, distant from internet or cellular connections. This research uncovered important details about the cooperative design process. Fishermen, in particular, expressed mixed feelings about cooperation with the scientific community, especially with respect to the perceived role scientists play in fisheries regulation. Fishermen also stated that the scientific community failed to value fishermen’s knowledge. However, given the non-regulatory nature of this project, fishermen expressed cautious optimism. This research also uncovered practical considerations for cooperation between fishermen and scientists. For example, the best time for meetings and interviews with fishermen was October, November, and early December, during a lull in fishing activity that generally precedes the opening of the winter crab season. Early in the crab season, as well as late spring, were particularly bad times as the fishermen were generally busy. Fishermen’s schedules may be irregular, dependent on fisheries regulations and on ocean conditions that may be highly uncertain. Scientists, by contrast, may have highly inflexible schedules, with numerous commitments booked months into the future. As a result, coordination between these two groups may prove challenging, and require creative thinking to maneuver around. Scientists expressed enthusiasm for using their ocean models to benefit the fishing community, as this demonstrated the applicability of their research to areas outside of academia. In the words of one participating scientist, “You want people to use the research that you’re doing.” The idea of cooperation also met with a favorable response, but the value of middlemen who could intermediate between the communities was stressed. Lack of time was cited as a barrier to direct interaction, as was the perception that end-user interaction was a more appropriate job for social scientists, rather than oceanographers.​ The student software engineers who formed the tool’s product development team also appreciated having a go-between to research the needs of the fishermen, “digest” the field data, and contribute findings to the design process. This freed the product development team to focus on its own strength (writing code), with the intermediary arranging occasional interactions with fishermen or scientists as necessary. However, the design team members did stress that as the new tool developed, direct interaction with fishermen would become more necessary. It may be that as the cooperative product development process continues the role of the intermediary may change. Those who study this in the future may find themselves facilitating and observing direct communication between participating fishermen, scientists, and development team members, rather than acting as the main channel of communication as has thus far been the case. This research has laid the groundwork for continuing development of a useful tool for Oregon’s fishermen. It has also contributed to a mutually beneficial channel of communication between the fishing and scientific communities. Lessons learned about fishermen, scientists, and product designers can inform future iterations of the cooperative design process, as well as provide a basis for cooperation in other areas of research. However, these lessons and new channels of communication are only as valuable as the willingness to follow through with the cooperative development process. If the new tool never gets beyond the proof-​of-​concept stage, it may actually serve to worsen relations between the fishing and academic communities. According to one scientist, “If the project stops here, the fishermen will chalk this up to one more academic ‘teaser’ or failure.” Fishermen, scientists, and development team members have all invested time, energy, and goodwill into this project. All three groups stand to realize that investment if the project succeeds, and to loose it if the project fails. True success in this project arguably means that the cooperative development process will be alive and benefiting the participants when this thesis is gathering dust on a shelf.","Duncan, Colin",ORESU-Y-14-007,ORESU-Y-14-007,A/ESG-07,theses/disserta​tions,2014,Oregon Sea Grant,Cooperative product development between researchers and commercial fishermen to find applications for ocean condition forecasting technology,NA,http://ir.libra​ry.oregonstate.​edu/xmlui/handl​e/1957/52811,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Community fishing associations (CFAs) are a type of program that falls under the LAPP. The MSA emphasizes several eligibility criteria to qualify for this type of program, including being a defined fishing community and having a historical presence in the various fisheries. Many fishing communities meet these criteria, however they have yet to be federally recognized as an organization that can receive a part of the quota allocation. The purpose of this research is to investigate the benefits and obstacles of CFA implementation, further address the question of how to define a fishing community, and to analyze the overall applicability of these types of programs (to ports, fisheries, etc.). Ethnography and participant observation were used to obtain a variety of experiences and perceptions from members of CFAs and others who hold various roles in fishing communities and/or work with the fishing community, financial sectors, and fisheries management agencies. Results indicate the benefits of a CFA include diversifying a portfolio, business training, and sustainability and conservation practices in the various fisheries. Yet they also indicate that CFAs are not applicable to all fisheries, and demonstrate that there are many fears and misunderstandin​gs regarding the applicability. CFAs need a defined community in order to comply with MSA standards, and usually cannot offer enough incentives to make establishing a CFA worthwhile. Lack of funding, confusion in the language of what a CFA is and can offer, accountability, and agency involvement seem to be important factors that can add hesitance to a group of people considering establishing this type of LAPP. More research on, and defined guidelines about CFA creation, implementation, and quota allocation is needed.","Wilson, Erin R.",ORESU-Y-14-008,ORESU-Y-14-008,A/ESG-07,theses/disserta​tions,2014,Oregon Sea Grant,Investigating the benefits and challenges of community fishing associations,NA,http://ir.libra​ry.oregonstate.​edu/xmlui/handl​e/1957/54895,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The occurrence of oxygen depletion and mortality of organisms with limited mobility is well established along the Oregon coast (2002, 2006 hypoxia events), but the extent of the effect on juvenile organisms is not well quantified. Oregon estuaries and nearshore environments are critical nursery grounds for several commercially and ecologically important fish and invertebrate assemblages. When protracted hypoxic conditions occur in these habitats, juveniles may be incapable of seeking areas of higher oxygen, like more mobile and hypoxia-​tolerant adults. Our project seeks to identify and model the cumulative effects of temperature and dissolved oxygen patterns on the growth of recently settled English sole Parophrys vetulus. We conducted three experiments with a range of temperatures (5 – 15°C) and dissolved oxygen parameters (1.5 – 8.0 ml/l) that may be experienced in Oregon nursery habitats. We hypothesized that the interactive effects of DO and temperature would be clearly identifiable: poor growth during warm T/low DO, optimal growth during warm T/high DO; reduced growth during all cold T/DO conditions. Results indicate that there was a T/DO interaction when comparing the first two experiments with similar temperatures. When compared separately however, only DO appeared to have an effect on the overall growth. During the third experiment, we increased the range of temperatures to a higher and lower extreme, and only found an effect of temperature on growth. Furthermore, we will model growth as an indicator of habitat quality. Our team is working to create a predictive model of post-settlement habitat quality that may be used to compare the experimental data to field measurements.","Bancroft, Morgan;Ciannelli, Lorenzo;Ryer, Clifford",ORESU-WR-14-009,ORESU-WR-14-009,R/ECO-25,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2014,Oregon Sea Grant,Hypoxia x temperature: juvenile English sole growth in simulated coastal and estuarine nursery environments (presentation),NA,NA,"9th International Flatfish Symposium, Cle Elum, Washington, November 12, 2014",NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the data collection for the full stock assessment is combined for all three western states, and many nearshore species have not been assessed. Also, the local catch and stock condition information is not incorporated into models in a way that reflects smaller-scale processes important to local fisheries. Data-poor species are inherently at greater risk of overfishing because reliable estimates of population status do not exist. Therefore, it is essential to apply risk assessments to local stocks to determine the susceptibility to overfishing. One technique that incorporates biology and direct and indirect effects of fishing is the Productivity and Susceptibility Assessment (PSA), which aims to provide a biological basis for the vulnerability of a stock to fisheries impacts, scored and plotted along productivity and susceptibility indices. We will apply this technique to assess the vulnerability of Oregon’s nearshore species using biological data for local stocks and information obtained from biologists and fishermen during a series of outreach meetings and online surveys. We will conduct a PSA for selected nearshore species, and identify the appropriate spatial scale to apply the PSA.","Jara, Andrea;Heppell, Selina;Arnold, Linsey;Owashi, Brandon;Piacenza, Susan",ORESU-WR-14-010,ORESU-WR-14-010,R/RCF-30,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2014,Oregon Sea Grant,Assessing the vulnerability of local and regional nearshore species by applying Productivity-​Susceptibility Analysis to data-poor fisheries (poster presentation),NA,NA,"18th Western Groundfish Conference 2014, poster presentation, Victoria, British Columbia, February 10-14, 2014",NA,NA,NA,NA

This study developed a methodological framework to estimate spatially-​explicit industry networks within a jurisdictional region, which provide insights of sector interdependenci​es and leads to an improved economic impact assessment. We applied our framework to estimate the economic impact of a Tsunami event on Clatsop County, Oregon. We first spatially disaggregate the county-level economic network data into two sub-county regions, one of which is spatially aligned with the extent of the potential damage from the Tsunami event. Then, using the derived sub-county regional economic network data, a Multi-regional Input-Output (MRIO) model is built to simulate the both the direct and indirect economic damages to the local economy due to a Tsunami event. Comparing the improved assessment with results from County-level IO model, our method captures the additional interdependenci​es between business service sector inside hazard zone and forestry sector outside of hazard zone within the county, which leads to increased economic impacts after the Tsunami event. In this case study, the information on interdependenci​es between sub-​jurisdictional regions from our model not only improves economic impact estimation, but also helps regional government to identify vulnerable sectors and key economic linkages that affect economic security. Moreover, this spatially-​explicit economic impact assessment framework connects well with the current taxlot-level physical damage estimation by the civil engineers.

They are also among the most critically endangered wild fishes in their native ranges. They are the subjects of numerous studies ranging from practical management and intensive aquaculture production to some of the most important investigations of behavior and genetics of any vertebrates. Those studies have provided a comprehensive background for testing critical hypotheses on life history and evolution at both proximate and ultimate levels. As a result we have detailed models for the effects of single genes on behavior and other aspects of the biology of salmon, including growth, sexual maturation and morphology. The complex life histories of salmon, with dramatic changes between freshwater and marine habitats, extensive migration behavior and extreme diversification of locally adapted populations continue to be productive subjects for studies of the relationships between genetics and behavior.
