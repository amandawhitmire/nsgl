A storm hindcast using the coupled Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) and Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) models was conducted within Tillamook Bay, Oregon, from 28 November to 5 December 2007. ADCIRC computes two-dimensional circulation forced by astronomic tides, streamflow, and storm surge, while SWAN solves the wave action density equations for radiation stresses. Modeled nontidal residuals were compared to observed data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at the Garibaldi, Oregon, tide gauge station. The relative contributions of meteorological forcing, offshore waves, and streamflow to storm tides were next assessed at four locations of interest within and outside the estuary by conducting a set of model runs where each major process was omitted in turn. The dominant mechanism for storm tides in the estuary was offshore wave breaking. Streamflow, locally (in estuary) generated waves, and locally generated surge led to minor variations in storm tides in the estuary.","Cheng, T. K.;Hill, D.

Results suggest that, at the basin scale and over an annual time scale, water quantity is relatively resilient to climate change. Downscaled general circulation model outputs indicate warming temperatures through the century, but similar precipitation totals and timing. Although climate change is likely to significantly reduce snow pack, which will reduce summer stream flow, snowmelt currently makes up less than 20% of the basin’s water budget in any month. In the lowlands, although total urban water demand will increase due to population and income growth, the accompanying expansion of urban areas into previously irrigated farmland mean that consumptive water use in parts of the basin may, in fact, decrease in the 21st century. However, deeper summer drought may become common, particularly at higher elevations. Cascade-sourced stream flows may become less reliable in late summer, and higher elevation soils may become drier. As a fraction of total water available, consumptive use may be higher in the summer in part because of reduced stream flow. The Willamette Basin population will likely more than double, causing urban water consumptive use to exceed summer surface irrigation diversions by the end of the century.","Haggerty, Roy;Bolte, John;Chan, Sam;Conklin, Dave;Jaeger, William;Langpap, Christian;Mote, Phil;Nolin, Anne;Rupp, David;Santelman, Mary;Tullos, Desiree;Turner, Dave;Vache, Kellie;Bigelow, Dan;Cooper, Matt;Cox, Matt;Gleason, Kelly;Moore, Kathleen;Roth, Travis;Schwartz, Cynthia;Sulzman, James;Wright, Maria;Hulse, Dave;Chang, Heejun;Plantinga, Andrew",ORESU-WR-15-002,ORESU-WR-15-002,A/ESG-07,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2015,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,"Moderate, localized water deficit possible in Willamette Basin over 21st century (poster)","NW Scientific Conference, poster presentation, Pasco, Washington, April 1-4, 2015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Research is limited on awareness and what motivates people—and specifically, pet owners, who comprise more than 60% of all households in North America—to make environmentally and socially responsible decisions regarding disposal of their pet and human PPCPs. We conducted an online survey with educational and veterinary pet owners in Washington, Oregon, and California to assess the current use, disposal, and drivers of pet and human PPCPs. Our research reveals that the majority of pet owners do not finish their pet and human PPCPs. Unused PPCPs are primarily disposed of in the garbage, to a lesser degree flushed, and the remaining are stored indefinitely, leading to future disposal issues. The desires to (1) minimize PPCPs in the water and (2) avoid accidental poisonings are the highest-ranked motivations driving proper pet PPCPs stewardship. The highest-rated solutions were more environmentally friendly PPCPs alternatives, easier access to PPCPs collection, and providing disposal information on product labeling.

Consider these impacts: Shoreline armoring (built for coastal defense and erosion control) negatively affects nearshore fish distribution and behavior, alters aquatic communities, and eliminates upland vegetation (Toft et al. 2010).Coastal development also increases water pollution via urban stormwater runoff carrying sediments, nutrients, toxic chemicals, and bacteria (Waycott etal. 2009). While residents are drawn to, and value protecting, the region’s beauty, preserving this beauty requires careful planning efforts that balance development with shoreline protection. What tools can help planners incorporate coastal ecology into effective shoreline planning? How can we modify traditional planning systems designed for nonwaterfront projects to the waterfront? Planning practitioners in the Salish Sea have created, adopted, and applied innovative planning tools that address the impacts of urban waterfront redevelopment on coastal ecosystems, in partnership with (and sometimes driven by) a strong scientific community and an environmentally aware citizenry. In this chapter, using examples from the Salish Sea region, we highlight environmental planning tools used in master planning, site planning, and site design that may be useful to planners in other coastal areas.These tools focus on addressing observed impacts of development, including restoring nearshore (shallow water) ecosystems, restoring connectivity between aquatic and terrestrial habitat, and reducing pollution from urban stormwater runoff.","Faghin, Nicole;Dyson, Karen",WASHU-R-15-001,WSG-CH 15-01,A/ACE-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2015,APA Planners Press,Washington Sea Grant,Harmonizing the natural and built environment on the coast of the Salish Sea (Chapter 14),"Planning the Pacific Northwest, J.

Multiple measures were used to compare the performance of weighted vs. unweighted branch lines set with two bird-scaring lines – hybrid lines with long and short streamers – during daytime and nighttime. The weights used were a novel double-weight configuration. Secondary attacks on baits brought to the surface by white-chinned petrels drove albatross mortality. Regardless of time of day, weighted branch lines with two bird-scaring lines, deployed and maintained with an aerial extent of 100 m, reduced bird attacks by a factor of four, and secondary attacks and seabird mortality by a factor of seven, compared to unweighted branch lines, with little effect on fish catch rates and with no injuries to crew. This combination yielded zero bird mortalities when gear was set at night. We conclude that the simultaneous use of two bird-scaring lines, weighted branch lines and night setting meet our criteria for best-practice seabird bycatch mitigation for the joint-venture fleet targeting tuna and related species in the South African EEZ. To be successful, the aerial extent of bird-scaring lines should be aligned with the distance astern that baited hooks sink beyond the foraging depth of the dominant seabird – in this case white-chinned petrels to a depth near 5m. Given that these measures were successful in one of the most challenging pelagic longline fisheries, they are likely to be widely applicable to pelagic longline fisheries using similar gear.","Melvin, Edward F.;Guy, Troy J.;Read, Lorraine B.",WASHU-R-14-010,NA,A/ACE-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2014,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Best practice seabird bycatch mitigation for pelagic longline fisheries targeting tuna and related species.,"Fisheries Research, 149:5-18, 2014",10.1016/j.fishr​es.2013.07.012,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pretreatment with oxEPA/oxDHA for 12 h prior to BDE 47 exposure prevented BDE 47-mediated depletion of glutathione, and increased expression of antioxidant response genes. oxEPA/oxDHA also reduced the level of reactive oxygen species production by BDE 47.

We took advantage of spatial variability of aqueous [CO2] in estuaries to examine within-estuary variation in biometrics of intertidal eelgrass (Zostera marina) during peak summer production. As expected from the sensitivity of carbonate equilibria to pH, aqueous [CO2] increased along an ocean-to-river gradient in Willapa Bay, WA, USA. The scale of pH variability also changed, reflecting weather-driven upwelling near the ocean, tidal advection near rivers, and reduced diel fluctuation up estuary.Z. marina studied at eight sites in the bay integrated across these different temporal fluctuations in water chemistry to exhibit increased tissue carbon and depleted δ13C up-estuary. However, seagrass production did not change as expected from aqueous [CO2]. Instead, small standing biomass occurred at sites with organic-rich sediments or high wave energy, investment in branching showed trends along the estuarine gradient that changed seasonally, and specific growth rates based on leaf extension did not shift with the estuarine gradient or with standing biomass. These results reinforce that estuarine seagrasses are likely to experience modified mean pH and variability due not only to ocean acidification in the strict sense (anthropogenic CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere) but also from land use, upwelling, and feedbacks from biological processes.

The removal of the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams, initiated in September 2011, induced massive increases in river sediment supply and provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine the geomorphic response of a coastal delta to these increases. Detailed measurements of beach topography and nearshore bathymetry show that ~2.5million m3 of sediment was deposited during the first two years of dam removal, which is ~100 times greater than deposition rates measured prior to dam removal. The majority of the deposit was located in the intertidal and shallow subtidal region immediately offshore of the river mouth and was composed of sand and gravel. Additional areas of deposition include a secondary sandy deposit to the east of the river mouth and a muddy deposit west of the mouth. A comparison with fluvial sediment fluxes suggests that ~70% of the sand and gravel and ~6% of the mud supplied by the river was found in the survey area (within about 2 km of the mouth). A hydrodynamic and sediment transport model, validated with in-situ measurements, shows that tidal currents interacting with the larger relict submarine delta help disperse fine sediment large distances east and west of the river mouth. The model also suggests that waves and currents erode the primary deposit located near the river mouth and transport sandy sediment eastward to form the secondary deposit. Though most of the substrate of the larger relict submarine delta was unchanged during the first two years of dam removal, portions of the seafloor close to the river mouth became finer, modifying habitats for biological communities.

Virus-sized material (i.e., <0.2 μm) from symptomatic tissues that was inoculated into asymptomatic asteroids consistently resulted in SSWD signs whereas animals receiving heat-killed (i.e., control) virus-sized inoculum remained asymptomatic. Viral metagenomic investigations revealed the sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV) as the most likely candidate virus associated with tissues from symptomatic asteroids. Quantification of SSaDV during transmission trials indicated that progression of SSWD paralleled increased SSaDV load. In field surveys, SSaDV loads were more abundant in symptomatic than in asymptomatic asteroids. SSaDV could be detected in plankton, sediments and in nonasteroid echinoderms, providing a possible mechanism for viral spread. SSaDV was detected in museum specimens of asteroids from 1942, suggesting that it has been present on the North American Pacific Coast for at least 72 y.

Biological indicators of GSI effectiveness have received less attention, despite an overarching goal of protecting the health of aquatic species. Here we use the zebrafish (Danio rerio) experimental model to evaluate bioinfiltration as a relatively inexpensive technology for treating runoff from an urban highway with dense motor vehicle traffic. Zebrafish embryos exposed to untreated runoff (48–96 h; six storm events) displayed an array of developmental abnormalities, including delayed hatching, reduced growth, pericardial edema, microphthalmia (small eyes), and reduced swim bladder inflation. Three of the six storms were acutely lethal, and sublethal toxicity was evident across all storms, even when stormwater was diluted by as much as 95% in clean water. As anticipated from exposure to cardiotoxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), untreated runoff also caused heart failure, as indicated by circulatory stasis, pericardial edema, and looping defects. Bioretention treatment dramatically improved stormwater quality and reversed nearly all forms of developmental toxicity.

Many of the behavioral and physiological functional traits that regulate HAB dynamics remain poorly understood. Improved understanding of these traits and innovative technologies to detect HAB cells in situ are important for assessing future bloom scenarios and establishing appropriate HAB mitigation and management strategies. Many HAB-forming species exhibit a dual-stage life history, alternating between pelagic and benthic life stages. Rates of transition between pelagic and benthic habitats can regulate cell dispersal and contribute to the timing and severity of HABs. Yet, life stage transitions are among the least understood aspects of HAB dynamics. The focus of this research was to characterize and quantify behaviors of harmful motile marine algae during life-stage transitions and to assess their influence on pelagic and benthic population distributions. ​ Two HAB species that commonly occur in the Salish Sea, the fish killing raphidophyte, Heterosigma akashiwo, and the toxic dinoflagellate, Alexandrium catenella, were the focus of these studies. A combination of field, laboratory and modeling methods were used to elucidate the role of life-stage transitions in bloom dynamics. The primary objectives were to (1) examine benthic emergence characteristics of naturally occurring cysts of A. catenella (Chapter 2); (2) quantify strain-specific swimming characteristics during life stage transitions of H. akashiwo (Chapters 3 & 4); (3) assess how specific behavioral and physiological traits regulate vertical fluxes and population distributions of H. akashiwo (Chapters 3 & 4); and (4) develop a low cost, field-​deployable sensor to detect and characterize algal benthic emergence in situ (Chapter 5). The research outcomes indicated that important algal physiological and behavioral traits, including cell survivorship during transitions between life stages, internal regulation of benthic emergence rates, transitional swimming behaviors and post-transition specific growth rates, govern vertical distributions of some harmful algae and the timescales over which HABs form and dissipate. These traits were shown to be largely species and strain dependent, resulting in both species- and region-specific benthic emergence and growth strategies. Results demonstrate that behavioral and physiological traits expressed during life-stage transitions play critical roles in regulating distributions of harmful algal populations. Further, in situ detection and monitoring of benthic emergence and other behavioral traits of harmful algae will improve mechanistic understanding of HAB formation and enhance our capacity for successful bloom prediction.","Tobin, Elizabeth D.",WASHU-Y-14-002,WSG-TH 15-02,R/SFA-3,theses/disserta​tions,2014,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Quantification of life-stage transition behaviors in harmful algae and their implications for pelagic and benthic distributions,NA,NA,NA,"PhD dissertation, University of Washington, Seattle",NA,NA

Geoduck aquaculture contributes significantly to the regional economy, but has become controversial because of a range of unresolved questions involving potential biological impacts on marine ecosystems. From 2008 through 2012, the authors used a ‘‘before–after-​control-​impact’’ experimental design, emphasizing spatial scales comparable with those used by geoduck culturists to evaluate the effects of harvesting market-ready geoducks on associated benthic infaunal communities. Infauna were sampled at three different study locations in southern Puget Sound at monthly intervals before, during, and after harvests of clams, and along extralimital transects extending away from the edges of cultured plots to assess the effects of harvest activities in adjacent uncultured habitat. Using multivariate statistical approaches, strong seasonal and spatial signals in patterns of abundance were found, but there was scant evidence of effects on the community structure associated with geoduck harvest disturbances within cultured plots. Likewise, no indications of significant ‘‘spillover’’ effects of harvest on uncultured habitat adjacent to cultured plots were noted. Complementary univariate approaches revealed little evidence of harvest effects on infaunal biodiversity and indications of modest effects on populations of individual infaunal taxa. Of 10 common taxa analyzed, only three showed evidence of reduced densities, although minor, after harvests whereas the remaining seven taxa indicated either neutral responses to harvest disturbances or increased abundance either during or in the months after harvest events. It is suggested that a relatively active natural disturbance regime, including both small-scale and large-scale events that occur with comparable intensity but more frequently than geoduck harvest events in cultured plots, has facilitated assemblage-​level infaunal resistance and resilience to harvest disturbances.","VanBlaricom, Glenn R.;Eccles, Jennifer L.;Olden, Julian D.;McDonald, P.

Structures associated with this nascent aquaculture method are examined to determine whether they affect patterns of use by resident and transient macrofauna. Results are summarized from regular surveys of aquaculture operations and reference beaches in 2009 to 2011 at three sites during three phases of culture: (1) pregear (–geoducks, –structure), (2) gear present (+geoducks, +structures), and (3) postgear (+geoducks, –structures). Resident macroinvertebra​tes (infauna and epifauna) were sampled monthly (in most cases) using coring methods at low tide during all three phases. Differences in community composition between culture plots and reference areas were examined with permutational analysis of variance and homogeneity of multivariate dispersion tests. Scuba and shoreline transect surveys were used to examine habitat use by transient fish and macroinvertebra​tes. Analysis of similarity and complementary nonmetric multidimensiona​l scaling were used to compare differences between species functional groups and habitat type during different aquaculture phases. Results suggest that resident and transient macrofauna respond differently to structures associated with geoduck aquaculture. No consistent differences in the community of resident macrofauna were observed at culture plots or reference areas at the three sites during any year. Conversely, total abundance of transient fish and macroinvertebra​tes were more than two times greater at culture plots than reference areas when aquaculture structures were in place. Community composition differed (analysis of similarity) between culture and reference plots during the gear-present phase, but did not persist to the next farming stage (postgear). Habitat complexity associated with shellfish aquaculture may attract some structure-​associated transient species observed infrequently on reference beaches, and may displace other species that typically occur in areas lacking epibenthic structure. This study provides a first look at the effects of multiple phases of geoduck farming on macrofauna, and has important implications for the management of a rapidly expanding sector of the aquaculture industry.","McDonald, P.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-wa-csv/12871606_591_2817628.csv,7,"Among the challenges facing aquaculture of native species are potential negative effects of gene flow from cultured to wild populations. Estimates of gene flow are based in large part on the capacity for gamete exchange between individuals, and make estimates of reproductive output and timing of gametogenesis in adjacent cultured and wild populations important to assess. Farmed geoducks of known age from each of five year classes and from nearby wild populations were sampled for reproductive development and other morphometric parameters in March, April, and May 2007 from three Puget Sound, Washington, locations. Results indicate that, at all three locations, cultured geoducks began to mature during year 2 and were fully mature by year 3, with males maturing earlier and at a smaller size than females. It was estimated that 50% maturation occurs at 64 mm in shell length. The gender ratio in 2–5–y-old geoducks was male biased relative to the 1:1 sex ratio observed in wild populations (P << 0.05), providing evidence for facultative protandric dioecy. Rates of maturation in cultured populations were synchronous with nearby wild populations. Overall, mean relative fecundity of cultured 3-, 4-, and 5-y-old clams was approximately 25% that of mean wild relative fecundity. These results suggest that reproductive interactions between cultured and wild geoducks can potentially occur through two mechanisms. First, when farmed geoducks are in proximity to wild geoduck aggregations, spawning may be synchronized, with subsequent gametic interaction occurring. Second, planktonic larvae produced from cultured populations may subsequently settle and mature to propagate with wild conspecifics. Interactions between cultured and wild conspecifics are important to assess especially in cases when domestication selection is proceeding via hatchery-based breeding and other approaches.","Vadopalas, Brent;Davis, Jonathan P.;Friedman, Carolyn S.",WASHU-R-15-008,WSG-TA 16-04,A/ACE-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2015,National Shellfisheries Association,Washington Sea Grant,"Maturation, spawning, and fecundity of the farmed Pacific geoduck Panopea generosa in Puget Sound, Washington","Journal of Shellfish Research, 34(1):31-37, 2015",10.2983/035.034​.0106,NA,For reprint see: WASHU-O-15-001,NA,NA

To examine the potential genetic implications of geoduck aquaculture, genetic diversity, and effective number of breeders (Nb), five contiguous year-classes of cultured geoducks were compared with a wild population. The results from five microsatellite loci indicate the cultured year-classes exhibited reduced allelic richness and Nb as well as increased mean pairwise genetic relatedness. However, examination of relationships within year-classes using sibship assignment revealed that many parents contributed progeny to each year-class. The geoducks in each year-class were comprised of 9 to 25 full-sib groups as well as a large number of individuals unrelated to others at the full-sib level. No clear pattern emerged regarding changes in genetic diversity during the 5-y time span of this study. To decrease the genetic risk to wild geoducks, the results suggest that hatcheries should increase the genetic diversity of cultured geoducks by adopting a partial factorial mating scheme, or they should minimize gene flow from cultured to wild populations by culturing sterile triploid geoducks.","Straus, Kristina M.;Vadopalas, Brent;Davis, Jonathan P.;Friedman, Carolyn S.",WASHU-R-15-011,WSG-TA 16-05,A/ACE-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2015,National Shellfisheries Association,Washington Sea Grant,Reduced genetic variation and decreased effective number of breeders in five year-classes of cultured geoducks (Panopea generosa),"Journal of Shellfish Research, 34(1):163-169, 2015",10.2983/035.034​.0120,NA,For reprint see: WASHU-O-15-001,NA,NA

Aquaculture of the species exists in close proximity to native populations, but very little is known about the health of native populations. Baseline information on endosymbiont identification, prevalence, intensity, and geographic distribution are necessary to facilitate management and/or mitigation of potential disease interactions between cultured and natural shellfish stocks. A survey of Pacific geoduck (P. generosa) parasites from three natural populations in Washington state (Totten Inlet, Thorndyke Bay, Freshwater Bay) was conducted in 2008 to 2010. Histopathology of 634 animals was used to explore trends of parasite presence and to identify potential environmental factors (site distribution, collection depth, and season) that influence parasite assemblages. Endosymbionts observed on histological examination included Rickettsia-like organisms (RLOs) in the ctenidia (n ¼ 246); an unidentified metazoan parasite in the siphon epithelium (n ¼ 220); and microsporidia-​like species in the intestine (n ¼ 103), siphonmuscle (n ¼ 28), and ova (a Steinhausia-​like parasite; n ¼ 99). This study reveals the presence of three microsporidia-​like organisms (including Steinhausia-​like parasites) not previously described in geoducks. Assemblages of most parasites showed strong seasonal variations and site-specific distributions throughout the year. The presence of Rickettsia-like organisms may be driven by seasonal elevated temperatures, and was extremely common at Freshwater Bay.

Geoducks occupy deep burrows in soft sediments and can be very long-lived. These and many other attributes continue to fascinate scientists around the world. As a high-value product, fishery and aquaculture activities are increasing to keep up with demand, and geoduck-related industries are generating substantial export revenues in a number of countries worldwide. Scientific studies are necessary for sustainable fisheries and viable aquaculture, and to conserve the ecological value of these fascinating clams. In recent years, the number of publications on geoduck biology, ecology, and fisheries has increased dramatically. This special issue adds considerably to the body of literature on geoducks. Several of the new papers address basic biological topics such as reproduction, phylogenetics, disease, longevity, and larval life history characteristics​, whereas others address population dynamics and growth models, population genetics, and the ecological impacts of geoduck aquaculture. Taken together, the articles in this issue represent the most current information on Panopea spp. available to the scientific community and resource managers, and illustrate the breadth of approaches that, in the best cases, will result in synergies that propel the science forward. We believe the geoduck research community will benefit from the work presented here, not just as a valuable source of information, but also as a conduit for future collaborations to shed more light on the enigmatic and fascinating geoduck.

Analyzing data from Pacific Fisheries Information Network between 1990 and 2010, we show that over 17 million kg of fish and shellfish were kept for personal use. We used general additive models to examine patterns in proportion of personal use versus price for the top 10 species retained over the 20-year period for each of the three population groups: Washington commercial tribal (indigenous) fishing operators, Washington commercial nontribal operators, and California commercial fishing operators. Out of the 26 species-price relationships tested, only one fits the market relationship with statistical significance and the model failed to predict personal use patterns for any of the other species. We conclude that market sensitivity is not a reliable predictor for subsistence behavior. Although a nominal figure in the overall seafood catch, the presence of subsistence practices among 21st century market-based commercial fishing operators reveals a more diverse array of economic systems than previously imagined. We suggest that alternative economies, including subsistence and associated community share systems, function to improve human wellbeing and strengthen community resilience by increasing food security and community food systems, engaging in a quality of life practice, and supporting social networks through seafood gifting and sharing.","Poe, Melissa R.;Levin, Phillip S.;Tolimieri, Nick;Norman, Karma",WASHU-R-15-014,WSG-TA 16-08,A/ACE-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2015,Elsevier,Washington Sea Grant,Subsistence fishing in a 21st century capitalist society: From commodity to gift,"Ecological Economics, 116:241-250, 2015",10.1016/j.ecole​con.2015.05.003​,NA,NA,NA,NA

Translocations of populations to new environments, and changes in their natal environment, provide insights into the factors controlling life history. For example, the trade-off between egg size and egg number is a wellstudied adaptation in fishes, and especially salmon and trout. We used existing and new data on this tradeoff in anadromous sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, and the non-anadromous form of the species (kokanee), to investigate the likely origin of a population of uncertain ancestry, land-locked for a century above an impassable dam. Native kokanee have smaller eggs than do the larger-bodied anadromous sockeye salmon. However, the land-locked population in Lake Sutherland, in the Elwha River system, Washington, USA had much larger eggs for their body size than any other kokanee population, similar only to the land-locked descendants of anadromous sockeye salmon in New Zealand. After evaluating and rejecting a series of competing explanations for the unusually large eggs, we infer that the population was mostly likely of anadromous origin, retaining the ancestral tendency to produce large eggs, despite the sacrifice in fecundity that is necessitated by the limited female energy resources. This study revealed the utility of life history traits for studying the ancestral origins of a population for which molecular genetic tools were not informative.

Subsequently, researchers at Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery, working with academic and government scientists, showed a high correlation between aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) of inflowing seawater and survival of larval groups, clearly linking increased CO2 to hatchery failures. This work led the Pacific Coast Shellfish Growers Association (PCSGA) to instrument shellfish hatcheries and coastal waters, establishing a monitoring network in collaboration with university researchers and the US Integrated Ocean Observing System. Analytical developments, such as the ability to monitor Ωarag in real time, have greatly improved the industry’s understanding of carbonate chemistry and its variability and informed the development of commercial-​scale water treatment systems. These treatment systems have generally proven effective, resulting in billions of additional oyster larvae supplied to Pacific Northwest oyster growers.

However, the typical shoreline homeowner may not have access to information about alternative approaches for addressing specific conditions on his or her property. Washington Sea Grant (WSG), with guidance from the Partnership, conducted research to determine the components necessary for providing technical assistance to shoreline homeowners. This report describes the results of the research and provides a framework for determining what would be included in a comprehensive regional technical assistance program. This program framework can be used by the Partnership, state agencies, or nonprofits in the Puget Sound region to evaluate how to build such a program. The research was based on interviews conducted with 18 individuals; 12 of these individuals are engaged in some aspect of shoreline technical assistance in the Puget Sound region. Two of the interviewees work with programs in Maryland and were included because of the relevance of those programs to providing technical assistance to shoreline homeowners. WSG developed the interview sample using a chain referral method starting with recommendations from the Partnership and WSG staff. Each interviewee was asked to suggest additional interviewees. The interviews posed a series of questions related to areas of service, key people in the process, required knowledge and expertise, and funding requirements. These questions were designed to solicit information about the structure and function of technical assistance programs. Five programs were evaluated in greater depth because of the comprehensive nature of services provided. Interviews for these programs became the primary basis for the findings.

Infaunal bivalves, in particular, are frequently cryptic and difficult to detect; thus, assessing potential impacts on their populations requires suitable, scalable methods for estimating abundance and distribution. In this study, population size of a common benthic bivalve (the geoduck Panopea generosa) is estimated with a Bayesian habitat-based model fit to scuba and tethered camera data in Hood Canal, a fjord basin in Washington state. Densities declined more than two orders of magnitude along a north—south gradient, concomitant with patterns of deepwater dissolved oxygen, and intensity and duration of seasonal hypoxia. Across the basin, geoducks were most abundant in loose, unconsolidated, sand substrate.

The purpose of this research is to examine the connections between sense of place and human well-being for Puget Sound residents in the context of shoreline activities: primarily, though not exclusively, shellfish harvesting. While it is generally agreed that a healthy Puget Sound is central to overall human well-being, there is a lack of understanding about how sense of place influences and is influenced by human actions and human well-being. We chose to investigate these influences through the lens of shellfish harvesting and other shoreline activities, with the hypothesis that people who are active in the shoreline area will have a stronger place attachment. Elucidating sense of place as a domain of human well-being improves understanding of why people support or reject restoration activities, as well as illustrates how and why sense of place could be strengthened in planning and policy. Our hope is that by building a better understanding of the place-based practices, histories, and diverse values that form sense of place for Puget Sound denizens, Puget Sound Partnership will be poised to be in the vanguard of marine socio-​ecological system management by placing human well-being as a central objective. In this study, we use interdisciplina​ry methods from anthropology, human geography, public health, and the decision sciences to assess the interrelated ways that sense of place, shellfish harvesting, and other shoreline activities contribute to human well-being in Puget Sound. We used two main methodological tools to empirically assess the relationships between sense of place, well-being, and activities in the nearshore (i.e. areas near the shore): in-depth semi-structured interviewing; and, data verification and values elicitation workshops. In combination, these methods produced new insights into the multi-​dimensional characteristics of sense of place for diverse communities. Further, they illuminated the differing challenges that various groups face in trying to maintain or restore a desired quality of life in connection with maintaining and restoring the Puget Sound. People foster unique stewardship ethics grounded in place-based practices that are not otherwise acknowledged or reflected in current ecosystem assessment and restoration approaches used in Puget Sound. The integration and examination of more complex measures of sense of place is important precisely because of the role of relational-and practice-based place attachments in developing stewardship and restoration ethics for people.

To better understand foodweb trade-offs, we incorporated both trophic and non-trophic interactions (e.g. habitat facilitation and predator refuge) into a foodweb model of central Puget Sound to predict the effects of an increase in geoduck (Panopea generosa) aquaculture. At a basin scale, the foodweb can support at least 120% increased geoduck aquaculture, above current production levels (landings of 10 546 kg in 2012), with only minor changes in individual species’ biomass and/or metrics of ecosystem resilience. The non-trophic effects of increased geoduck aquaculture, related to the influence of anti-predator structure, had a stronger influence on the foodweb than the trophic role of cultured geoducks as filterfeeders and prey to other species. Increased geoduck culture caused substantial increases in biomass densities of surfperch, nearshore demersal fish, and small crabs, and decreases in seabirds, flatfish, and certain invertebrates (e.g. predatory gastropods and small crustaceans). This study identifies species that should be a priority for additional empirical research and monitoring related to bivalve aquaculture interactions, including demersal fish, small crustaceans, and seabirds. It also provides insights into the benefits and challenges of incorporating habitat-related data into a foodweb model. Understanding these relationships can inform management decisions by clarifying trade-offs in ecosystem functions and services in Puget Sound and facilitates estimation of direct and cumulative effects of bivalve aquaculture at a foodweb scale.","Ferriss, Bridget E.;Reum, Jonathan C.

QNMs are well-suited to data-limited systems and only require information on the sign (+, −, 0) of the interactions between species. We examined qualitative predictions of community responses to 13 different OA scenarios that corresponded to 3 broad categories of hypothesized OA effects: (1) increased primary productivity, (2) reductions in bivalve populations, and (3) enhanced predation interactions between bivalves and their crab and gastropod predators. The cultivated bivalve Manila clam tended to respond negatively across scenarios, while primary producers (phytoplankton and eelgrasses) and Chinook salmon tended to respond positively. Tradeoffs between species were also assessed: Manila clam and Pacific oyster were predicted to decrease and increase, respectively, when direct OA effects were limited to eelgrasses and the reverse occurred when phytoplankton alone was stimulated by OA. We analyzed the QNMs to identify key linkages that influenced the sign outcome of community members and might therefore warrant future quantitative study. QNMs may be particularly relevant to researchers as a simple method for identifying conditions under which the sign response of species to OA, as inferred from single-species OA experiments, will likely hold in the wild. Given data limitations in most systems, QNMs are a practical alternative or complement to data-intensive quantitative ap - proaches and may help accelerate our understanding of the community-wide effects of OA in marine systems.","Reum, Jonathan C.

Adult coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch return each autumn to freshwater spawning habitats throughout western North America. The migration coincides with increasing seasonal rainfall, which in turn increases storm water run-off, particularly in urban watersheds with extensive impervious land cover. Previous field assessments in urban stream networks have shown that adult coho are dying prematurely at high rates (>50%). Despite significant management concerns for the long-term conservation of threatened wild coho populations, a causal role for toxic run-off in the mortality syndrome has not been demonstrated. 2. We exposed otherwise healthy coho spawners to: (i) artificial storm water containing mixtures of metals and petroleum hydrocarbons, at or above concentrations previously measured in urban run-off; (ii) undiluted storm water collected from a high traffic volume urban arterial road (i.e. highway run-off); and (iii) highway run-off that was first pre-treated via bioinfiltration through experimental soil columns to remove pollutants. 3. We find that mixtures of metals and petroleum hydrocarbons – conventional toxic constituents in urban storm water – are not sufficient to cause the spawner mortality syndrome. By contrast, untreated highway run-off collected during nine distinct storm events was universally lethal to adult coho relative to unexposed controls. Lastly, the mortality syndrome was prevented when highway run-off was pretreated by soil infiltration, a conventional green storm water infrastructure technology. 4. Our results are the first direct evidence that: (i) toxic run-off is killing adult coho in urban watersheds, and (ii) inexpensive mitigation measures can improve water quality and promote salmon survival. 5. Synthesis and applications. Coho salmon, an iconic species with exceptional economic and cultural significance, are an ecological sentinel for the harmful effects of untreated urban runoff. Wild coho populations cannot withstand the high rates of mortality that are now regularly occurring in urban spawning habitats. Green storm water infrastructure or similar pollution prevention methods should be incorporated to the maximal extent practicable, at the watershed scale, for all future development and redevelopment projects, particularly those involving transportation infrastructure.","Spromberg, Julann A.;Baldwin, David H.;Damm, Steven E.;McIntyre, Jenifer K.;Huff, Michael;Sloan, Catherine A.;Anulacion, Bernadita F.;Davis, Jay W.;Scholz, Nathaniel L.",WASHU-R-15-021,WSG-TA 15-21,R/RCE-3,reprints (peer-reviewed),2015,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Coho salmon spawner mortality in western US urban watersheds: bioinfiltration prevents lethal storm water impacts,"Journal of Applied Ecology, 53(2): 398-407, 2015",10.1111/1365-​2664.12534,NA,Open Access,NA,NA

Here, we used qualitative network models (QNMs) to examine the potential community effects of increasing bivalve aquaculture in South Puget Sound, a large estuarine system in Washington, United States. QNMs are formalized conceptual models that require only a qualitative understanding of how variables composing a system interact (that is, the sign of interactions: +, –, and 0) and are therefore well-suited to data-limited systems. Specifically, we examined community-​wide responses to scenarios in which bivalve cultivation effort increased for three different bivalve species (Manila clam Venerupis philippinarum, Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and geoduck Panopea generosa). Further, we evaluated community-wide responses to the removal of benthic bivalve predators, a future increase in nutrient loadings, and combinations of these scenarios acting simultaneously. The scenarios enabled identification of potential trade-offs between increased aquaculture and shifts in the abundance of community members and assessment of the possible effects of different management actions. We also analysed the QNM to identify key interactions that influence the sign outcome of community responses to press perturbations, highlighting potential points for management intervention and linkages deserving of more focused quantitative study. QNMs are mathematically robust and highly flexible, but remain underutilized. We suggest that they may serve as valuable tools for supporting ecosystem approaches to aquaculture.","Reum, Jonathan C.

Ocean acidification (OA) has received worldwide attention from researchers, media, and the public as an urgent environmental and economic issue. Increasing amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion, land use change, and other human activities result in increased CO2 being absorbed by the ocean. OA makes it harder for coral, phytoplankton, shellfish, and other marine organisms to build their shells and skeletal structures.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-wa-csv/17376824_1334_2818371.csv,52,"Over the past four decades marine aquaculture has grown rapidly around the world as countries and individual companies seek opportunities to produce more seafood for local consumption and export markets. The increase in global aquaculture production during this time has been dramatic, expanding from less than 5 million metric tons (mmt) in the mid-1970s to 60 mmt in 2010, with aquaculture products now comprising approximately half of all seafood we eat. The global aquaculture industry is expected to continue its expansion, and the purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for stakeholders committed to sustainable marine aquaculture which safeguards the ocean. While demand for seafood continues to increase, harvest fisheries have plateaued. As most wild fish stocks are either fully or overexploited, any significant increase in seafood supply will likely come from aquaculture production. Expansion of freshwater aquaculture may be limited due to competition for available land and water from agriculture and other uses. With technologies and equipment now being developed to withstand harsh ocean environments, there is an increasing interest in coastal and offshore marine aquaculture. Past and current marine aquaculture practices have demonstrated the need for proper siting and management to avoid negative impacts to the marine environment while ensuring optimal growing conditions. Early efforts to develop marine aquaculture did not always give sufficient consideration to potential negative impacts, resulting in environmental effects, such as destruction of marine habitats, introduction of non-native species, eutrophication, and disease outbreaks. In some parts of the world, concerns remain about marine aquaculture practices, such as improper siting or management protocols that continue to pose a risk to marine environments. Coastal managers and communities must balance the risks of marine aquaculture with its benefits including job creation, reducing seafood imports, and enhancing food security. Examples from the U.S. and elsewhere demonstrate that properly sited and managed marine aquaculture operations meet environmental regulatory requirements and can be environmentally sustainable while coexisting with other coastal uses. Modern, effective management tools include models to predict impacts to water quality and benthic environments, standardized monitoring protocols, biosecurity, integrated pest management, vaccines that reduce or eliminate the need to use antibiotics and other therapeutants, consideration of genetic impacts to wild populations, and improved cage systems and fish handling practices to reduce the incidence of escapes. In Maine, Washington, Hawaii, and elsewhere, state and federal agencies have worked with industry to develop permitting and management systems that make the U.S. aquaculture industry one of the most environmentally responsible in the world. When coastal managers are provided appropriate tools, marine aquaculture can produce domestic seafood while providing economic opportunities to coastal communities and maintaining healthy oceans. There is interest in the U.S. Caribbean in establishing a marine aquaculture industry to produce seafood for local and export markets. For example, the company Snapperfarm, Inc. established a cobia cage culture operation off the island of Culebra in Puerto Rico in 2003. Subsequent efforts to obtain a permit to expand were not successful, and the company shifted operations to Panama in 2009. While no marine finfish cage culture operations currently operate in the U.S. Caribbean, potential investors remain interested in the industry once the permitting process is more straightforward​. Given the presence of sensitive coral reef habitats in the area, coastal managers and researchers, including members the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, expressed concern about the environmental risks of marine finfish cage culture in and near coral habitats, and have highlighted the need for comprehensive management strategies to mitigate potential negative impacts. Currently, environmental reviews of marine aquaculture permits in the U.S. Caribbean are addressed on a case-bycase basis. Representatives from the aquaculture industry and coastal managers agree that Best Management Practices (BMPs) for marine cage culture operations would provide a valuable standard reference to assess aquaculture permit applications and refine permit criteria. In 2010, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) convened a workshop in conjunction with the 63rd Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico to begin developing BMPs for marine cage culture operations in the U.S. Caribbean, with emphasis on reducing impacts to coral reef habitats. The workshop participants included managers from federal, state, and territory regulatory agencies, researchers, university professors, representatives from environmental organizations, and the aquaculture industry. The participants included experts in the regulatory processes, coral reef ecology, marine habitat monitoring and assessment, water quality and benthic modeling, and marine aquaculture. The goal of the workshop was to produce an initial list of key elements to include in the BMPs that would reduce potential impacts to coral ecosystems from marine finfish aquaculture (Appendix IV, Table 1) and identify management tools that reduce or eliminate environmental impacts. The outcomes of this workshop formed the basis upon which these BMPs were further developed by teams of experts working together to craft each chapter. Once the chapters were completed and compiled, over 20 expert reviewers, most of whom participated in the workshop, provided input to improve and refine the final BMP report. These BMPs represent guidelines, developed collaboratively by a diverse stakeholder group that can be voluntarily implemented at marine cage culture operations in U.S. territorial waters of the Caribbean. These Best Management Practices will be useful to many stakeholders. Farm owners and operators can apply them to guide siting and farm management practices. Coastal managers and community planners can use this information to make environmentally responsible decisions about the economic opportunities that aquaculture offers. Federal, state, and local regulatory agencies can consider these practices as they develop and implement permitting and monitoring processes for the Caribbean offshore aquaculture industry. These Best Management Practices are a tool for implementing responsible marine cage culture which safeguards and maintains healthy ocean ecosystems.","Creswell, LeRoy",FLSGP-H-14-002,Special Publication Series Number 4,SGEP-15,"handbooks, manuals, guides",2014,NA,Florida Sea Grant,Best management practices for marine cage culture operations in the U.S. Caribbean,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Price, Carol S.;Beck-Stimpert, Jessica",NA

Experiments were carried out in the laboratory using cysts collected from benthic seedbeds to determine if excystment is controlled by internal or environmental factors. The results suggest that the timing of germination is not tightly controlled by an endogenous clock, though there is a suggestion of a cyclical pattern. This was explored using cysts that had been stored under cold (4 8C), anoxic conditions in the dark and then incubated for 6 weeks at constant favorable environmental conditions. Excystment occurred during all months of the year, with variable excystment success ranging from 31–90%. When cysts were isolated directly from freshly collected sediments every month and incubated at the in situ bottom water temperature, a seasonal pattern in excystment was observed that was independent of temperature. This pattern may be consistent with secondary dormancy, an externally modulated pattern that prevents excystment during periods that are not favorable for sustained vegetative growth. However, observation over more annual cycles is required and the duration of the mandatory dormancy period of these cysts must be determined before the seasonality of germination can be fully characterized in Alexandrium from Puget Sound.

Method detection limits ranged from 11 to 125 ng/g dry weight. The described method is suitable for p,p0-DDE, PCBs-138, 153, 180, and 187, and PBDEs-47 and 100; other POPs were below the limit of detection. We applied this method to 126 scat samples collected from Southern Resident killer whales. Scat samples from 22 adult whales also had known POP concentrations ​ in blubber and demonstrated significant correlations (p\0.01) between matrices across target analytes. Overall, the scat toxicant measures matched previously reported patterns from blubber samples of decreased levels in reproductive-​ age females and a decreased p,p0-DDE/PPCB ratio in J-pod. Measuring toxicants in scat samples provides an unprecedented opportunity to noninvasively evaluate contaminant levels in wild cetacean populations; these data have the prospect to provide meaningful information for vital management decisions.","Lundin, Jessica I.;Dills, Russell L.;Ylitalo, Gina M.;Hanson, M.

Studies from the past two decades have shown that much of this sediment is dispersed by episodic wind and wave energy along storm-dominated coasts. In tidally dominated environments, however, different transport styles and deposits may result from persistent tidal dispersal. This study investigates episodic sediment releases generated by dam removal from a SMR in Washington State, in order to evaluate the mechanics of tidally dominated sediment dispersal in an energetic marine environment. The results indicate that asymmetric tidal currents with peak magnitudes of ∼50 to >80 cm/s produce daily sediment export in the direction of the dominant tidal phase (i.e., the semi-diurnal phase with faster currents and longer duration), resulting in dispersal of fluvially derived fine sediment to distal sinks. These effects are observed throughout all seasons in the presence or absence of wave events. During the first two years of dam removal, more than 8 million tonnes of sediment were discharged to the coast. The net result was little to no change in grain size at 10–60 m water depth across >70% of the seabed offshore of the river mouth. Over the remaining ∼2 to 3 km2 of the subaqueous delta, several cm of mud and sand accumulated in a sheltered coastal embayment adjacent to the river mouth. These results demonstrate that SMR discharge events may form patchy, isolated deposits—or even no deposits—along coastlines with strong tidal currents, in contrast to the mid-shelf mud belts formed on storm-dominated shelves. Over longer timescales, knowledge of the erosional capacity of local and regional tidal currents may be key to interpreting the terrestrial event record preserved in (or possibly excluded from) marine SMR deposits","Eidam, E.

Armoring marine shorelines can alter natural processes at multiple spatial andtemporal scales; some, such as starving the beach of sediments by blocking input from upland bluffs maytake decades to become visible, while others such as placement loss of armoring construction are immediate.We quantified a range of geomorphic and biological parameters at paired, nearby armored andunarmored beaches throughout the inland waters of Washington State to test what conditions andparameters are associated with armoring.We gathered identical datasets at a total of 65 pairs of beaches:6 in South Puget Sound, 23 in Central Puget Sound, and 36 pairs North of Puget Sound proper. At thisbroad scale, demonstrating differences attributable to armoring is challenging given the high naturalvariabil​ity in measured parameters among beaches and regions. However, we found that armoring wasconsistently associated with reductions in beach width, riparian vegetation, numbers of accumulatedlogs​, and amounts and types of beach wrack and associated invertebrates. Armoring-​related patterns atlower beach elevations (further vertically from armoring) were progressively harder to detect. For someparameters, such as accumulated logs, there was a distinct threshold in armoring elevation that wasassociated with increased impacts.

At large spatial and temporalscales, armoring much of a sediment drift cell may result in reduction of the finer grain-​sizefractions on beaches, including those used by spawning forage fish.

Performing separate assessments for fished areas and NTMRs leads to improved estimation performance in the absence ofmovement among assessment areas, but can severely overestimate biomass otherwise. Performing a spatial assessment withestimation of movement parameters among areas was found to be the best way to assess a species, even when movementpattern​s were unknown.

Cooperatives commonly share information to avoid bycatch, but only coordinate harvests of target species to a very limited degree.

We therefore use a life table (based on age-structured assessment models) to explore the sensitivity of fishing mortality, spawning biomass, and catch targets to changes in parameters representing growth, mortality, recruitment, and maturation rates for three representative life histories representing long-, medium-, and short-lived species. The elasticity analysis indicates that demographic changes can result in substantial variation in fisheries management targets, but that changes in mortality rates are particularly important for spawning biomass and catch targets while maturity and recruitment compensation are also important for fishing mortality targets.

We evaluated the utility of using redd attributes, fry (age-0) size, and fry density to distinguish the presence of steelhead and Rainbow Trout in the Elwha River, Washington.

Fry density was significantly higher in steelhead spawning reaches than in Rainbow Trout reaches during both survey years (2010 and 2011). Steelhead fry tended to be slightly larger than Rainbow Trout fry but not significantly so in either year. Additionally, otolith microchemical analyses indicated that all fry collected from newly colonized habitat were of steelhead maternal origin, and these fish were intermediate in size to the steelhead and Rainbow Trout fry collected prior to dam removal. Thus, fry size may not effectively differentiate parental origin despite the tendency of anadromous parents to be larger and to spawn earlier than residents.

Thus, approaches that minimize genetic risks should be tested in a comparative framework over multiple generations. Genetic diversity in two captive-reared lines of a species of conservation interest, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), was surveyed across three generations using genome-wide approaches. Genetic divergence from the source population was minimal in an integrated line, which implemented managed gene flow by using only naturally-born adults as captive broodstock, but significant in a segregated line, which bred only captive-origin individuals. Estimates of effective number of breeders revealed that the rapid divergence observed in the latter was largely attributable to genetic drift. Three independent tests for signatures of adaptive divergence also identified temporal change within the segregated line, possibly indicating domestication selection. The results empirically demonstrate that using managed gene flow for propagating a captive-reared population reduces genetic divergence over the short term compared to one that relies solely on captive-origin parents. These findings complement existing studies of captive breeding, which typically focus on a single management strategy and examine the fitness of one or two generations.","Waters, Charles D.;Hard, Jeffrey J.;Brieuc, Marine S.

The forecast model examines the potential effects of different fisheries and aquaculture management policies on managed species in the South Puget Sound Ecosystem over the next 40 years. Our forecasts of future conditions involve simulating three potential future marine productivity regimes: - greater and more variable than that from 1970 to the present, - similar to that from 1970 to the present, - lower but with similar variability to that from 1970 to the present. In order to simulate likely marine production in the future we developed an Ecosim model of South Puget Sound from 1970 to the present in which we used time series of biomass, mortality and/or catches for managed shellfish, finfish, bird and marine mammal to estimate trophic dynamics and annual mean phytoplankton production. The historically estimated bottom-up and top-down dynamics were then used to initialise Ecosim forecast models from the present to 2054 driven by phytoplankton production time series reflective of the three potential marine production regimes. The mass balance models of South Puget Sound in 1970 and 2012 catalogue the changes that have occurred in the biomass of several marine species of biological, cultural and economic significance. Analyses of the mass balance models suggest that the rapid expansion of shellfish aquaculture would not likely have significantly influenced the biomasses of other species. The dynamic historic model reinforces the hypothesis that shellfish aquaculture had significant room to grow between 1970 and 2012 without interfering with the energetic dynamics of wild species in South Puget Sound. Forecast models show that in all scenarios of future marine production there are few, if any, effects on the South Puget Sound ecosystem from maintaining or doubling the production shellfish aquaculture production. In a scenario in which farmed Geoduck production was increased 10 times over that of 2012 small decreases in wild bivalves were observed by 2054. Forecast modelling also suggests that current fisheries and aquaculture policies generally have the effect of allowing for rebuilding biomasses in species that had declined from 1970 to the present. Sea lions appeared to attenuate the rebuilding of biomasses of some finfish in forecasts to 2054. However scenarios modelled with mandated reduction in Sea Lion biomasses showed significant rebuilding of rockfish, salmon and gadids.","Preikshot, Dave;Hudson, Bobbi;Cheney, Dan",WASHU-T-15-006,WSG-TR 15-11,NA,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2015,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Ecosystem models of species changes in South Puget Sound from 1970 to 2012 and simulations of species changes from 2012 to 2054,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We present a proof of concept design for a home reconstruction discrete-event simulation (DES) to evaluate its potential for simulating disaster recovery in general. The design is implemented as a prototype using the SimPy discrete-event simulation Python library. Preliminary outputs from the prototype simulation suggest that DES is appropriate and promising for modeling home reconstruction. The ability to alter the quantities of shared resource stocks, event durations, and access qualifications can likely facilitate modeling of other types of recovery processes, as well as a variety of post-disaster scenarios.

Despite this, most stock assessments either fix or estimate a time-invariant growth relationship because estimating time-varying growth parameters can be data intensive and subject to multiple sources of bias. Additionally, estimates of growth are often confounded with estimates of selectivity, particularly if selectivity is also time varying. Incorporating empirical weight-at-age (EWAA) information into assessments is a little-studied alternative that accounts for time-varying growth, but foregoes fixing or estimating growth and length–weight relationships. However, this method requires annual measures of fish weights at each age, and missing values must therefore be interpolated. We used Stock Synthesis in a simulation-​testing framework to compare the effect of estimating a single time-invariant growth curve, time-varying growth curves, and incorporating EWAA information on management quantities and parameter estimates. We ran simulations across two fish life histories (hake-like and rockfish-like) and three data cases (data-rich, data-rich with a late-starting survey, and data-moderate). We found that when growth was time invariant, the EWAA approach was unbiased but had twice the median average relative error compared to a model that estimated growth from age and length data. However, for data-rich cases with time-varying growth, the EWAA method resulted in more accurate estimates of spawning stock biomass compared to the approach that estimated time-invariant and time-varying growth parameters, as evidenced by at least a five-fold reduction in range of median relative errors. The magnitude of this effect was greatest for the long-lived, slow-growing life history. For the relatively fast-growing species, estimates from the EWAA method were particularly sensitive to interpolating missing values.","Kuriyama, Peter T.;Ono, Kitaro;Hurtado-​Ferro, Felipe;Hicks, Allan C.;Taylor, Ian G.;Licandeo, Roberto R.;Johnson, Kelli F.;Anderson, Sean C.;Monnahan, Cole C.;Budd, Merrill B.;Stawitz, Christine C.;Valero, Juan L.",WASHU-R-16-006,WSG-TA 15-46,R/COCC/SS-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2016,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"An empirical weight-at-age approach reduces estimation bias compared to modeling parametric growth in integrated, statistical stock assessment models when growth is time varying",", 180:119-127, 2016;Fisheries Research, Available online doi: 10.1016/j.fishr​es.2015.09.007,​ September 28, 2015",10.1016/j.fishr​es.2015.09.007,NA,NA,NA,NA

Furthermore, some modeling frameworks also allow users to specify a distinct structure for how lengths of fish are represented in the model (model bins). The effect of choices regarding the number and width of these bins on model output is unclear, and these choices are made inconsistently in assessments across regions and species. Here, we used the stock synthesis modeling framework, and the ss3sim stock assessment simulation package, to explore the effects of choices about length discretization on stock assessment performance for three fish life-history types and four data cases. We found that, with all other aspects of a model fixed, increasing the model bin width tended to increase estimates of spawning biomass, but this effect depended on the shape of length-based processes (e.g., growth, maturity, and selectivity). Thus, we suggest analysts using model bins wider than 1 cm explore the effect of this decision on derived management quantities. In the context of estimation, there generally was a predictable tradeoff between estimation accuracy and model run time, with finer model and data bins always improving estimation accuracy and model convergence, but increasing run time. In some cases, wider data bins reduced run time (by up to 50%) with little sacrifice in model estimation performance, particularly those using conditional age-at-length data.

For both species, strays colonized immediately but decreased as a proportion of the total run over time. Chinook salmon strays were more numerous in years when the species was more abundant below the dam and included a much larger proportion of hatchery origin salmon than did coho salmon. Productivity, calculated as the ratio of female recruits sampled at the dam to female spawners, exceeded replacement in all four coho salmon cohorts but only two of five Chinook salmon cohorts, leading to more rapid population expansion of coho salmon. However, estimates of fishing mortality and recruitment into the Cedar River below the dam substantially increased Chinook salmon productivity estimates. Our results demonstrate that Pacific salmon are capable of rapidly recolonizing habitat made accessible by restoration and emphasize the importance of demographic exchange with preexisting populations during the transition from recolonization to self-​sustainability.","Anderson, Joseph H.;Fauldsm Paul L.;Burton, Karl D.;Koehler, Michele E.;Atlas, William I.;Quinn, Thomas P.",WASHU-R-15-038,WSG-TA 15-49,R/HCE-9 - R/LME-7,reprints (peer-reviewed),2015,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Dispersal and productivity of Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon colonizing newly accessible habitat,"Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 72:454-465, 2015",10.1139/cjfas-​2014-​0180,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used a combination of DNA-based parentage analysis and mark–recapture techniques to evaluate dispersal by juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in a population in the initial stages of colonisation following installation of fish passage structures at a previously impassable dam on the Cedar River, WA, USA. The spatial distribution of individuals within maternal families revealed that dispersal was common. Among the offspring of radio-tagged mothers, 28% were collected outside the spawning reach and dispersed up to 6.3 km (median = 1.5 km). Most juveniles captured in a tributary (Rock Creek, where few adults spawned) had immigrated from the Cedar River and represented many different families. Juvenile dispersal therefore provided a secondary phase of spatial expansion following initial colonisation by adults. Consistent with the condition-​dependent dispersal hypothesis, juveniles that dispersed farther upstream in the tributary were larger than fish collected near the tributary mouth. Overall, the results demonstrated widespread dispersal in a system with low coho salmon densities, and this might increase the rate of population growth if it reduces the effects of local density dependence. By implication, juveniles can take advantage of rearing habitats reconnected through barrier removal, even when such areas are located several kilometres from adult breeding grounds.","Anderson, Joseph H.;Pess, George R.;Kiffney Peter M.;Bennett, Todd R.;Faulds, Paul L.;Atlas William I.;Quinn, Thomas P.",WASHU-R-13-013,WSG-TA 15-49,R/HCE-9 - R/LME-7,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Dispersal and tributary immigration by juvenile coho salmon contribute to spatial expansion during colonisation,"Ecology of Freshwater Fish 22:30-42, 2013",10.1111/j.1600-​0633.2012.00589​.x,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of the case studies is to document and share lessons learned from examples of marine spatial planning in the U.S. in order to build the capacity of MSP and coastal management practitioners. Research was conducted in three locations: Rhode Island, Washington State and San Francisco. The Rhode Island case focused on implementation of the Rhode Island Ocean Special Area Management Plan; the Washington case focused on the ongoing development of the Washington Coast Marine Spatial Plan; and the San Francisco study became a two‐case analysis of two different Coast Guard‐led waterways management initiatives. CRC has produced three technical reports summarizing case study research as well as a series of shorter publications highlighting key findings. The Rhode Island Ocean Special Area Management Plan (Ocean SAMP), a marine spatial plan — and, one of the United States’ first such plans — laid the groundwork for the siting and permitting of the nation’s first offshore wind farm. This document examines the Ocean SAMP process from the time it was conceived, through its intensive plan development period (2008 – 2010) and its five years of implementation to date (2010‐2015). The focus, however, is on examining the implementation phase, as this is the period that has yet to be studied. Drawing on the field‐tested experience of planners, managers, and stakeholders interviewed for this study, the case offers lessons learned through this intensive marine spatial planning (MSP) process. These lessons emphasize the importance of: building a broad base of leadership; allowing time to build trust; using the planning driver to maintain stakeholder engagement through plan implementation; including clear policy tools in the plan to facilitate streamlined decision‐making​; and preparing to work even harder during implementation than in the design and development phases. This case study tells two stories. First is that of preparing a marine spatial plan for an area shaped by numerous interests and resources important to Rhode Islanders: commercial and recreational fishing, commercial shipping, recreational boating and sailing, marine resources and habitats, and potentially offshore wind energy development. Second is that of locating and permitting the United States’ first offshore wind energy project. The coast of the northeastern United States has premier wind resources, and renewable energy development is arguably a priority to both the nation and to the state of Rhode Island. The two stories are interwoven, as that is how they have taken place. Yet, it is important to emphasize that the Ocean SAMP was launched, prepared and adopted as a comprehensive ecosystem‐based​ marine spatial plan, not as a renewable energy facility siting plan.","Schumann, Sarah;Smythe, Tiffany;Andrescavage, Nicole;Fox, Christian",RIU-T-16-001,P2198,NA,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2016,NA,Rhode Island Sea Grant,"The Rhode Island Ocean Special Area Management Plan, 2008-2015: From inception through implementation",NA,NA,NA,Case Studies of Marine Spatial Planning Report Series,"McCann, Jennifer",NA

CRC has produced three technical reports summarizing case study research as well as a series of shorter publications highlighting key findings. The Washington State Pacific coast has a long history of its people making a living from its natural resources. Home to four coastal Treaty Tribes as well as communities that make a living from fishing, tourism, and logging, the people from this region have traditionally played a leadership role in the management of their coasts and offshore waters in partnership with state and federal government. Using tools, including community‐devel​oped shoreline management plans, national and state marine conservation areas, and formal agreements between government (including Tribes) and user groups, the people of this region have worked to protect the natural resources upon which they so greatly depend, while managing increased human activities. The most recent coastal management tool brought to this region is marine spatial planning (MSP). This began with the approval of a state law in 2010 that required the creation of regional non‐regulatory marine spatial plans: “The state intends to augment the marine spatial component of existing plans and to improve the coordination among state agencies in the development and implementation of marine management plans.”1 Spearheaded by a state Senator, this law was established with support from local individuals concerned about the impact offshore renewable energy would have on their fishing activity. The first area for which a marine spatial plan is being completed is the Washington Pacific coast region (see Figure 1). Through the public scoping process, it was determined that the Washington Coast marine spatial plan would have the goal of ensuring “a resilient and healthy marine ecosystem on Washington’s coast that supports sustainable economic, recreational, and cultural opportunities for coastal communities, visitors, and future generations.”2 ​ While the plan is not expected to be completed until the end of 2016, this case study communicates the story to date and presents observations and lessons learned that may be helpful to other coastal management practitioners. Key lessons learned identified through this study are these: the value of understanding the historical context of your place before you begin a plan, the need to manage expectations, and the need to adapt if the issues driving the MSP process cease to be relevant to stakeholders.","Trosin, Bridget;Smythe, Tiffany;McCann, Jennifer;Fox, Christian;Andrescavage, Nicole",RIU-T-16-003,P2205,NA,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2016,NA,Rhode Island Sea Grant,"A case study of the Washington coast marine spatial planning process, 2010-2015",NA,NA,NA,Case Studies of Marine Spatial Planning Report Series,"McCann, Jennifer",NA

These areas of interest basically followed those that previously had been presented in Sea Grant's Strategic Plan 1995-2005 (Apri11995 draft) and subsequently were published as the Sea Grant Network Plan 1995-2005 (see outline summary on pp. x-xi). Each subcommittee was then asked to submit its recommendations​ to the Strategic Plan Implementation Committee for integration into a single document. After considerable discussion, the committee decided that it would be impractical to write an implementation plan for the entire network, particularly one based on its discussions and documents from the Puerto Rico meeting. To effectively represent all Sea Grant programs, such a document would have to be very broad in its coverage; a resulting plan would also most likely be of limited value to everyone. We also felt that it was presumptuous for the committee to prescribe implementation elements that were very important to a particular program, yet of only local or regional interest. Such plans are best developed either at the individual pro gram level, or regionally. The committee did feel strongly, however, that it would be desirable for every program to develop an implementation plan. We also felt that a reasonably uniform approach by all programs, as well as for the NSGO, would be desirable. These implementation plans are meant to serve as a management tool for each program, as a means of planning cooperative ventures among programs and as a framework for the NSGO to assist in the coordination of activities among the national programs. Furthermore, the NSGO could then use these plans, together with the research subcommittee in the new Sea Grant Association structure, to develop new initiatives. With these caveats in mind, the committee developed a set of guiding principles and an implementation plan outline that provides a framework for each pro gram to use in its planning activities.

Conceptual models are valuable tools for assimilating and simplifying this information to convey our understanding of ecosystem structure and functioning. Qualitative network models (QNMs) may allow us to conduct dynamic simulations of conceptual models to explore natural–social relationships, compare management strategies, and identify tradeoffs. We used previously developed QNM methods to perform simulations based on conceptual models of the California Current ecosystem’s pelagic communities and related human activities and values. Assumptions about community structure and trophic interactions influenced the outcomes of the QNMs. In simulations where we applied unfavorable environmental conditions for production of salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), intensive management actions only modestly mitigated declines experienced by salmon, but strongly constrained human activities. Moreover, the management actions had little effect on a human wellbeing attribute, sense of place.

Previtellogenic​, two-year old coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were subjected to prolonged fasting to induce atresia or maintained on a normal feeding schedule that would promote continued ovarian development. To identify genes that were specifically up- or downregulated during oocyte growth in healthy, growing fish compared to fasted fish, reciprocal suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA librarieswere generated using ovaries fromfed and fasted animals. Differential expression of genes identified by SSH was confirmed with quantitative PCR. The SSH library representing genes elevated in ovaries of fed fish relative to those of fasted fish contained steroidogenesis-​related genes (e.g., hydroxy-​delta-​5-​steroid dehydrogenase), Tgf-beta superfamily members (e.g., anti-Mullerian hormone) and cytoskeletal intermediate filament proteins (e.g., type I keratin s8). Overall, these geneswere associatedwith steroid production, cell proliferation and differentiation​, and ovarian epithelializati​on. The library representing genes elevated in ovaries of fasted fish relative to fed fish contained genes associated with apoptosis (e.g., programmed cell death protein 4), cortical alveoli (e.g., alveolin), the zona pellucida (e.g., zona pellucida protein c), and microtubules (e.g., microtubule associated protein tau). Elevated expression of this suite of genes was likely associated with the initiation of atresia and/or a reduced rate of follicle development in response to fasting.

As a result, studies have focused on the effects of EDC exposure on the gonad and liver. However, impacts of environmental EDC exposure at higher levels of the hypothalamic-​pituitary-​gonad axis are less well understood. The pituitary gonadotropins, follicle-​stimulating hormone (Fsh) and luteinizing hormone (Lh) are involved in all aspects of gonad development and are subject to feedback from gonadal steroids making them a likely target of endocrine disruption. In this study, the effects of WWTP effluent exposure on pituitary gonadotropin mRNA expression were investigated to assess the utility of Lh beta-subunit (lhb) as a biomarker of estrogen exposure in juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). First, a controlled 72-h exposure to 17α-​ethynylestradio​l (EE2) and 17β-trenbolone (TREN) was performed to evaluate the response of juvenile coho salmon to EDC exposure. Second, juvenile coho salmon were exposed to 0, 20 or 100% effluent from eight WWTPs from the Puget Sound, WA region for 72 h. Juvenile coho salmon exposed to 2 and 10 ng EE2 L−1 had 17-fold and 215-fold higher lhb mRNA levels relative to control fish. Hepatic vtg mRNA levels were dramatically increased 6670-fold, but only in response to 10 ng EE2 L−1 and Fsh beta-subunit (fshb) mRNA levels were not altered by any of the treatments. In the WWTP effluent exposures, lhb mRNA levels were significantly elevated in fish exposed to five of the WWTP effluents. In contrast, transcript levels of vtg were not affected by any of the WWTP effluent exposures. Mean levels of natural and synthetic estrogens in fish bile were consistent with pituitary lhb expression, suggesting that the observed lhb induction may be due to estrogenic activity of the WWTP effluents. These results suggest that lhb gene expression may be a sensitive index of acute exposure to estrogenic chemicals in juvenile coho salmon. Further work is needed to determine the kinetics and specificity of lhb induction to evaluate its utility as a potential indicator of estrogen exposure in immature fish.","Harding, Louisa B.;Schultz, Irvin R.;da Silva, Dennis A.

A challenge is to translate social science expertise regarding these relationships into terms usable by environmental scientists, policymakers, and managers. Here, we present a comprehensive, structured, and transparent conceptual framework of human wellbeing designed to guide the development of indicators and a complementary social science research agenda for ecosystem-based management. Our framework grew out of an effort to develop social indicators for an integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA) of the California Current large marine ecosystem. Drawing from scholarship in international development, anthropology, geography, and political science, we define human wellbeing as a state of being with others and the environment, which arises when human needs are met, when individuals and communities can act meaningfully to pursue their goals, and when individuals and communities enjoy a satisfactory quality of life. We propose four major social science-based constituents of wellbeing: connections, capabilities, conditions, and cross-cutting domains. The latter includes the domains of equity and justice, security, resilience, and sustainability, which may be assessed through cross-cutting analyses of other constituents. We outline a process for identifying policy-relevant attributes of wellbeing that can guide ecosystem assessments. To operationalize the framework, we provide a detailed table of attributes and a large database of available indicators, which may be used to develop measures suited to a variety of management needs and social goals.

In the marine environment, estimates of connectivity often rely on the use of genetic markers, as dispersal primarily occurs during a planktonic larval phase which is difficult to track using direct methods. In this thesis, we investigated the population genetic structure of the most valuable commercially harvested species on the west coast of the United States, the Dungeness crab (Cancer magister). We utilized both population- and individual-​based genetic analyses to establish baseline knowledge of genetic connectivity of Dungeness crab throughout ~1,200 km of the California Current System (CCS) in 2012, and tested for inter-annual variability in our estimates by sampling again in 2014. In 2012, we observed a pattern of isolation by distance despite there being little genetic population structure throughout our study range. In addition, several sites had significant evidence of kin aggregation, which was correlated with genetic differentiation as measured by pairwise FST. In 2014, pairwise FST estimates were noticeably lower, there was no spatial autocorrelation​, and fewer sights had significant evidence of kin aggregation. We attributed these findings to increased migrant exchange during potential larval dispersal years, which was mediated by variation in physical oceanographic conditions (i.e. Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase, timing of the spring transition, amount of upwelling during the spring and summer). Dispersal trajectory, and thus gene flow, is likely influenced by variation in physical oceanographic conditions, thereby affecting genetic population structure. Estimates of effective population size (NE) indicated that NE was large in both 2012 and 2014, but we were unable to discern any change between years. Together, these findings suggest that Dungeness crab in the CCS may constitute a single evolutionary population, though geographically limited dispersal results in isolation by distance. We also evaluated genetic connectivity among Dungeness crab inhabiting a partially enclosed water body, Puget Sound, in comparison to those residing in the coastal ocean. With the exception of Hood Canal, we observed genetic homogeneity within both Puget Sound and coastal Washington. Genetic differentiation between Puget Sound and coastal Washington was variable among sites, therefore genetic connectivity is stronger within either area than between them. Overall, our results suggest that Dungeness crab exemplify characteristics of a ‘high gene flow’ species, despite evidence supporting geographically limited gene flow. Our findings did not indicate that altering the management strategy to reflect discrete genetic subunits or conversation needs (i.e. low genetic diversity) is necessary at this time. In addition, our findings highlight the need for future research to investigate demographic processes that influence gene flow (i.e. dispersal trajectory).","Jackson, Tyler M.",ORESU-Y-16-006,ORESU-Y-16-006,R/RCF-33,theses/disserta​tions,2016,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,Genetic Connectivity of Dungeness Crab (Cancer magister) in the California Current System and Puget Sound,NA,NA,NA,"Master of Science, Fisheries Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon",NA,NA

In 2015, the National Sea Grant Law Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law received a grant award from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s Fishing for Energy Partnership to help New England managers to assess the feasibility of implementing innovative derelict fishing gear removal strategies in their states. Lost nets and other heavy fishing equipment can damage ecosystems as they are moved by tides and waves along the sea floor, as well as impact navigational safety, damage active fishing equipment and boats, and cause economic repercussions for coastal industries and communities across the country. The laws and regulations governing the removal of derelict fishing gear vary by fishery and state. To assess the feasibility of implementing innovative removal strategies in their states, New England managers need a better understanding of the current legal framework governing derelict fishing gear removal and how existing state marine debris programs are authorized. As a first step towards increasing awareness and improving understanding of state derelict fishing gear laws and regulation, the NSGLC compiled the relevant laws and regulations related to derelict fishing gear for eleven priority states as identified by NFWF (Washington, California, Maine Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maryland, Virginia, Florida, Alabama, Connecticut, and Rhode Island). Relevant statutory and regulatory provisions were identified through traditional legal research methods. Each state compilation was sent to appropriate state agency contacts for review and feedback. For the priority states, the NSGLC analyzed the compiled laws and regulations to address several key management questions identified by the project Advisory Committee convened in January 2016. Committee members include: Sarah Cotnoir, Maine Department of Marine Resources; Dan McKiernan, Massachusetts Department of Energy and Environmental Affairs; Cheri Patterson, New Hampshire Fish and Game Department; Daniel Costa, Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management; Rachel Keylon and Keith Cialino, NOAA Marine Debris Program. For each state, the NSGLC addressed the following: state definitions for derelict fishing gear; requirements for marking gear and attending gear; prohibitions on “molesting” gear; requirements or authorizations to remove gear; closed periods for gear removal; and, other relevant definitions for derelict or abandoned property. Draft summaries were also sent to each state for review and comment. In addition to identifying the priority management questions, the Committee also identified model removal programs and strategies that could potentially be used by New England states. The NSGLC drafted legal cases studies of these six programs to gain a solid understanding of how they operate and provide a foundation for assessing their transferability to the New England region.

Usually these quota shares can be sold or leased, which is theorized to allow for greater utilization of fleet-wide quota. However, this catch-quota balancing may not be achieved in multispecies trawl fisheries where it is difficult to selectively target valuable species while avoiding overfished species. Two similar catch-​share-​managed, multispecies trawl fisheries were compared to evaluate whether catch shares lead to catch-quota balancing. The U.S. West Coast Groundfish fishery has several species with low total allowable catches (TACs) while the Canadian British Columbia Trawl fishery has comparatively higher TACs. Results indicate that the West Coast fishery had a statistically significant decrease in catch-quota ratios from 0.41 in the three years before catch shares to 0.29 in the three years after catch shares. In contrast, the BC fishery experience no statistically significant change in fishery-wide average catch-quota ratios, which were 0.70 in the three years before and 0.62 in the three years after catch shares. In the West Coast fishery, the risk of exceeding quotas for some species may be so high that fishers are unable to achieve high degrees of catch-quota balancing and instead focus on species that can be easily selected with changes in fishing behavior.

Bayesian inference is a powerful tool to better understand ecological processes across varied subfields in ecology, and is often implemented in generic and flexible software packages such as the widely used BUGS family (BUGS, WinBUGS, OpenBUGS and JAGS). However, some models have prohibitively long run times when implemented in BUGS. A relatively new software platform called Stan uses HamiltonianMont​e Carlo (HMC), a family of Markov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms which promise improved efficiency and faster inference relative to those used by BUGS. Stan is gaining traction in many fields as an alternative to BUGS, but adoption has been slow in ecology, likely due in part to the complex nature ofHMC. 2. Here, we provide an intuitive illustration of the principles of HMC on a set of simple models.We then compared the relative efficiency ofBUGS and Stan using population ecology models that vary in size and complexity. For hierarchical models, we also investigated the effect of an alternative parameterizatio​n of random effects, known as non-​centering. 3.. For small, simple models there is little practical difference between the two platforms, but Stan outperforms BUGS as model size and complexity grows. Stan also performs well for hierarchical models, but is more sensitive to model parameterizatio​n than BUGS.

Recruitment estimates are often large or small for several years in a row (termed “autocorrelated​” recruitment). Autocorrelated recruitment can be due to numerous factors, but typically is attributed to multi-year environmental drivers affecting early life survival rates. Estimating the magnitude of recruitment autocorrelation within a stock assessment model and examinations on its effect on the quality of forecasts of spawning biomass within stock assessments is uncommon. We used a simulation experiment to evaluate the estimability of autocorrelation within a stock assessment model over a range of levels of autocorrelation in recruitment deviations. The precision and accuracy of estimated autocorrelation​, and the ability of an integrated age-structured stock assessment framework to forecast the dynamics of the system, were compared for scenarios where the autocorrelation parameter within the assessment was fixed at zero, fixed at its true value, internally estimated within the integrated model, or input as a fixed value determined using an external estimation procedure that computed the sample autocorrelation of estimated recruitment deviations. Internal estimates of autocorrelation were biased toward extreme values (i.e., towards 1.0 when true autocorrelation was positive and −1.0 when true autocorrelation was negative). Estimates of autocorrelation obtained from the external estimation procedure were nearly unbiased. Forecast performance was poor (i.e., true biomass outside the predictive interval for the forecasted biomass) when autocorrelation was ignored, but was non-zero in the simulation. Applying the external estimation procedure generally improved forecast performance by decreasing forecast error and improving forecast interval coverage. However, estimates of autocorrelation were shown to degrade when fewer than 40 years of recruitment estimates were available.","Johnson, Kelli F.;Councill, Elizabeth;Thorson, James T.;Brooks, Elizabeth;Methot, Richard D.;Punt, Andre E.",WASHU-R-16-022,WSG-TA 16-31,E/I-25,reprints (peer-reviewed),2016,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Can autocorrelated recruitment be estimated using integrated assessment models and how does it affect population forecasts?,"Fisheries Research, 183:222-232, November 2016",10.1016/j.shres​.2016.06.004,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there has been considerable debate about whether releases effectively contribute to conservation and harvest objectives, and whether cultured organisms impact the fitness of wild populations. Pacific salmonid hatcheries on the West Coast of North America represent one of the largest enhancement programs in the world. Molecular-based pedigree studies on one or two generations have contributed to our understanding of the fitness of hatchery-reared individuals relative to wild individuals, and tend to show that hatchery fish have lower reproductive success. However, interpreting the significance of these results can be challenging because the long-term genetic and ecological effects of releases on supplemented populations are unknown. Further, pedigree studies have been opportunistic, rather than hypothesis driven, and have not provided information on “best case” management scenarios. Here, we present a comparative, experimental approach based on genome-wide surveys of changes in diversity in two hatchery lines founded from the same population. We demonstrate that gene flow with wild individuals can reduce divergence from the wild source population over four generations. We also report evidence for consistent genetic changes in a closed hatchery population that can be explained by both genetic drift and domestication selection.

Therefore, in addition to identification, it includes sections on prevention, reporting, and collecting specimens. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) pose a significant environmental and economic threat to the ecosystems and communities of the Mid-Atlantic region and beyond. The Mid-Atlantic region encompasses eight states, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina, as well as Washington D.C. The region is home to the Chesapeake Bay; the largest estuary in the United States, with more than 150 major rivers and streams flowing into its 64,299-​square-​mile basin. In the Chesapeake Bay watershed alone, nearly 200 known or possible invasive species have been recorded. Global trade, human activities, recreation, and climate change are helping invasive species spread at accelerated rates. Once established, controlling their spread is both technically difficult and expensive, making eradication nearly impossible. Therefore, identifying and preventing the introduction of these species is the key to averting long-term ecosystem damage, and to ensuring the highest probability of effective control. This field guide is designed to aid science professionals and other interested individuals in AIS early detection and reporting. This reference can help water conservation officers, regional biologists, volunteer monitors, resource managers, educators, students, and other professionals working in the Mid-Atlantic’s waters to learn general information about significant AIS, identify the problem species, collect specimens for verification, and report new infestations.

We collaborated with fishermen to assess the practicality and potential effectiveness of two BSLs with aerial extents of 40 m for West Coast sablefish longline fishery. We also evaluated the effectiveness of night setting in reducing albatross bycatch rates using NOAA West Coast Groundfish Observer Program data from 2002-2013. Some West Coast vessels use floats to keep hooks off the seafloor, where macroinvertebra​tes and hagfish degrade bait and target catch. Results from our field work confirmed that pending regulations protected baits from bird attacks on longlines without floats, but not on longlines with floats. Floated longlines sank below the reach of albatrosses (2 m depth) at 157.7 m astern ± 44.8 95% CI or 2.3 times further astern than gear without floats (68.8 m ± 37.8 95% CI), well beyond the protection afforded by the 40 m BSL aerial extent. Albatross attacked floated longlines at rates ten times more (2.7 attacks/1000 hooks, 0.48 – 4.45 95%CI) than longlines without floats (0.20 attacks/1000 hooks, 0.01 – 0.36 95% CI). Night setting, however, reduced albatross bycatch rates an order of magnitude lower than setting during daylight hours. Therefore, night-setting could be an effective seabird bycatch prevention practice in the West Coast sablefish longline fishery and provide a practical alternative for vessels that elect to use floated longlines. These results highlight the importance of understanding region-specific longline characteristics in order to design effective bycatch reduction programs and regulations.","Gladics, Amanda J.;Melvin, Edward F.;Suryan, Robert M.;Good, Tom P.;Jannot, Jason E.;Guy, Troy J.",WASHU-WR-16-002,WSG-TR 16-10,A/ACE-1,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2016,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Best practices to avoid seabird bycatch in the US West Coast demersal longline fishery for sablefish,"Seventh Meeting of the Seabird Bycatch Working group, La Serena, Chile, May 2-4, 2016",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We tested a commercially available product and a prototype device, each operating in the visible region at 532 nm (green). The optical power output measured in the laboratory was similar for both (1.26 and 1.01 W, respectively) placing them well within the class-4 laser classification. The calculated Nominal Optical Hazard Distance (NOHD) for each was also similar (102 m and 192 m, respectively). Field trials were carried out on a trawl catcher-​processor off the Oregon-​Washington coast in October 2015. Trawl was selected over longline because it represents a worst-case challenge for seabird deterrence: large aggregations of birds feeding on an abundant food source (continuous offal discharge from the factory) 24/7. Attending seabirds (all species) showed little detectable response to the laser beam during daylight hours. At night however, Northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) showed a transient and localized response at lower vessel speeds (3.5 kts) while feeding in the offal plume. In contrast, gulls in flight at nighttime in pursuit of the vessel showed a strong aversion at higher vessels speeds (11 kts). These results suggest that laser beam detection by birds may be more challenging at high light levels. The implication is that lasers might be modified to increase its visual contrast during the day. From these field trials, lasers appear more likely to scare birds from an abundant food source at low light levels and success may be species and condition specific.","Melvin, Edward F.;Asher, William E.;Fernandez-​Juricic, Esteban;Lim, Amy",WASHU-WR-16-003,WSG-TR 16-11,A/ACE-1,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2016,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Results of initial trials to determine if laser light can prevent seabird bycatch in North Pacific fisheries,"Seventh Meeting of the Seabird Bycatch Working group, La Serena, Chile, May 2-4, 2016",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We tested this idea using multiple response variables emphasizing taxonomic and functional diversity in seagrass-​vegetated, edge, and unvegetated habitats across three estuaries in Washington State (USA). We also used these variables in tandem to evaluate functional redundancy as a proxy for ecosystem resistance and resilience. The estuaries spanned a twofold range in richness of mesopredatory fishes and decapods. Increases in per-sample abundance with habitat structure were confined to three of seven functional groups, specifically those occupying the water column or directly associated with seagrass shoots. Consequently, seagrass reduced mesopredator diversity by reducing evenness. Habitats differed in mesopredator assemblages despite their spatial proximity (~3 m), supported by multivariate analyses performed at functional and taxonomic resolutions, but site differences were less apparent functionally than taxonomically. Functional redundancy did not differ by habitat, but increased with the richness of the regional species pool. Edge habitats were generally intermediate in community structure, per-sample abundance, and diversity between seagrass and unvegetated habitats. Structural complexity provided a trait-specific enhancement of abundance, and this pattern applied across species pools. Because seagrass benefits species with certain traits, management focused on the low-intertidal estuarine habitat mosaic, rather than a particular habitat type, and on places where redundancy is already low, best supports mesopredator diversity and function.","Gross, Collin;Donoghue, Cinde;Pruitt, Casey;Trimble, Alan C.;Ruesink, Jennifer L.",WASHU-R-17-004,WSG-TA 17-02,R/HCE-14,reprints (peer-reviewed),2017,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Taxonomic and functional assessment of mesopredator diversity across an estuarine habitat mosaic,"Ecosphere, 8(4):e01792, April 2017",10.1002/ecs2.17​92,NA,Open Access,NA,NA

Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) is a prime candidate species for aquaculture but the rearing of sablefish larvae has not yet been experimentally tested with clay. This study tested whether clay is a viable algae substitute for rearing sablefish, and whether the relative performance of clay versus algae varies as a function of time. In the first week of larval rearing, algae (Nannochloropsi​s) produced more than three times greater survival than clay (Kentucky Ball Clay OM4). However, switching from algae to clay at the beginning of the second week led to 1.5 times greater larval growth compared to tanks where algae was used in both weeks. The performance difference between clay and algae, despite equal turbidity, suggests that clay and algae have potentially harmful and beneficial effects in addition to turbidity effects, and that these effects change through time. However, because the first experiment was a replacement study, it was not possible to know whether algae produced better survival in week one because 1) clay, which might be harmful, was not present, 2) algae, which might be beneficial, was present, or 3) both. A further additive study was conducted to test the second possibility. The experiment found that adding algae to clay in the first week of larval rearing leads to greater growth and survival, suggesting that algae has beneficial effects beyond turbidity. We discuss some possible mechanisms for potential harmful and beneficial effects of algae and clay.","Lee, Jonathan S.

In aquaculture, higher larval rearing temperatures can accelerate development and thus shorten the intensive and expensive larval rearing period. In a previous study with larval sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), time between first feeding on live prey and weaning onto artificial diets was shortened when larval rearing temperatures were increased from 12 °C to 15 °C or 18 °C. However, those higher temperatures may induce delayed or persistent effects that may not be detected until the fish are older. In this study, we took weaned fish from the above previous study and reared them for up to nine months at a common, naturally fluctuating temperature (mean 11 °C, SD 2.3, range 7.9–13.6 °C) to learn about effects of prior larval rearing temperature on future growth, flesh firmness, deformities, and phenotypic sex. At the beginning of this study, soon after weaning onto prepared feeds, larvae that had been previously reared at 18 °C were larger than larvae that had been previously reared at 12 °C or15 °C. However, 15 °C juveniles caught up in size to the 18 °C juveniles by 3.5 months after removal from the temperature exposures and rearing at common temperature, and surpassed them in size by nine months (weights at nine months for 12 °C: 438 ± 12 g, 15 °C: 530 ± 15 g, and 18 °C: 472 ± 11 g). Survival rates from weaning to the end of the nine-month common-​temperature rearing period were greater for fish previously reared at 15 °C(92.3%) than for fish previously reared at 12 °C (83.9%) or 18 °C (82.6%). After the nine-month common temperature rearing period, raw flesh from 15 °C fish was slightly softer than flesh from 18 °C fish, but neither treatment differed from 12 °C fish. Spinal deformities were highest in 12 °C fish, maxilla deformities were highest in 15 °C fish, and pelvic fin deformities were highest in 18 °C fish. Some deformities were associated withdecreased growth. Broodstock crosses significantly differed in frequencies of isthmus, pelvic fin, and maxilladeformit​ies, indicating possible genetic, maternal, and/or early environmental effects. Phenotypic sex matchedgenetic sex in all treatments; therefore, none of the prior temperature treatments induced sex reversal. This study shows that larval sablefish can be reared at temperatures > 12 °C without inducing severe long-term effects, and that warmer larval rearing temperatures—pa​rticularly 15 °C—may have benefits to rates of survival, deformity, and growth that do not become evident until long-term rearing after the temperature exposure period.","Lee, Jonathan S.F.;Cook, Matthew A.;Luckenbach, J.

Sockeye Salmon O. nerka are unique in that most populations require lakes to fulfill their life history. Thus, for Sockeye Salmon to colonize a system, projects like dam removals must provide access to lakes. However, if the lakes contain landlocked kokanee (lacustrine Sockeye Salmon), the recovery of Sockeye Salmon could be mediated by interactions between the two life history forms and the processes associated with the resumption of anadromy. Our objective was to evaluate the extent to which estimates of Sockeye Salmon smolt production and recovery are sensitive to the resumption of anadromy by kokanee after dam removal. We informed the analysis based on the abiotic and biotic features of Lake Sutherland, which was recently opened to passage after dam removal on the Elwha River, Washington. We first developed maximum expectations for the smolt-producing capacity of Lake Sutherland by using two predictive models developed from Sockeye Salmon populations in Alaska and British Columbia: one model was based on the mean seasonal biomass of macrozooplankto​n, and the other was based on the euphotic zone volume of the lake. We then constructed a bioenergetics-​based simulation model to evaluate how the capacity of Lake Sutherland to rear yearling smolts could change with varying degrees of anadromy among O. nerka fry. We demonstrated that (1) the smolt-producing capacity of a nursery lake for juvenile Sockeye Salmon changes in nonlinear ways with changes in smolt growth, mortality, and the extent to which kokanee resume anadromy after dam removal; (2) kokanee populations may be robust to changes in abundance after dam removal, particularly if lakes are located higher in the watershed on tributaries separate from where dams were removed; and (3) the productivity of newly establishing Sockeye Salmon can vary considerably depending on whether the population becomes rearing limited or is recruitment limited and depending on how adult escapement is managed.","Hansen, Adam G.;Gardner, Jennifer R.;Beauchamp David A.;Paradis, Rebecca;Quinn, Thomas P.",WASHU-R-16-025,WSG-TA 16-36,R/HCE-9,reprints (peer-reviewed),2016,American Fisheries Society,Washington Sea Grant,"Recovery of sockeye salmon in the Elwha River, Washington after dam removal: Dependence of smolt production on the resumption of anadromy by landlocked kokanee","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 145:1303-1317, 2016",10.1080/0002848​7.2016.1223752,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many of these practices were identical to those practiced by restoration volunteers in formal programs and align with Seattle Parks Department management objectives. Foragers actively sought to learn more about what practices are sustainable; many mentored others in sustainable harvesting practices. Most foragers emphasized the importance of treating plants and their environment with respect. The land stewards voiced some concerns about foraging in city parks, but most were cautiously supportive of opening up the parks to foragers. The study results suggest that an opportunity exists for park managers to develop alliances with foragers so as to leverage foragers’ everyday stewardship practices and accomplish some of their park restoration objectives.

A central challenge facing conservation is the development of practical means for addressing the interconnectedn​ess of ecosystem health and human well-being, advancing the fundamental interdisciplina​ry science that underlies conservation practice, and implementing this science in decisions to manage, preserve, and restore ocean ecosystems. To understand and protect the biodiversity of the ocean and ameliorate the negative impacts of ocean change on people, it is critical to understand human beliefs, values, behaviors, and impacts. Conversely, on a human-dominated planet, it is impossible to understand and address human well-being and chart a course for sustainable use of the oceans without understanding the implications of environmental change for human societies that depend on marine ecosystems and resources. This work therefore presents a timely, needed, and interdisciplina​ry approach to the conservation of our oceans. Key features in this book: *Helps marine conservation scientists and practitioners apply principles from oceanography, ecology, anthropology, economics, political science, and other natural and social sciences to manage and preserve marine ecosystems. *Facilitates understanding of how and why social and environmental processes are coupled in the quest to achieve healthy and sustainable oceans. *Uses a combination of expository material, practical approaches, and forward-looking theoretical discussion to enhance value for readers as they consider conservation research, management, and planning.

This paper outlines a framework for measuring human well-being for ecosystem-based management (EBM). We present a prototype that can be adapted and developed for various scales and contexts. Scientists and managers use indicators to assess status and trends in integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs). To improve the social science rigor and success of EBM, we developed a systematic and transparent approach for evaluating indicators of human well-being for an IEA.Methods: Our process is based on a comprehensive conceptualizati​on of human well-being, a scalable analysis of management priorities, and a set of indicator screening criteria tailored to the needs of EBM. We tested our approach by evaluating more than 2000 existing social indicators related to ocean and coastal management of the US West Coast. We focused on two foundational attributes of human well-being: resource access and self-​determination.O​utcomes and Discussion: Our results suggest that existing indicators and data are limited in their ability to reflect linkages between environmental change and human well-being, and extremely limited in their ability to assess social equity and justice. We reveal a critical need for new social indicators tailored to answer environmental questions and new data that are disaggregated by social variables to measure equity. In both, we stress the importance of collaborating with the people whose well-being is to be assessed.Conclu​sion: Our framework is designed to encourage governments and communities to carefully assess the complex tradeoffs inherent in environmental decision-​making.","Breslow, Sarah Jo;Allen, Margaret;Holstein, Danielle;Sojka, Brit;Barnea, Raz;Basurto, Xavier;Carothers, Courtney;Charnley, Susan;Coulthard, Sarah;Dolsak, Nives;Donatuto, Jamie;Garcia-Quijano, Carlos;Hicks, Christina C.;Levine, Arielle;Mascia, Michael B.;Norman, Karma;Poe, Melissa;Satterfield, Terre;St. Martin, Kevin;Levin, Phillip S.",WASHU-R-17-011,NA,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),2017,Taylor and Francis,Washington Sea Grant,Evaluating Indicators of human well-being for ecosystem-based management,"Ecosystem Health and Sustainability, 3(12):1-18, published online, doi: 10.1080/2096412​9.2017.1411767,​ December 19, 2017",10.1080/2096412​9.2017.1411767,NA,OPEN ACCESS,NA,NA

We used time series of bathymetry, substrate grain size, remotely sensed turbidity, scuba dive surveys, and towed video observations collected before and during dam removal to assess responses of the nearshore subtidal community (3 m to 17 m depth). Biological changes were primarily driven by sediment deposition and elevated suspended sediment concentrations. Macroalgae, predominantly kelp and foliose red algae, were abundant before dam removal with combined cover levels greater than 50%. Where persistent sediment deposits formed, macroalgae decreased greatly or were eliminated. In areas lacking deposition, macroalgae cover decreased inversely to suspended sediment concentration, suggesting impacts from light reduction or scour. Densities of most invertebrate and fish taxa decreased in areas with persistent sediment deposition; however, bivalve densities increased where mud deposited over sand, and flatfish and Pacific sand lance densities increased where sand deposited over gravel. In areas without sediment deposition, most invertebrate and fish taxa were unaffected by increased suspended sediment or the loss of algae cover associated with it; however, densities of tubeworms and flatfish, and primary cover of sessile invertebrates increased suggesting benefits of increased particulate matter or relaxed competition with macroalgae for space. As dam removal neared completion, we saw evidence of macroalgal recovery that likely owed to water column clearing, indicating that long-term recovery from dam removal effects may be starting.

However, these waters are home to several species of algae that can produce deadly toxins when water conditions encourage their populations to explode. During these harmful algal blooms (HABs), the algae and their toxins accumulate in shellfish and are also transferred up the food chain to marine and terrestrial animals. High concentrations of some algal species can sicken or kill marine birds, mammals, or humans and can cause fish to die in large numbers. We formed SoundToxins—the Partnership for Enhanced Monitoring and Emergency Response to HABs in Puget Sound—to combat the apparent increase in these HAB occurrences over the past decade. SoundToxins is a diverse partnership of shellfish farmers, fish farmers, environmental learning centers, volunteers, local health jurisdictions, colleges, and Native American tribes that was conceived and initiated by the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), and is now co-directed by Washington Sea Grant (WSG).

The state and federal permits and regulations sections have been updated. What is Direct Marketing? Times are changing in the fishing and seafood industries. Demand for seafood is increasing. A strong dollar is making American seafood more expensive abroad. Fuel prices are down, at least for now, but other costs are up. Technology is making fish harvesting, processing and distribution more efficient and more competitive. Online purchasing and social media are changing the ways people find and purchase goods. Ocean climate change is altering patterns of resource abundance, distribution and behaviors. People want to feel more of a connection with their food and know its source. Competition in the marketplace among food choices is increasing. Change brings threats and opportunities. One way a fishing business can respond to both is to get more money for the product it sells. ""Direct marketing"" means selling the catch at some point further up the distribution or ""value-adding"" chain from the usual destination—the local seafood processing plant. A direct marketer can sell directly to the consumer, or to a buyer at any other level in the system. It means getting paid for the value of the raw product but also any value that is accrued as it is processed, packaged, transported and sold to the final user or consumer.

Key findings are: (1) internal moral calculations about whether it is right or wrong to harvest a particular NTFP in a particular place are an important but previously unacknowledged mechanism governing resource access; and (2) these calculations may help prevent over-harvesting of NTFPs, which are common pool resources, in urban environments where social and environmental conditions lend themselves to a de facto situation of open access.

We collaborated with fishermen to assess the efficacy of applying BSL regulations from the demersal longline sablefish fishery in Alaska to a similar fishery along the U.S West Coast. In contrast to Alaska, some U.S. West Coast vessels use floats along the line to keep hooks off the seafloor, where scavengers degrade the bait and the target catch. Our results confirmed that BSL regulations from Alaska were sufficient to protect baits from bird attacks on longlines without floats, but not baits on longlines with floats. Longlines with floats sank below the reach of albatrosses (2 m depth) at a distance astern (157.7 m ± 44.8 95% CI) that was 2.3 times farther than longlines without floats (68.8 m ± 37.8 95% CI). The floated longline distance was well beyond the protection afforded by BSLs, which is approximately 40 m of aerial extent. Black-footed albatross attacked floated longlines at rates ten times more (2.7 attacks/1000 hooks, 0.48–4.45 95%CI) than longlines without floats (0.20 attacks/1000 hooks, 0.01–0.36 95% CI). Retrospective analysis of NOAA Fisheries Groundfish Observer Program data suggested that seabird bycatch occurs in a few sablefish longline fishing sectors and a minority of vessels, but is not confined to larger vessels. Analysis also confirmed fishermen testimonials that night setting reduced albatross bycatch by an order of magnitude compared to daytime setting, without reducing target catch. Night setting could be an effective albatross bycatch prevention practice if applied to the U.S. West Coast sablefish longline fishery and provide a practical alternative for vessels that elect to use floated longlines. These results highlight the importance of understanding region-specific longline gear modifications to identify effective bycatch reduction tools and the value of working collaboratively with fishermen to craft solutions.","Gladics, Amanda J.;Melvin, Edward F.;Suryan, Robert M.;Good, Thomas P.;Jannot, Jason E.;Guy, Troy J.",WASHU-R-17-017,WSG-TA 17-17,A/ACE-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2017,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Fishery-​specific solutions to seabird bycatch in the U.S. West Coast sablefish fishe​ry,"Fisheries Research, 196:85-95, December 2017",10.1016/j.fishr​es.2017.08.015,https://www.sci​encedirect.com/​science/article​/pii/S016578361​7302291?via%3Di​hub,Open access,NA,NA

Extending an established procedure for deriving annual, fractional estimates of impervious surface cover (ISC) from per-pixel Landsat composites, here we propose a new post classification methodology that characterizes ISC change as a continuous field in space and time. The method statistically derives the magnitude, timing and duration of ISC change at a per-pixel basis. We applied the method to a series of ISC maps of the Washington DC-Baltimore metropolitan region at an annual resolution from 1984 to 2010 to analyze the spatial, temporal and thematic patterns of urban/suburban land development. Our method was highly reliable for detecting and characterizing change, with producer's accuracy of the change-year classes (timing layer) varying between 59.4% and 97.4% and user's accuracy varying between 54.7% and 91.7%, based on a sample of independent validation points. Most misclassificati​ons were found between neighboring years; relaxing the estimated change-year to +/- 1 year increased both producer's and user's accuracy to >80%. The derived change products showed that newly developed pixels on average had a 46% increase in ISC, with the majority (80%) reaching their ISC saturation level in <= 3 years. Across the study region, annual growth in impervious surface area accelerated from similar to 6 km(2)/year (0.7% of urban area in 1984) in the mid-1980s to similar to 12 km(2)/year in the late-2010s, with a large inter-annual variability among municipalities and over successive years. Of these emerged urban pixels, 89% were converted from non-urban to low- and medium-density urban features, mostly suburban residential land use. However, the relative proportions of low-, medium- and high density urban development changed dramatically over the study period, indicating that urban sprawl of the metropolis experienced major transitions in terms of land use intensity in the past three decades. Although primarily designed for change detection, our method can also be used as a temporal smoothing technique to remove noise in time-series of land cover datasets.

However, for CPUE to be an unbiased index, influences that are not related to population abundance (e.g., spatial variation in effort and temporal changes in gear efficiency) must be accounted for in analyses known as CPUE standardization​. In longline fisheries, one important factor that can affect CPUE is the spacing between hooks (‘spacing effect’), which influences effective effort and has largely been ignored in previous analyses. Here, we use the Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) long-line fishery as a case study to explore the spacing effect. Both commercial and experimental (fishery-​independent) data with hook spacing, and a survey-based CPUE series, are available for this fishery. It thus provides a unique opportunity to explore the effect of hook spacing and its effect on CPUE trends. We quantify this effect using non-parametric and parametric relationships inside a spatially-​explicit (geospatial) CPUE standardization model for commercial data, and non-linear mixed-effects model for experimental data. We found a clear non-linear spacing effect (i.e., hooks were less effective the closer they were), but accounting for space had a larger effect on CPUE trends than accounting for hook spacing. For this stock, it is likely the effect of hook spacing on CPUE was minimal due to little variation in average hook spacing over time. Regardless, historical and future trends in hook spacing can have important effects on longline CPUE standardization​, highlighting the value of collecting this information. Accounting for hook spacing effects in other fisheries may improve estimates of trends in relative abundance and lead to better management.","Monnahan, Cole C.;Stewart, Ian J.",WASHU-R-17-018,WSG-TA 17-19,E/I-21,reprints (peer-reviewed),2017,NA,Washington Sea Grant,The effect of hook spacing on longline catch rates: Implications for catch rate standardization,"Fisheries Research, 198:150-158, published online doi: 10.1016/j.fishr​es.2017.10.004,​ October 26, 2017",10.1016/j.fishr​es.2017.10.004,NA,Open access,NA,NA10OAR4320148 (2010–2015);NA15OAR4320063 (2015–2020);NA14OAR4170078

Although these contributing factors have been studied separately, interactions between them are potentially problematic. In this study we set up a simple simulation intended to provide general guidance to analysts on the performance of an age-structured model under differing assignments of compositional data weight and process variance. We compared cases where the true sample size is under-, ‘right-’ or over-weighted, and the degree of process variance (in this case temporal variability in selectivity) is under, correctly, or overestimated. Each case was evaluated with regard to estimation of spawning biomass, and MSY-related quantities. We also explored the effects of the estimation of natural mortality, steepness, as well as incorrectly specifying process error in selectivity when there is none. Results showed that right-weighted estimation models assuming the correct degree of process error performed best in estimating all quantities. Underweighting produced larger relative errors in spawning biomass, particularly when too much process error was allowed. Conversely, overweighting produced larger errors mainly when the degree of process error was underestimated. MSY-related quantities were sensitive to both the estimation of natural mortality, and particularly steepness. We suggest that data weighting and the treatment of process error should not be considered independently: estimation is most likely to be robust when process error is allowed (even if overestimated) and when compositional data are not excessively down-weighted.","Stewart, Ian J.;Monnahan, Cole C.",WASHU-R-17-019,WSG-TA 17-18,E/I-21,reprints (peer-reviewed),2017,Elsevier,Washington Sea Grant,Implications of process error in selectivity for approaches to weighting compositional data in fisheries stock assessments,"Fisheries Research,192:12​6-​134, 2017",10.1016/j.fishr​es.2016.06.018,NA,NA,NA,NA10OAR4320148

Comparisons of fitness between captive‐ and wild‐origin individuals, for example, do not reveal how captive rearing affects genetic variation underlying fitness traits or which traits are most susceptible to domestication selection. Here, we used data collected across four generations to identify loci associated with six traits in adult Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and then determined how two alternative management approaches for captive rearing affected variation at these loci. Loci associated with date of return to freshwater spawning grounds (return timing), length and weight at return, age at maturity, spawn timing, and daily growth coefficient were identified using 9108 restriction site‐associated markers and random forest, an approach suitable for polygenic traits. Mapping of trait‐associate​d loci, gene annotations, and integration of results across multiple studies revealed candidate regions involved in several fitness‐related traits. Genotypes at trait‐associate​d loci were then compared between two hatchery populations that were derived from the same source but are now managed as separate lines, one integrated with and one segregated from the wild population. While no broad‐scale change was detected across four generations, there were numerous regions where trait‐associate​d loci overlapped with signatures of adaptive divergence previously identified in the two lines. Many regions, primarily with loci linked to return and spawn timing, were either unique to or more divergent in the segregated line, suggesting that these traits may be responding to domestication selection. This study is one of the first to utilize genomic approaches to demonstrate the effectiveness of a conservation strategy, managed gene flow, on trait‐associate​d—and potentially adaptive—loci. The results will promote the development of trait‐specific tools to better monitor genetic change in captive and wild populations.","Waters, Charles D.;Hard, Jeffrey J.;Brieuc, Marine S.

Fortunately, sablefish are excellent species for commercial aquaculture. Sablefish raised under high‐density conditions in the marine environment require the use of efficacious vaccines to control disease. Sablefish impacted by disease in net pens may have poor flesh quality and high mortality during grow‐out. As a result, disease can cause financial hardship for sablefish aquaculture operators. The efficacy of a multivalent vaccine preparation for sablefish, administered either by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or by immersion, against atypical and typical Aeromonas salmonicida, the causative agents of atypical and typical furunculosis, respectively, was examined. A. salmonicida can affect sablefish at any age and size. Consequently, an efficacious vaccine that can be appropriately and optimally administered to all life stages is desirable. Sablefish vaccinated by immersion at ~1.5 or ~4.5 g with a whole‐cell multivalent vaccine were not protected against either typical or atypical A. salmonicida. Factors that may have contributed to the ineffectiveness of the immersion vaccine are discussed. By contrast, the relative per cent survival (RPS) or potency of the whole‐cell multivalent vaccine injected i.p. in juvenile sablefish at ~50 g against typical and atypical A. salmonicida was 94.3% and 81.7% respectively. The high RPS values indicated that the vaccine successfully initiated an immune response in sablefish upon a second encounter with the pathogen.","Arkoosh, Mary R.;Dietrich, Josep​h P.;Rew, Mary Beth;Olson, Wendy;Young, Graham;Goetz, Frederic​k W.",WASHU-R-18-003,WSG-TA 17-22,R/SFA/N-2,reprints (peer-reviewed),2018,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Exploring the efficacy of vaccine techniques in juvenile sablefish, Anop​lopoma fimbria","Aquaculture Research, 49(1):205-216, January 2018",10.1111/are.134​49,NA,Open access,NA,NA14OAR4170078

Much attention has been paid to NPS in rural areas, where agricultural activities increase nutrients, toxics, and sediments in surface water. Stormwater from urban areas is also a major contributor to NPS pollution. For watersheds bearing various soil types and land uses, a single type of BMP cannot be the panacea to all stormwater problems. To solve these problems, a Diagnostic Decision Support System (DDSS) was developed in this research. The DDSS can identify and locate the most critical NPS areas (hotspots) within a watershed in high spatial resolution. The DDSS can provide a series of spatially distributed small-scale BMPs which are effective in treating the NPS and are suitable for the physical environment. The BMPs, varying in types and locations, are recommended at HRU (Hydrologic Response Unit) level. The DDSS was tested in Watts Branch, a small urban watershed of the Anacostia River in metropolitan Washington D. C., USA. The process-based hydrologic model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was used to simulate watershed responses. The simulation results were then used by the DDSS for BMP recommendation. Hotspots of different NPS were successfully located and prescribed with spatially distributed BMPs. The DDSS serves as a useful tool to better understand urban watersheds and to make proper stormwater management plans.","Wang, Yan;Montas, Hubert J.;Brubaker, Kaye L.;Leisnham, Paul T.;Shirmohammadi, Adel;Chanse, Victoria;Rockler, Amanda K.",MDU-R-17-016,UM-​SG-​RS-​2017-​19,A/EX-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2017,NA,Maryland Sea Grant,A Diagnostic Decision Support System for BMP Selection in Small Urban Watershed,"Water Resources Management, 31(5):1649-​1664, March 2017",10.1007/s11269-​017-​1605-​x,NA,NA,NA,NA

At least nine tsunami deposits dating back 2500 yr are preserved as fine sand layers in peaty tidal marsh deposits. Discovery Bay is a setting that amplifies tsunami waves, has an abundant sediment source, and a tidal marsh that traps and preserves tsunami deposits. The youngest deposit, bed 1, is probably from the 1700 A.D. Cascadia earthquake. Bed 2 has a newly revised age of 630–560 cal yr B.P. (1320–1390 A.D.), an age range that overlaps with the ages of tsunami deposits from Vancouver, British Columbia, and northern Oregon, as well as evidence for strong shaking in the region including submarine and sublacustrine slope failures. However, there is no geologic evidence for a late fourteenth-​century earthquake or tsunami in any of the southwest Washington estuaries that record seven Cascadia earthquakes in the last 3500 yr. Discovery Bay bed 2 and similar-aged evidence in the region may represent a short rupture on the Cascadia subduction thrust, possibly centered west of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, that did not cause significant coastal subsidence. Other possible sources considered for bed 2 include a crustal fault earthquake, a tsunamigenic slope failure, or a transoceanic tsunami. Older tsunami deposits beds 3–9, which outnumber the number of Cascadia earthquakes in the last 2500 yr, are likely from a combination of Cascadia and non-Cascadia sources.

By the summer of 2017, pyrosomes appeared in unprecedented numbers along the entire west coast, reaching the Western Gulf of Alaska, but showed some of their highest abundances off Oregon clogging nets and disrupting marine activities such as commercial and sport fisheries. The impacts of these dense blooms and the extent on ecological interactions are unknown. Moreover, their appearance in multiple years and the capacity to reach bloom proportions suggests that pyrosomes may even thrive in colder waters, especially during more oligotrophic conditions, and could become more permanent residents in the California Current marine ecosystem. Their continued presence will likely become a nuisance for certain fishing activities, causing fishermen to relocate or spend extra time sorting their catch. Large pyrosome aggregations have the potential to restructure energy flows through food webs via efficient removal of photosynthetic plankton and subsequent fecal pellet production, consumption by higher trophic levels, or sinking to depth.","Sutherland, Kelly R.;Sorensen, Hilarie L.;Blondheim, Olivia N.;Brodeur, Richard D.;Galloway, Aaron W.

From June 2012 to July 2016, we examined 42 heavily fouled debris items and, using both morphology and sequencing data, identified 84 species and varieties of marine algae and cyanobacteria on the debris.

Plaques took 8–12 days to achieve full strength at pH 8, nearly doubling in adhesion strength (+94%) and increasing the work required to dislodge (+59%). Holding plaques in low pH conditions prevented strengthening, causing the material to tear more frequently under tension. The timescale of strengthening is consistent with the conversion of DOPA to DOPA-quinone, a pH dependent process that promotes cross-linking between adhesive proteins.

Armoring structures, such as riprap and bulkheads, that are built to prevent beach erosion and protect coastal infrastructure from storms and flooding can cause deterioration of habitats for migratory fish species, disrupt aquatic–terrest​rial connectivity, and reduce overall coastal ecosystem health. Relative to armored shorelines, natural shorelines retain valuable habitats for macroinvertebra​tes and other coastal biota. One question is whether the impacts of armoring are reversible, allowing restoration via armoring removal and related actions of sediment nourishment and replanting of native riparian vegetation. Armoring removal is targeted as a viable option for restoring some habitat functions, but few assessments of coastal biota response exist. Here, we use opportunistic sampling of pre- and post-​restoration data for five biotic measures (wrack % cover, saltmarsh % cover, number of logs, and macroinvertebra​te abundance and richness) from a set of six restored sites in Puget Sound, WA, USA. This broad suite of ecosystem metrics responded strongly and positively to armor removal, and these results were evident after less than one year.

As rising pressures from population growth, development, unsustainable resource use, climate impacts and other factors alter this urbanizing basin, eﬀorts to recover salmon and ecosystem health and to enhance climate resilience face unprecedented social complexities and intensifying competition for space. A multi-method study of citizen and practitioner perspectives on protection and restoration suggests that capacity to manage under these conditions can be improved through strengthening an approach that has already become central in restoration practice: multiple-beneﬁt planning. In this research, we examine and compare planning approaches used to develop marine protected areas (MPA) and estuary restoration (ER) projects in Puget Sound. Surveying non-tribal public attitudes toward these projects, we found limited knowledge concerning existing MPAs but support for wider use of such protections. We ﬁnd that initiatives pursuing conservation, protection, restoration and resilience can gain advantage from (a) broadly inclusive and collaborative planning; (b) recognition of tribal treaty rights, management authorities, and leadership; (c) careful consideration and mitigation of project impacts on aﬀected people (e.g. especially tribal and non-tribal ﬁsheries for MPAs; farm interests and landowners for restoration projects). We note that “no-take” MPA designation has stalled, while ER eﬀorts are overcoming sharp objections and controversies by crafting projects to deliver multiple social-​ecological beneﬁts: improved ﬂood control and drainage, salmon recovery, recreational enjoyment, and resilience to climate change. Comparable strategies have not yet evolved in designation of “no-take” MPAs in Puget Sound.

Aggregate abundance was enhanced inside eelgrass (in seines) and on edges (in videos) relative to unvegetated habitats, a difference attributed to the abilities of the 2 methods to sample dominant taxa in different habitats. Both methods concurred that structure-​association primarily occurred for pelagic, not benthic taxa. Videos suggested that shiner perch and stickleback moved more slowly in eelgrass interiors relative to unvegetated habitat, that stickleback fed more frequently in interior habitat, and that habitat use did not differ between low and high water. Eelgrass appears to disproportionat​ely benefit small pelagic taxa rather than benthic species, but no distinct responses to edges were detected for the distribution or behavior of dominant taxa. Overall, responses to structure were taxon specific, and for most taxa, shoot structure seemed more important than landscape structure for distribution and behavior.

We used 0‐inflated negative binomial models to evaluate variables influencing seabird bycatch per unit effort (BPUE) in 2 target fisheries.

Despite this, BPUE increased significantly in 2 of 4 target fisheries since streamer lines were adopted.

The project will improve risk projections, provide better guidance for land use planners and strengthen capital investment programs for coastal restoration and infrastructure. Sea level is rising along much of Washington’s coast and is projected to rise at an accelerating rate as the climate continues to warm. Local variation in vertical land movement causes different rates of relative sea level change along the coast and in Puget Sound. For example, the Seattle tide gauge shows relative sea level rise (SLR) of 8.6 inches since 1900 due to a combination of land subsidence and SLR. In contrast, relative sea level has dropped in Neah Bay by 5.2 inches since 1934 due to a localized area of rapid uplift of the land. Rising seas and associated changes in coastal hazards such as flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion will impact nearshore restoration projects.

The CCIEA team provides ESRs annually to PFMC, as one component of the overall CCIEA goal of providing quantitative, integrative science tools, products, and synthesis in support of a more holistic (ecosystem-​based) approach to managing marine resources in the California Current.This report presents indicators codeveloped by the CCIEA team and PFMC beginning in 2009. The indicators have been refined and updated over the years to best capture the current state of the California Current ecosystem. The analyses in this document thus represent our best understanding of environmental, ecological, and socioeconomic conditions in this ecosystem roughly through 2017. Because the time required to process the data from different indicators can vary, some of the resulting time series are slightly more up-to-date than others. Some indicators (snowpack, fishery landings, and revenue) have been updated since the March 2018 report to PFMC (Harvey et al. 2018).In terms of the natural biophysical system, we regarded 2017 as a transitional year, in which the CCE continued its recovery from the marine heat wave of 2013–16 and the major El Niño event of 2015–16. We similarly considered much of 2016 to be transitional. By “transitional,” we mean that many indicators suggest that the system has shifted away from the highly unusual conditions of the marine heat wave and El Niño events, which included very warm water temperatures, weaker-​than-​normal southward-​flowing currents along the U. S. West Coast, and widespread occurrence of species normally associated with warmer southerly and/or offshore waters (including the pyrosomes featured on the cover of this report). However, aspects of these conditions remain in patches throughout the system, and we do not feel confident that the system has returned to a more typical regime (e.g., the relatively cool and productive periods or warm and unproductive periods governed by climate and oceanography patterns that have been observed for much of the past century). Moreover, some populations of protected species and others targeted by fisheries may show the effects of the unusual warming events at lag times of months to years, even after physical conditions and characteristics of the base of the food web have returned to average or above-average conditions. Man​y indicators of fishery landings and revenue have increased since a recent low point in 2015, with increases mainly attributable to Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens), and Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister). Conversely, recreational fishery landings have been declining since 2015. We continued to observe a decline in the diversification of catch revenues by commercial fishing vessels of all size and revenue classes in all three coastal states; in other words, on average, vessels are relying on steadily fewer species to provide the bulk of their revenues. We are working to understand how the reliance of coastal communities on commercial and recreational fishing relates to those communities’ overall social wellbeing and vulnerability.","Harvey, Chris;Garfield, Newell;Williams, Gregory;Tolimieri, Nick;Schroeder, Isaac;Hazen, Elliott;Andrews, Kelly;Barnas, Katie;Bograd, Steven;Brodeur, Richard;Burke, Brian;Cope, Jason;deWitt, Lynn;Field, John;Fisher, Jennifer;Good, Thomas;Greene, Correigh;Holland, Daniel;Hunsicker, Mary;Jacox, Michael;Kasperski, Stephen;Kim, Su;Leising, Andrew;Melin, Sharon;Morgan, Cheryl;Muhling, Barbara;Munsch, Stuart;Norman, Karma;Peterson, William;Poe, Melissa;Samhouri, Jameal;Sydeman, William;Thayer, Julie;Thompson, Andrew;Tommasi, Desiree;Varney, Anna;Wells, Brian;Williams, Thomas;Zamon, Jeannette;Lawson, Dan;Anderson, Sean;Gao, Jin;Litzow, Mike;McClatchie, Sam;Ward, Eric;Zador, Stephani",WASHU-T-18-004,WSG-TR 18-06;NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-NWFSC-145,A/ACE-1,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2018,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Ecosystem Status Report of the California Current for 2018: A Summary of Ecosystem Indicators Compiled by the California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment Team (CCIEA),NA,10.25923/mvhf-​yk36,NA,NA,NA,NA

OA effects on individual organisms may be synergistically amplified or reduced by inter- and intraspecies interactions as they propagate up to population and community levels, altering predictions by studies of calcifier responses in isolation. The calcifying colonial bryozoan Membranipora membranacea and the predatory nudibranch Corambe steinbergae comprise a trophic system strongly regulated by predator-​induced defensive responses and space limitation, presenting a unique system to investigate OA effects on these regulatory mechanisms at individual and population levels. We experimentally quantified OA effects across a range of pH from 7.0 to 7.9 on growth, calcification, senescence and predator-​induced spine formation in Membranipora, with or without waterborne predator cue, and on zooid consumption rates in Corambe at Friday Harbor Laboratories, San Juan Island, WA. Membranipora exhibited maximum growth and calcification at moderately low pH (7.6), and continued spine formation in all pH treatments. Spines reduced Corambe zooid consumption rates, with lower pH weakening this effect. Using a spatially explicit model of colony growth, where colony area serves as a proxy for colony fitness, we assessed the population-​level impacts of these experimentally determined individual-​level effects in the context of space limitation. The area-based fitness costs associated with defense measured at the individual level led to amplified effects predicted for the population level due to competition.

Fishing can, thereby, have far reaching consequences on marine food webs unless safeguards are in place to avoid depleting forage fish to dangerously low levels, where dependent predators are most vulnerable. However, disentangling the contributions of fishing vs. natural processes on population dynamics has been difficult because of the sensitivity of these stocks to environmental conditions. Here, we overcome this difficulty by collating population time series for forage fish populations that account for nearly two-thirds of global catch of forage fish to identify the fingerprint of fisheries on their population dynamics. Forage fish population collapses shared a set of common and unique characteristics​: high fishing pressure for several years before collapse, a sharp drop in natural population productivity, and a lagged response to reduce fishing pressure. Lagged response to natural productivity declines can sharply amplify the magnitude of naturally occurring population fluctuations. Finally, we show that the magnitude and frequency of collapses are greater than expected from natural productivity characteristics and therefore, likely attributed to fishing. The durations of collapses, however, were not different from those expected based on natural productivity shifts. A risk-based management scheme that reduces fishing when populations become scarce would protect forage fish and their predators from collapse with little effect on long-term average catches.","Essington, Timothy E.;Moriarty, Pamela E.;Froehlich, Hailey E.;Hodgson, Emma E.;Koehn, Laura E.;Oken, Kiva L.;Siple, Margaret C.;Stawitz, Christine C.",WASHU-R-15-039,WSG-TA 18-17,R/E/I-24,reprints (peer-reviewed),2015,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Fishing amplifies forage fish population collapses,"PNAS, 112(21):6648-​6652, May 26, 2015",10.1073/pnas.14​22020112,NA,Freely available online through the PNAS open access option,"Kareiva, Peter M.",NA

This study addresses this problem through the development of an emulator, or surrogate model, which replaces the simulator (in this case the coupled ADCIRC+SWAN model) with a statistical representation ​ that is able to rapidly predict estuarine variables relevant to flooding. Emulation of water levels (WLs), non-tidal residual, and significant wave height, is explored at Grays Harbor, Washington (WA) USA using Gaussian process regression. The effectiveness of the methodology is validated at various model simplification levels to determine where error is being sourced. Emulated WLs are found to be skillful when compared to over a decade of tide gauge observations (root mean square error, RMSE,<15 cm). The largest loss of skill in the method originates with ADCIRC+SWAN attempting to reproduce observations, even when the majority of relevant physics are included. Subsequent simplifications​ to the simulator (input reduction techniques) and the emulator itself are found to introduce a trivial amount of error (average increase in RMSE of 1 cm). Emulated WLs are also compared to spatially varying observations and found to be equally skillful throughout the estuary. An example emulation application is explored by decomposing the relative forcing contributions to extreme WLs across the study site. Results show a compound nature of extreme estuarine WLs in that all forcing dimensions contribute to extremes, with streamflow having the least influence and tides the largest. Overall the approach is shown to be both skillful and efficient at reproducing critical hydrodynamic variables, suggesting that emulation may play a key role in improving our ability to probabilistical​ly assess flood risk in complex environments as well as being promising in a range of other applications.","Parker, Kai;Ruggiero, Peter;Serafin, Katherine A.;Hill, David F.",ORESU-R-19-007,ORESU-R-19-007,E/INT-143 E/A-16,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Elsevier,Oregon Sea Grant,Emulation as an approach for rapid estuarine modeling,"Coastal Engineering, 150:79-93, August 2019",10.1016/j.coast​aleng.2019.03.0​04,NA,NA,NA,NA

European green crab (EGC) is a globally-​damaging invasive species that has produced a variety of ecological and economic impacts on temperate coastal shorelines worldwide. Prolific and gregarious, EGC are known to disturb native habitat, displace resident species, and alter natural food webs, when abundant. Additionally, EGC predation has caused significant harm to shellfish industries in some regions. Using lessons learned from successful early detection and rapid responses, this Salish Sea Transboundary Action Plan for Invasive European Green Crab lays out clear actions to be taken to prevent and/or minimize harm to the environmental, economic, and human resources of the Salish Sea as a whole from an invasion of European green crab. This action plan focuses on six objectives calling for: • Collaborative management; • Prevention of human-mediated introduction and spread; • Early detection; • Rapid response to newly detected incursions; • Control of infested sites; and • Strategic research to improve adaptive management. Was​hington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), and Transport Canada are the key regulatory managers of potential human-mediated introduction and spread of EGC through their respective Aquatic Invasive Species programs. Washington Sea Grant’s (WSG) Crab Team program, in coordination with WDFW, plays a major role in early detection and rapid response by training and supporting hundreds of volunteers and agency and tribal staff to monitor sites for early detection. The actions laid out in this plan follow WDFW’s and DFO’s legal authority and mandate to lead the response to EGC in the Salish Sea. The estimated costs of implementing this plan for the Washington State 2019-21 fiscal year biennium (July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2021) and projections for future years will be addressed in a separate budget document.

Using field and laboratory studies, we investigated how residence time and natural enemies (co-evolved castrating parasite, and native crabs) differ between two introduced populations of the intertidal snail, Batillaria attramentaria. The populations have substantially different invasion histories (~ 10 vs. > 80 years) and exhibit markedly different densities and tidal distributions. The less-dense, vertically-​restricted population was recently introduced, and thus has potentially had less opportunity to fill the fundamental niche at that site. However, no increase in density or intertidal range occurred in this population over 10 years, suggesting that it had reached its realized niche. The newer population experienced much greater effects of native cancrid crabs than the older, high-density population, particularly below the minimum tidal elevation of observed snail distribution, where crabs were found in the greatest densities. Prevalence of parasite infection did not differ between populations. This is the first study documenting effects of predators on this invasive snail, which is widespread along coastlines of the northeast Pacific, whereas previous studies have suggested that the primary restriction on population growth rate was likely to be parasitic castration. Further, this study supports the general understanding that, while novel predators can reduce the impacts or population growth rates of invasive species, such top-down effects are not likely to preclude persistence at a given site.","Grason, Emily W​.;McDonald, P.

Globally, river systems have been extensively modified through alterations in riverscapes and flow regimes, reducing their capacity to absorb geophysical and environmental changes. 2. In western North America and elsewhere, alterations in natural flow regimes and swimways through dams, levees, and floodplain development, work in concert with fire regime, forest management practices, as well as agriculture and urban development, to change recovery trajectories of river systems. 3. Hydroregime scenarios for coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch (Walbaum, 1792), were investigated in Washington and Oregon, USA, where long‐term records of discharge, water temperature, and upstream fish passage are available. This novel approach combines hydrological and ecological data in a single visualization, providing empirical foundations for understanding upstream behavioural movement and tolerances of native fishes. 4. The timing of coho salmon movement with respect to temperature and discharge were compared with scenarios representing possible future hydrological conditions associated with a changing climate. 5. This approach provides a framework for the study of future hydrological alterations in other locations, and can inform local and regional conservation planning, particularly in view of water management policy.

Despite this, extreme water levels are typically modeled in isolated open coast or estuarine environments, potentially mischaracterizi​ng the true risk of flooding facing coastal communities. This paper explores the variability of extreme water levels near the tribal community of La Push, within the Quileute Indian Reservation on the Washington state coast, where a river signal is apparent in tide gauge measurements during high discharge events. To estimate the influence of multiple forcings on high water levels a hybrid modeling framework is developed, where probabilistic simulations of joint still water level and river discharge occurrences are merged with a hydraulic model that simulates along-river water levels. This methodology produces along-river water levels from thousands of combinations of events not necessarily captured in the observational records. We show that the 100-year still water level event and the 100-year discharge event do not always produce the 100-year along-river water level. Furthermore, along specific sections of river, both still water level and discharge are necessary for producing the 100-year along river water level. Understanding the relative forcing driving extreme water levels along an ocean-to-river gradient will help communities within inlets better understand their risk to the compounding impacts of various environmental forcing, which is important for increasing their resilience to future flooding events.","Serafin, Katherine A.;Ruggiero, Peter;Parker, Kai;Hill, David F.",ORESU-R-19-009,ORESU-R-19-009,E/INT-143 E/A-16,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,What's streamflow got to do with it?

Consumption of juvenile “seed clams” forces aquaculturists to try to exclude predators and/or raise juveniles in hatcheries  until they can reach a size refuge. We ran a variety of lab experiments  assessing vulnerabilities of juvenile clams to small, common shore crabs (Hemigrapsus spp.). Crabs <1 cm width can consume hardshell Manila clams larger than those normally used for “seed”, and can readily crush even larger softshell Mya  clams. We suggest that using netting to prevent consumption by shore crabs is not practical given that smaller individuals can fit through mesh openings. Raising seed in hatcheries until they are 10–15 mm will provide a size refuge from shore crabs, but not larger cancrid crabs. Farming on beaches with little habitat (e.g., cobbles) for shore crabs can likely reduce juvenile clam mortality.

Standard operations in shellfish aquaculture begin at a hatchery where adults are spawned and larvae are reared (figure 1). Early-life stages have an elevated sensitivity to unfavorable. conditions (e.g. diet, seawater chemistry, etc.) and pose a production limitation. A successful hatchery is largely dependent on accurate counts of phytoplankton batch cultures to estimate daily feeding routines, optimize shellfish production, and avoid sub-lethal harm during life-stages susceptible to overfeeding or starvation (figure 2).

The Pacific coastline, however, is also experiencing rapidly changing ocean habitat, including significant reductions in pH. To better understand the physiological impact of ocean acidification on geoduck clams, we characterized for the first time the proteomic profile of this bivalve during larval development and compared it to that of larvae exposed to low pH conditions. Geoduck larvae were reared at pH 7.5 (ambient) or pH 7.1 in a commercial shellfish hatchery from day 6 to day 19 postfertilizati​on and sampled at six time points for an in‐depth proteomics analysis using high‐resolution data‐dependent analysis. Larvae reared at low pH were smaller than those reared at ambient pH, especially in the prodissoconch II phase of development, and displayed a delay in their competency for settlement. Proteomic profiles revealed that metabolic, cell cycle, and protein turnover pathways differed between the two pH and suggested that differing phenotypic outcomes between pH 7.5 and 7.1 are likely due to environmental disruptions to the timing of physiological events. In summary, ocean acidification results in elevated energetic demand on geoduck larvae, resulting in delayed development and disruptions to normal molecular developmental pathways, such as carbohydrate metabolism, cell growth, and protein synthesis.","Timmins-​Schiffman, Emma;Guzman, Jose M.;Elliott Thompson, Rhonda;Vadopalas, Brent;Eudeline, Benoit;Roberts, Steven B.",WASHU-R-19-005,WSG-TA 19-03,A/ACE-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,Washington Sea Grant,Dynamic response in the larval geoduck (Panopea generosa) proteome to elevated pCO2,"Ecology and Evolution, 10(1): 185-197, January 2020; First published December 2019",10.1002/ece3.58​85,NA,Open access,NA,NA14OAR4170078

A comprehensive understanding of how organisms will respond to these complex environmental changes can come only from observing and studying species within their natural environment. To this end, the effects of environmental drivers—pH, dissolved oxygen content, salinity, and temperature—on Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas physiology were evaluated in an outplant experiment. Sibling juvenile oysters were outplanted to eelgrass and unvegetated habitat at 5 different estuarine sites within the Acidification Nearshore Monitoring Network in Washington State, USA, to evaluate how regional environmental drivers influence molecular physiology. Within each site, we also determined if eelgrass presence, which buffered pH conditions, changed the oysters’ expressed proteome. A novel, 2-step, gel-free proteomic approach was used to identify differences in protein abundance in C. gigas ctenidia tissue after a 29 d outplant by (1) identifying proteins in a data-​independent acquisition survey step and (2) comparing relative quantities of targeted environmental response proteins using selected reaction monitoring. While there was no difference in protein abundance detected between habitats or among sites within Puget Sound, C. gigas outplanted at Willapa Bay had significantly higher abundances of antioxidant enzymes and molecular chaperones. Environmental factors at Willapa Bay, such as higher average temperature, may have driven this protein abundance pattern.

The new program became the NASEM’s Gulf Research Program (GRP), “an independent, science-based program that funds studies, projects, and other activities in the areas of research and development, education and capacity building, and monitoring and synthesis” (NASEM GRP, 2019). Activities focus on the transfer of knowledge within the Gulf of Mexico region and other U.S. regions where human communities, ecosystems, and energy production coexist. Furthermore, GRP’s Thriving Communities Initiative “seeks to improve the quality, accessibility, and use of information about how to protect communities from the impacts of oil spills” (NASEM GRP, 2019). For more information about the GRP, visit www.nationalaca​demies.org/gulf​. In 2017, GRP and the Health and Medical Division of NASEM hosted a workshop in Washington D.C. titled “Preparing for a rapid response to major marine oil spills: Protecting and assessing the health and well-being of communities” (Giammaria, Nicholson, & Snair, 2018). The workshop participants discussed research opportunities for improving public health preparedness, response, and protection associated with oil spills. They identified potential challenges and opportunities for communities to support preparedness and resiliency after a spill and recommended that GRP gather input at the local level.To address the need for local-level input and other recommendations identified in the August 2017 workshop, GRP collaborated with seven of the 34 Sea Grant college programs via the Gulf of Mexico Sea Grant Oil Spill Science Outreach Program. The outreach program’s team is comprised of staff from the Florida Sea Grant College Program, Louisiana Sea Grant College Program, Mississippi-​Alabama Sea Grant Consortium, and Texas Sea Grant College Program. They focus on synthesizing, translating, and delivering peer-reviewed oil spill science information for people whose livelihoods depend on healthy natural resources. With support from the GRP as well as the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative, the team led two workshops in the Gulf of Mexico region and partnered with the Alaska Sea Grant College Program, University of Southern California Sea Grant Institutional Program, and Virginia Sea Grant College Program to lead regional workshops in their locations. The goal was to gather feedback at the local and regional levels to identify opportunities to improve preparedness for oil spills. The five regions identified for this national collaborative effort—the West Coast, mid-Atlantic, Alaska, and eastern and western Gulf of Mexico—are all home to communities that have been impacted by oil spills. One workshop was planned for each region, focusing on three broadly defined topical areas—minimizin​g health, social, and economic disruptions after oil spills.","Hale, C.;Covi, M.;Holen, D.;Partyka, M.;Schulhof, M.;Sempier, S.;Skelton, T.",GOMSG-W-19-002,GOMSG-W-19-002,NA,conference/work​shop proceedings,2019,NA,Gulf of Mexico Sea Grant,"Regional Priority-​Setting to Minimize Health, Social, and Economic Disruptions from Oil Spills: A Summary Report as part of the National Academies and Sea Grant Collaborative Workshop Series","Based on a series of the following collaborative workshops: Western Gulf of Mexico Regional Workshop, December 4-5, 2018, Houma, Louisiana; Alaska Regional Workshop, February 20-21, 2019, Anchorage, Alaska; Mid-Atlantic Regional Workshop, March 29, 2019, Virginia Beach, Virginia; West Coast Regional Workshop, April 5, 2019, Santa Barbara, California; and Eastern Gulf of Mexico Regional Workshop, May 6-7, 2019, Mobile and Bayou La Batre, Alabama.",NA,NA,Oil Spill Science: Sea Grant Programs of the Gulf of Mexico series,NA,NA

Rarely has the importance of these factors been tested concurrently in the field. Our study spanned three spatial scales in estuarine waters of Washington state (Region: north vs. south; Within-region: fresher vs. saline; Within-site: mid- vs. low-tidal elevation). Predator access and sediment conditions were manipulated in a crossed experimental design, with juvenile (3-mm and 6-mm) Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) outplanted in open- or closed-top mesh tubes. We found differences between treatments that appeared only at sites with cancrid crabs, suggesting that predators, rather than emigration, likely reduced numbers of clams in open tubes. We had hypothesized that clams at lower tidal elevations, which experience longer immersion times, would show improved growth but reduced survivorship because of greater exposure to marine predators. However, these patterns were evident at only one of three sites (lower-​elevation treatments were lost at the fourth). The larger size class of clams was more tolerant of abiotic stressors at all sites, but the magnitude of difference in survival between size classes was sometimes dependent on other treatments. The maximum predator effect on survival was 74% (north, high salinity, low-intertidal site), whereas the maximum abiotic effect appeared as 62% lower survival and 59% slower growth for 3-mm clams at another site (north, fresher). In laboratory trials, high water temperatures (28–32 °C) and low salinity (5–15) acted synergistically to cause juvenile clam (6–12 mm) mortality, whereas clams tolerated each of these stressors alone. Context-​dependence in the relative importance of predation and abiotic stressors was apparent in our results, but contrary to expectations, abiotic stressors did not characterize southern or fresher sites. Instead, extreme high temperatures occurred at the site with the wide tidal flat rather than in the south, and the within-region salinity differences appeared not to exceed tolerances of juvenile clams.","Dethier, Megan N.;Kobelt, Julia;Yiu, Dara;Wentzel, Lindsay;Ruesink, Jennifer L.",WASHU-R-19-008,WSG-TA 19-01,R/SFA-6,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Elsevier,Washington Sea Grant,Context-​dependence of abiotic and biotic factors influencing performance of juvenile clams,"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 219:201-209, April 2019",10.1016/j.ecss.​2019.02.013,NA,NA,NA,NA14OAR4170078

This spatio-temporal pattern emerged because most eelgrass-​associated taxa tracked the decline in eelgrass biomass from summer to spring, but in one case reached greater density in spring when predation intensity was low. Among 21 taxa (26,884 individuals) captured, a strong correlation arose between structure association and summer dominance, and certain functional traits, in particular morphology and on- vs. off-bottom position, were strong predictors of eelgrass association. Structure-​associated taxa were slender-bodied and pelagic schooling fishes, while habitat generalists or bare-associated taxa were more consistent seasonally, primarily benthic, and cryptically colored with sand. Estuarine use (transient, reproducing, or estuarine resident) was not a strong predictor of structure associa-tion or seasonality. Because an identical sampling design was used in five regions of Washington State, USA, coarse-scale (> 100 km) differentiation in nekton assemblages was identified, representing less of the total variation than across seasons but more than across different habitats. While regional nekton differences were attributable in part to geographic distance and eelgrass morphotypes, the most seasonally variable nekton were at sites with morphotypes adding the least vertical structure but highest density. These results support two mechanisms that increase seasonal variability of taxa using structured habitats, including both bottom-up provision of habitat and resources, and subsequent possibilities for negative interspecific interactions and top-down control.","Ruesink, J.L.;Gross, C.;Pruitt, C.;Trimble, A.C.;Donoghue, C.",WASHU-R-19-009,WSG-TA 19-02,R/HCE-14,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Springer,Washington Sea Grant,Habitat structure influences the seasonality of nekton in seagrass,"Marine Biology, 166: Article 75, May 2019",10.1007/s00227-​019-​3519-​z,NA,Open access,NA,NA14OAR4170078

In Washington State, USA, eelgrass (Zostera marina) occurs under two distinct shoreline slope conditions: shallow tidal flats where eelgrass forms extensive meadows, and steep slopes near channels where it forms narrow, often patchy, fringes adjacent to unvegetated sediment. We sampled nekton in these naturally occurring habitat mosaics with a crossed design: unvegetated, edge, and interior eelgrass (habitat) in flats and fringes. Multivariate community structure showed additive effects of habitat and slope, while aggregate body size did not vary across habitat, shoot density, or slopes. Total nekton abundance responded to structure on fringes (interior > unvegetated; edge = unvegetated; and interior > edge) but not on flats, while half of the most common taxa showed a significant habitat-​by-​slope interaction in abundance. Diversity and species richness were greater in fringes than flats, irrespective of habitat type. Since canopy height and shoot density did not differ significantly between fringes and flats, it is unlikely that fine-scale aspects of vegetation structure explain why fauna responded differently to eelgrass fringes and flats. We instead attribute these different responses to underlying differences between fringes and flats in within-habitat heterogeneity and connectivity to deeper habitats, as well as species-​specific responses to greater edge/interior ratios in fringing beds. Our study shows that topographic and seascape heterogeneity as well as habitat connectivity may play key roles in the value of nearshore estuarine habitats for nekton in the Northeast Pacific.","Gross, Collin;Donoghue, Cinde;Pruitt, Casey;Trimble, Alan C.;Ruesink, Jennifer L.",WASHU-R-19-010,WSG-TA 19-06,R/HCE-14,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Springer,Washington Sea Grant,Nekton community responses to seagrass differ with shoreline slope,"Journal of the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation, 42:1156–1168, April 2019",10.1007/s12237-​019-​00556-​8,NA,NA,NA,NA14OAR4170078

Based on seines in eelgrass (Zostera marina), unvegetated habitat, and edges in Willapa Bay, Washington, USA, nekton abundances varied across habitats and on both diel and seasonal time scales, yet only a few time-by-habitat interactions were observed, in which habitat distinctions were most pronounced at certain times. One explanation is that four of the six most abundant species disproportionat​ely occupied unvegetated habitat or were habitat generalists, but our expectations were based on eelgrass-​associated taxa. Multivariate community structure responded separately to season, habitat, and diel period, in order of importance. Total abundance showed a significant season-​by-​habitat interaction. A summer peak in vegetated habitats was largely driven by shiner perch and sticklebacks, two eelgrass-​associated fishes, while unvegetated habitat showed year-round uniform abundances due to taxa like English sole and sand shrimp with winter and spring peaks, and no strong habitat associations or association with unvegetated habitat, respectively. In a single diel-by-habitat interaction, shiner perch were eelgrass-​associated during the day but not at night. No evidence emerged of differences in body size across habitats for any species measured, but many taxa grew seasonally, likely as cohorts migrating out of the estuary. Seasonality was thus the strongest signal governing patterns of community structure, abundance, and body size across time and space, while habitat structure and diel period were less important. Our results are largely consistent with the other studies showing the primacy of seasonality in structuring estuarine nekton communities, but also show that this pattern is highly dependent on the seasonal recruitment patterns and habitat associations of abundant nekton.","Gross, Collin;Ruesink, Jennifer L.;Pruitt, Casey;Trimble, Alan C.;Donoghue, Cinde",WASHU-R-19-011,WSG-TA 19-05,R/HCE-14,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,Elsevier B.V.,Washington Sea Grant,Temporal variation in intertidal habitat use by nekton at seasonal and diel scales,"Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 516:25-​34, July 2019",10.1016/j.jembe​.2019.04.009,NA,NA,NA,NA14OAR4170078

These ecological subsidies can have substantial effects on community structure, function, and services, especially when the connections are between communities with contrasting productivity. At the ocean-land interface, low productivity coastal beaches and dunes are regularly exposed to subsidies from the ocean. These marine subsidies likely provide an important nutrient source for dune vegetation that might otherwise be nutrient-​limited. Given that dune vegetation plays a key role in dune formation and stabilization, it is imperative to understand the role of marine subsidies to the nutrient dynamics and plant productivity patterns of these coastal systems. In this dissertation, I investigate the role of marine subsidies to dune  ecosystem functions from local to meta-ecosystem scales along the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast. Coastal beaches and dunes make up approximately  45% of the Oregon and Washington coasts and are adjacent to many highly  productive estuaries and rocky reefs. The plant communities at these sites experience variable ocean productivity, marine subsidies, and coastal sediment supply. The most common plant species are two non-native invasive grasses, the European beachgrass, Ammophila arenaria, and the American beachgrass, Ammophila breviligulata. Since their introduction in the early 1900’s, the Ammophila congeners have spread and rapidly transformed what was once an open, shifting, and sparsely vegetated habitat into one with continuous, stable, and densely  vegetated foredunes. Despite this ecosystem-level transformation over the last century, little is known about the role of marine subsidies to the nutrient dynamics and primary production of dune grass communities. Here I use a combination of observations, laboratory analyses, and experiments to understand the role of ecological subsidies to dune grass  production at local to regional scales along the U.S. Pacific Northwest  coast. In Chapter 2, I explore the role of marine subsidies to dune grass production at 15 dune-backed beach sites in Washington and Oregon and over three years (2015-2017). Specifically, I ask 1) Is there a relationship between ocean upwelling, distance to wrack source habitat, and beach width to macrophyte wrack amount and composition across large regional (meta-​ecosystem) spatial scales and over time (2015-2017)?, 2) Is there a relationship between ocean upwelling, sand supply, and/or marine macrophyte wrack and the marine nutrient dynamics at local and regional scales and over time?, and 3) Is there a relationship between marine nutrients and dune grass production at local to regional spatial scales and over time? I provide evidence that marine subsidies are common and predictable sources of nutrients to these beaches and dunes and that they influence dune grass ecosystems in significant ways. Specifically, I found that macrophyte wrack and sand nitrates, which were positively related to ocean upwelling and sand supply, were important determinants of dune grass production across sites and foredune profile locations. Beaches with more macrophyte wrack and greater sand supply had greater dune grass shoot density and biomass, especially at the toe of the dune where sand nitrate concentrations were  high. Beaches with lower macrophyte wrack and sand supply had greater shoot density and biomass of dune grasses at the crest of the dune, where sand deposition and nitrate concentrations were high. Taken together, these results suggest that marine subsidies are important contributors to the nutrient dynamics and productivity of dune grasses, potentially influencing the sand capture and dune building capabilities of these ecosystem engineering grass species. In Chapter 3, I determine whether dune plant species in the U.S. Pacific Northwest use marine subsidies, and if so, how this use varies at local to regional spatial scales. In particular, I ask 1) Does the amount (%N) and marine source (δ15N) of nitrogen in four dune plant species (two non-native invasive beachgrass species Ammophila arenaria and A. breviligulata, the native dune grass, Elymus mollis, and the native shrub Cakile edentula) vary across sites (coast-scale) and foredune profile locations (dune-scale)? and 2) Does the amount (%N) and marine source (δ15N) of nitrogen of beachgrasses correlate with measures of marine subsidies (macrophyte wrack and sand nitrates) and/or beach and foredune geomorphology (beach width and foredune crest height) on coastal foredunes? I found that marine nutrients were an important source of nitrogen for dune plants in  the U.S. Pacific Northwest, and that the amount and source of nitrogen in these plants varied among species, sites, and foredune profile locations. Regression analyses showed that, for the most part, macrophyte wrack biomass and sand nitrate concentrations were unrelated to %N or δ15N of the grasses. However, I did find that wider beaches and  shorter foredunes had beachgrasses with slightly lower %N tissue content across foredune profile locations but the source of that nitrogen at the crest and heel had a higher marine signature. The results presented in this chapter corroborate earlier studies that beach  nutrients, especially those with marine origin, are an important source  of nitrogen for foredune plants. Finally, in Chapter 4, I test whether beachgrasses in the U.S. Pacific Northwest are nutrient limited and whether this potential limitation varies along foredune profile locations and sites with different sand nitrate conditions. Specifically, I used two manipulative experiments to ask: (1) How does nutrient addition affect dune grass production at sites and foredune profile locations that vary in natural sand nitrate concentrations? and (2) Does dune grass production and plant tissue elemental composition vary with increasing nitrogen additions and do dune grasses experience nitrogen and phosphorous co-limitation? I found that dune grasses were nutrient-​limited, with nutrient additions positively affecting dune grass production at sites and foredune profile locations that have higher wrack deposition and background sand nitrate concentrations. I also found that increased nitrogen and phosphorous increased grass shoot  density, total biomass, and plant tissue %N. However, grass shoot biomass and shoot length either did not change, or declined, with phosphorus additions suggesting that there was no phosphorus co-​limitation. These results suggest that U.S. Pacific Northwest dune grasses are nutrient limited, especially at the foredune crest and heel,  where background sand nitrate concentrations are lower. In summary, my dissertation fills a critical gap in our understanding of beach and dune  nutrient dynamics and the role of nutrients to coastal dune plant community production from a meta-ecosystem perspective. By considering local and regional relationships, this meta-ecosystem approach provides an ideal framework to understanding the role of marine subsidies to dune  grass production. This approach also allows us to better understand how  coastal dune systems might change under varying climate so that we may better manage their functions and services in the future.","Constant, Vanessa",ORESU-Y-19-004,ORESU-Y-19-004,NA,theses/disserta​tions,2019,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,Coastal Dunes as Meta-​Ecosystems: Connecting Marine Subsidies to Dune Ecosystem Functions on the U.S. Pacific Northwest Coast,NA,NA,https://ir.libr​ary.oregonstate​.edu/concern/gr​aduate_thesis_o​r_dissertations​/q524jv90x?loca​le=en,"This thesis was for a doctorate in Integrative Biology at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon",NA,NA14OAR4170064

Consequently, it is necessary to understand the differing elements of such state rules, as they can greatly impact the potential success of a commercial seaweed aquaculture operation. In response to this need, the National Sea Grant Law Center (NSGLC) conducted an inventory of applicable statutes and regulations in states that either currently permit commercial seaweed aquaculture or have taken steps to facilitate such in the future. In creating this report, the National Sea Grant Law Center identified eleven states with potentially applicable statutes and regulations—Ala​ska, California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington.

This report does not list every potentially applicable rule, but instead includes those most relevant due to their scope, content, and/or applicability.

Here, we used contaminated and clean Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) samples to test (a) the efficacy of bleach decontamination​, (b) the effect of decontamination on RAD genotypes and (c) the consequences of contaminated samples on population genetic analyses. We collected fin tissue samples from actively spawning (and thus contaminated) wild herring and nonspawning (uncontaminated​) herring. Samples were soaked for 10 min in bleach or left untreated, and extracted DNA was used to prepare DNA libraries using a restriction site‐associated DNA (RAD) approach. Our results demonstrate that intraspecific DNA contamination affects patterns of individual and population variability, causes an excess of heterozygotes and biases estimates of population structure. Bleach decontamination was effective at removing intraspecific DNA contamination and compatible with RAD sequencing, producing high‐quality sequences, reproducible genotypes and low levels of missing data. Although sperm contamination may be specific to broadcast spawners, intraspecific contamination of samples may be common and difficult to detect from high‐throughput sequencing data and can impact downstream analyses.","Petrou, Eleni L.;Drinan, Daniel P.;Kopperl, Robert;Lepofsky, Dana;Yang, Dongya;Moss, Madonna L.;Hauser, Lorenz",WASHU-R-19-012,WSG-TA 19-07,R/HCE-3,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,Washington Sea Grant,Intraspecific DNA contamination distorts subtle population structure in a marine fish: Decontamination of herring samples before restriction‐sit​e associated sequencing and its effects on population genetic statistics,"Molecular Ecology Resources, 19(5): 1131-1143, September 2019",10.1111/1755-​0998.12978,NA,NA,NA,NA14OAR4170078

Recent declines in salmon abundance have raised questions of whether managersshould mitigate for losses of salmon MDN subsidies. To test the long-term importance of salmon subsidiesto riparian ecosystems, we measured soil nitrogen cycling in response to a 20-yr manipulation where salmon carcasses were systematically removed from one bank and deposited on the opposite bank along a 2-km stream in southwestern Alaska. Soil samples were taken at different distances from the stream bankalong nine paired transects and measured for organic and inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and nitrogentransfo​rmation rates. Marine-derived nitrogen was measured using 15N/14N for bulk soils, and NHþ4 andNO3 soil pools. Stable isotope analyses confirmed 15N/14N was elevated on the salmon-enhanced bankcompared to the salmon-depleted bank. However, 15N/14N values of plant-available inorganic nitrogenexceede​d the 15N/14N of salmon inputs, highlighting nitrogen isotope fractionation in soils that raises significant methodological issues with standard MDN assessments in riparian systems. Surprisingly, despite20 yr of salmon supplementation​, the presence of MDN did not cause a long-term increase in soil nitrogenavailab​ility. This finding indicates the importance of MDN to ecosystem nitrogen biogeochemistry​, andriparian vegetation may be overestimated for some systems. Given that essential nutrients can also be pollutants, we urge more critical analyses of the role of MDN to inform compensatory mitigation programstargeti​ng salmon nutrient enhancement.","Feddern, Megan L.;Holtgrieve, Gordon W.;Perakis, Steven S.;Hart, Julia;Ro, Hyejoo;Quinn, Thomas P.",WASHU-R-19-013,WSG-TA 19-08,R/HCE-18,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Riparian soil nitrogen cycling and isotopic enrichment in response to a long-term salmon carcass manipulation experiment,"Ecosphere, 10(1​1): e02958, 1-16, November 2019",10.1002/ecs2.29​58,NA,Open access article,NA,NA

The creation of these markets requires developing the institutional capacity to disseminate market information in order for the market to achieve those goals more effectively. This dissertation draws on prior work regarding network information diffusion to examine the ways in which information brokers affect market function and outcomes in management and policy contexts. The first two chapters focus on the U.S. municipal bond market, which serves as the management context, and uses data on all U.S. municipal bond issues for 2004-2016. The first chapter develops a measure of network connectivity for financial advisors in the market, and shows through linear models under nearest-​neighbor matching that these highly connected advisors are associated with reduced interest costs for local governments. The second chapter uses a choice model under state dependence to estimate how local governments' past advisor choices implicitly constrain their future choice sets. The results suggest state dependence could increase interest costs for local governments, particularly for those that have contracted with only one or two advisors in the past. Alaska halibut and sablefish individual quota fisheries serve as the policy context for chapters 3 and 4 with confidential quota transaction data from AKFIN as the primary data source. In chapter 3, network model simulation shows that quota brokers help traders access the broader market by trading outside of their immediate social network compared to trading without a broker, though there still exists some relationship between traders' social networks and trading patterns even for brokered trades. Brokers are also shown to increase sales price across many quota sub-markets. Chapter 4 develops a novel choice-based method for estimating willingness-​to-​pay for quota among subgroups. This method is then applied this model within a regression discontinuity design to test how a recent policy change affected resource valuation among key subgroups of interest.","Hayes, Adam L.",WASHU-Y-19-001,WSG-TH 19-01,R/E/I-30,theses/disserta​tions,2019,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Four Essays on Decentralized Markets in Management and Policy,NA,NA,NA,For the degree of Doctor of Philosophy,NA,NA

Macroalgae, the primary habitat-forming species in the nearshore, disappeared from the region. It was hypothesized that this mortality event was caused by a reduction in benthic light availability due to increased turbidity. To investigate this connection, nearshore processes and benthic light availability were monitored at 7 locations along the 10-m isobath in 2016 and 2017. The primary driver of light attenuation was suspended sediment, with measured chlorophyll-a and CDOM concentrations contributing <15% to observed attenuation values. A Bootstrap-​aggregated Regression Tree was trained to predict attenuation from the in-situ data. Light attenuation was impacted by both sediment transport in the river plume, represented in the model by fluvial suspended-​sediment load and tidal-current direction, and subsurface resuspension, represented by wave height and bed shear velocity. The models were used to hindcast to light availability during the dam removal. Total daily benthic light availability was below the 1–2 mol photons/m2/day threshold for macroalgae growth consistently in 2013 and seasonally in 2012 and 2014, supporting the hypothesis that reduced light availability caused the mortality event. Light availability increased in 2016–2017 as the annual sediment load decreased, and macroalgae were concurrently observed in the region. Predicting benthic light availability over event, tidal, and seasonal timescales by accounting for both near-surface and subsurface attenuation will improve management strategies designed to limit ecosystem damage during sediment-​delivery events.","Glover, H.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’​s West Hawai‘i Integrated Ecosystem Assessment, a program grounded in ecosystem-based management, recognizes the importance of place-based human dimensions in coastal and marine resource management that speak to a fuller range of social and cultural dimensions of ecosystem-based management. Previous work with stakeholders in West Hawai‘i revealed noteworthy SES dynamics and highlighted both the importance and lack of understanding of the links between ecosystem services and human well-being, particularly services that enhance and maintain active cultural connections to a place. While cultural ecosystem services and human well-being are often recognized as important elements of SES, there have been substantial barriers to fully representing them, likely due to perceived difficulties of measuring non-material benefits and values, many of which are socially constructed and subjective. This study examined SES frameworks related to cultural ecosystem services and human well-being to advance the representation and operationalizat​ion of these important concepts in coastal and marine management. We describe key insights and questions focused on: (1) points of inclusion for human dimensions in SES models, (2) culturally relevant domains of human well-being and related indicators, (3) the importance of place and its interaction with scale, and finally (4) the tension between a gestalt vs. discrete approach to modeling, assessing, and sustainably managing social-​ecological systems.","Leong, Kirsten M.;Wongbusarakum, ​Supin;Ingram, Rebecca J.;Mawyer, Alexand​er;Poe, Melissa R.",WASHU-R-19-016,WSG-TA 19-12,A/ACE-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Improving Representation of Human Well-Being and Cultural Importance in Conceptualizing the West Hawai‘i Ecosystem,"Frontiers in Marine Science, 6: Article 231:1-13, May 2019",10.3389/fmars.2​019.00231,NA,Open access,NA,NA

Spatial measures (e.g. area‐based closures) may achieve some objectives but produce alternative trade‐offs that are sensitive to assumptions about fish population dynamics and social complexities.

As a result, conservation and resource management increasingly look to factor in potential interactions among the social, ecological and economic components of these systems. Investigation of these interactions requires interdisciplina​ry frameworks that incorporate methods and insights from across the social and biophysical sciences. Risk assessment methods, which have been developed across numerous disciplines and applied to various real-world settings and problems, provide a unique connection point for cross-​disciplinary engagement. However, research on risk is often conducted in distinct spheres by experts whose focus is on narrow sources or outcomes of risk. Movement toward a more integrated treatment of risk to ensure a balanced approach to developing and managing ocean resources requires cross-​disciplinary engagement and understanding. Here, we provide a primer on risk assessment intended to encourage the development and implementation of integrated risk assessment processes in the emerging blue economy. First, we summarize the dominant framework for risk in the ecological/biop​hysical sciences. Then, we discuss six key insights from the long history of risk research in the social sciences that can inform integrated assessments of risk: (1) consider the subjective nature of risk, (2) understand individual social and cultural influences on risk perceptions, (3) include diverse expertise, (4) consider the social scales of analysis, (5) incorporate quantitative and qualitative approaches, and (6) understand interactions and feedbacks within systems. Finally, we show how these insights can be incorporated into risk assessment and management, and apply them to a case study of whale entanglements in fishing gear off the United States west coast.","Hodgson, Emma E.;Essington, Timothy E.;Samhouri, Jameal F.;Allison, Edward H.;Bennett, Nathan J.;Bostrom, Ann;Cullen Alison C.;Kasperski, Stephen;Levin, Phillip S.;Poe, Melissa R.",WASHU-R-19-018,WSG-TA 19-15,A/ACE-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Integrated Risk Assessment for the Blue Economy,"Frontiers in Marine Science, 6: Article 609, September 26, 2019",10.3389/fmars.2​019.00609,NA,Open access,NA,NA

These changes can have important implications for marine ecosystems, creating risk for commercial industries, subsistence communities, cultural practices, and recreation. Characterizing the extent of acidification and predicting the ramifications for marine and freshwater resources and ecosystem services are critical to national and international climate mitigation discussions and to local communities that rely on these resources. Based on critical grassroots connections between scientists, stakeholders and decision makers, “Knowledge-​to-​Action” networks for ocean acidification issues have formed at local, regional and international scales to take action. Here, we review three examples of North American groups elevating the issue of ocean acidification at these three levels. They each focus on developing practicable, implementable steps to mitigate causes, to adapt to unavoidable change, and to build resilience to changing ocean conditions in the marine environment and coastal communities. While these first steps represent critical efforts in protecting ecosystems and economies from the risks posed by ocean acidification, some challenges remain. Sensitivity and risk to OA varies by region, species and ecosystems; priorities for action can vary between multiple and conflicting partners; evidence-based strategies for OA risk mitigation are still in the early stages; and gaps remain between scientific research and actionable decision-maker support products. However, the scaled networks profiled here have proven to be adept at identifying and addressing these barriers to action. In the future, it will be critical to expand funding for food web impact studies and development of decision support tools, and to maintain the connections between scientists and marine resource users to build resilience to ocean acidification impacts.","Cross, Jessica N.;Turner, Jessie A.;Cooley, Sarah R.;Newton, Jan A.;Azetsu-Scott, Kumiko;Chambers, R.

For sediment-​starved and erosion-prone coasts, large-scale enhancement of sediment supply may be an important, but poorly understood, management option. Here we provide new topographic measurements that show patterns and trends of beach accretion following the restoration of sediment supply from a massive dam removal project. River sediment was initially deposited in intertidal-​to-​subtidal deltaic lobes, and this sediment was reworked by ocean waves into subaerial river mouth bars over time scales of several months. These river mouth bars welded to the shoreline and then initiated waves of sediment accretion along adjacent upcoast and downcoast beaches. Although the downcoast shoreline has a high wave-angle setting, the sedimentation waves straightened the downcoast shoreline rather than forming self-organized quasi-periodic instabilities, which suggests that simple coastal evolution theory did not hold under these conditions.

However, associated genetic changes may decrease restoration success and negatively affect the adaptive potential of the entire population. Thus, approaches that minimize genetic risks should be tested in a comparative framework over multiple generations. Genetic diversity in two captive-reared lines of a species of conservation interest, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), was surveyed across three generations using genome-wide approaches. Genetic divergence from the source population was minimal in an integrated line, which implemented managed gene flow by using only naturally-born adults as captive broodstock, but significant in a segregated line, which bred only captive-origin individuals. Estimates of effective number of breeders revealed that the rapid divergence observed in the latter was largely attributable to genetic drift. Three independent tests for signatures of adaptive divergence also identified temporal change within the segregated line, possibly indicating domestication selection. The results empirically demonstrate that using managed gene flow for propagating a captive-reared population reduces genetic divergence over the short term compared to one that relies solely on captive-​origin parents. These findings complement existing studies of captive breeding, which typically focus on a single management strategy and examine the fitness of one or two generations.","Waters, Charles D.",WASHU-Y-18-001,WSG-TH 19-02,R/E/I-26,theses/disserta​tions,2018,Washington Sea Grant,Washington Sea Grant,Effectiveness of managed gene flow to reduce genetic and phenotypic change associated with captive breeding of Chinook salmon,NA,NA,https://digital​.lib.washington​.edu/researchwo​rks/handle/1773​/42358,"For the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, University of Washington",NA,NA
/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-wa-csv/22588296_1138_2818175.csv,8,"Rationale: Fisheries management is predicated on surveys that monitor changes in population levels. Biased and imprecise surveys can lead to uncertain population estimates that can complicate management strategies. In some cases, only fishery-​dependent data are available which require standardization to account for changes in catch per unit effort (CPUE) unrelated to fish abundance (Maunder and Punt 2004). Standardization of fishery-​independent survey data is often necessary as well, particularly for design-based surveys. Surveys that miss key habitats, such as rocky reefs that cannot be trawled, and deep waters beyond the reach of a survey, increase the potential for biased estimates of relative abundance and raise concerns about the magnitude of biomass that may be cryptic to standard surveys. Bias correction is difficult with inconsistently biased CPUE indices and will result in biased population assessments.;Objectives: We designed a simulation framework to evaluate bias and imprecision from density-​based sampling and gear saturation and assess their impact on the relationship between survey CPUE and relative abundance. Several of the simulation parameters and assumptions are informed by a case study, the Southern California Shelf Rockfish Hook and Line Survey (hereafter, “California hook-​and-​line survey”) which targets several demersal species of the genus Sebastes in rocky habitats in the Southern California Bight. Simulation characteristics such as survey design; number of sites; number of hooks deployed; population sizes aimed at reflecting overfished, rebuilding, and rebuilt stocks; and exploration of how multi-species competition interacts with gear saturation were included to improve the analysis of data collected on the California hookand-line survey but also provide useful insight for more generalized applications (Cadigan 2012). We conclude the analysis by comparing simulation results with empirical data collected on this survey.","Kuriyama, Peter",WASHU-S-19-002,WSG-AS 19-13,R/E/I-23,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2019,Washington Sea Grant,Washington Sea Grant,Integrating hook and line survey data and ecological observations to improve stock assessments of key rockfish species in untrawlable habitats (Final narrative report),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-wa-csv/22588314_289_2817326.csv,128,"Introduction: Overfishing and overcapitalizat​ion have been prominent challenges in the West Coast Groundfish fishery as managers strive to maintain a viable, profitable, and efficient groundfish fishery (Pacific Fishery Management Council and NMFS 2010). The fishery spans the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington and includes about 90 species, many of which are long- lived, slow-growing, and late-to-mature. Management is complicated by multiple species living in the same areas, so that reducing catch limits of one species will indirectly limit catches of another species. Selectively targeting a species is particularly difficult with trawl gear. Taken together, these factors pose challenges to managers who strive to prevent overfishing of all species and reduce excess fishing capacity while maintaining an economically viable fishery.Overfis​hing occurred throughout much of the fishery’s history due to harvest targets that were set too high, further exacerbated by the short data series available for analysis and assessment following the rapid build up in many of these fisheries, relative to life histories of many rockfish (Sebastes spp.) that can live for many decades (Love et al. 1987; Cailliet et al. 2001). At that time, rockfish were thought to be shorter lived and more productive than they are in reality, and as a result, fishing mortality rates were set at unsustainable levels. Assessments in the mid-1990s found that some stocks were below 20% of unfished biomass (Ralston 2011), far below the target levels which were based on spawning potential ratios below 35% (Clark 1991) and then updated to 40% (Clark 1993). Target harvest rates were reduced, and landings declined to the point that the fishery was declared an economic disaster in 2000 (Shaw and Conway 2007; Hilborn et al. 2012). In 2002, the PFMC specified rebuilding plans for overfished species and greatly reduced target fishing mortality rates to as low as 0.8% for Pacific ocean perch (Pacific2 Fishery Management Council 2014). Rebuilding plans have been effective for most species, andseven of ten stocks have been declared rebuilt.;Abstract: Hook-and-line surveys can be used to estimate trends in the many fish species where more conventional methods such as trawl, acoustic, visual, or pot surveys cannot be applied. Hook-​and-​line surveys allow the collection of biological information including length, weight, age, and sexual maturity, but there are concerns about hook saturation, survey design, and the impact of competition among species on survey abundance estimates. We designed simulations to address these concerns and found hyperstability across all scenarios: catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined more slowly than population size. Despite hyperstability, the surveys still had statistical power to detect changes in abundance. Preferentially selecting sites with the most fish for survey sampling resulted in 45% stronger hyperstability but also a greater ability to detect changes in population size. When fish are distributed patchily, resulting in the most hyperstability,​ a decrease in relative abundance from 50% to 10% resulted in median CPUE values declining 28-35% when sampling preferentially and 11-12% when sampling randomly. Interspecies competition for hooks resulted in biased survey results when one species was more aggressive than another. Taken together, hook-and-line surveys offer a promising technique for species unsuited for other survey types.","Kuriyama, Peter T.",WASHU-Y-18-002,WSG-TH 19-03,R/E/1-23,theses/disserta​tions,2018,Washington Sea Grant,Washington Sea Grant,Multispecies Management and Assessment in the US West Coast Groundfish Fishery,NA,NA,https://digital​.lib.washington​.edu/researchwo​rks/bitstream/h​andle/1773/4179​4/Kuriyama_wash​ington_0250E_18​231.pdf?sequenc​e=1&isAllowed=y​,"For the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, University of Washington",NA,NA

However, these benefits may have costs, as consolidation and the potential for associated change in spatial distribution in landings can hinder social objectives such as maintaining access for fishery-​dependent communities and small owner-​operators. Achievement of such fishery management objectives are determined by changes in fisher behavior, which may be complex and difficult to predict. Predicting fisher behavior is particularly challenging in multispecies fisheries, in which the mix of species is a determinant of where and when fishing effort and landings occur. We evaluate changes in overall fishing effort, species targeting, and determinants of fishing location choice in response to catch shares in the US West Coast Groundfish Trawl Fishery. We found reductions in total fishing effort, increased targeting of some species, and no evidence of spatial effort concentration. Key determinants of location choice (distance, expected revenue, and recently fished locations) were similar among time periods, but after catch shares there was more avoidance of areas that lacked recent fishing activity or associated information with which to develop expectations of catch and bycatch. Additionally, location choice remained constant with up to 100-fold financial penalties on bycatch species.","Kuriyama, Peter T.;Holland, Daniel S.;Barnett, Lewis A.K.;Branch, Trevor A.;Hicks, Robert L.;Schnier, Kurt E.",WASHU-R-19-021,WSG-TA 19-20,R/E/I-23,reprints (peer-reviewed),2019,NRC Research Press,Washington Sea Grant,Catch shares drive fleet consolidation and increased targeting but not spatial effort concentration nor changes in location choice in a multispecies trawl fishery,"Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 76(12​): 2377-2389, December 2019",10.1139/cjfas-​2019-​0005,NA,NA,NA,NA15OAR4320063

Swash‐bar, foreshore and swale depositional elements are recognized within ground‐penetrat​ing radar profiles and sediment cores. A model for the growth and development of small mountainous river wave‐dominated deltas is proposed based on observation of both the fluvial and deltaic settings. If enough sediment is available in the fluvial system, mouth‐bars form after higher than average river discharge events, creating a large platform seaward of the subaqueous delta plain. Swash‐bars form concurrently or within a month of mouth‐bar deposition as a result of wave action. Fair‐weather waves drive swash‐bar migration landward and in the direction of littoral drift. The signature of swash‐bar welding to the shoreline is landward‐dippin​g reflections, as a result of overwash processes and slipface migration. However, most swash‐bars are eroded by the river mouth, as only 10 of the 37 swash‐bars that formed between August 2011 and July 2016 survived within the Elwha River delta. The swash‐bars that do survive either amalgamate onto the shoreline or an earlier deposited swash‐bar, forming a single larger barrier at the delta front. In asymmetrical deltas, the signature of swash‐bar welding is more likely to be preserved on the downdrift side of the delta, where formation is more likely and accommodation behind newer swash‐bars preserves older deposits. On small mountainous river deltas, welded swash‐bars may be more indicative of a large sediment pulse to the system, rather than large hydrological events.","Zurbuchen, Julie;Simms, Alexande​r R.;Warrick, Jonath​an A.;Miller, Ian M.;Ritchie, Andrew",WASHU-R-20-001,WSG-TA 19-17,A/ACE-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2020,The authors; The Journal of the International Association of Sedimentologist​s,Washington Sea Grant,"A model for the growth and development of wave-dominated deltas fed by small mountainous rivers: Insights from the Elwha River delta, Washington","Sedimentology, Article 12702, First published 3 January 2020; https://d​oi.org/10.1111/​sed.12702",10.1111/sed.127​02,NA,NA,NA,NA

This workshop, cohosted by NASEM’s Health and Medical Division, addressed public health issues surrounding oil spills, with an emphasis on preparedness, response, and lessons learned. Workshop participants discussed potential challenges communities might face, suggesting that input was needed at the regional level to determine opportunities for the GRP to support preparedness around the country (Giammaria, Nicholson, & Snair, 2018).  In late 2018 and 2019, GRP, the Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI), and multiple Sea Grant programs collaborated to host a series of workshops around the country focused on human dimensions of oil spill preparedness. The Gulf of Mexico Sea Grant Oil Spill Science Outreach Program, Alaska Sea Grant College Program, University of Southern California (USC) Sea Grant Program, and Virginia Sea Grant College Program coordinated the effort, which resulted in five regional events (Hale, Covi, Holen, Partyka, Schulhof, Sempier, & Skelton, 2019).

Restoration efforts have been implemented recently that may improve water quality and alter the relative abundance of different phytoplankton taxa in the river. To determine the effects that environmental shifts may have on diatom abundance and phytoplankton community composition in the Anacostia River, a mesocosm experiment and laboratory studies were conducted. The results of the mesocosm study revealed that diatoms were consistently outcompeted by cyanobacteria. Additionally, phosphorus enrichment led to a 50% increase in cyanobacterial abundance and decreased the abundance of diatoms. In the culture study, shifts in water temperature and nutrient availability altered diatom growth rates, photosynthesis, silica deposition, and NO3-reduction. Together, these studies highlight the interactive effects that nutrient availability and temperature may have on the physiology and subsequent growth of diatoms in the Anacostia River.","Gleich, Samantha J.",MDU-Y-19-002,UM-​SG-​RO-​2019-​02,R/EH-17;R/E-1,theses/disserta​tions,2019,NA,Maryland Sea Grant,Nutrient Effects on Phytoplankton Community Composition in the Eutrophic Anacostia River and a Focus on Diatom Physiology,NA,NA,NA,A thesis for the degree of Master of Science in Environmental Science,NA,NA05OAR4171042;NA10OAR4170072;NA14OAR4170090

Second, an integrated nowcast forecast operational system, a high performance and distributed computing infrastructure, digitally detects and assesses flash rip hazards in high, moderate or low risks. Third, an automated kiosk dynamically issues real-time warnings on site by a three-color dynamic lights and a digital display monitor. Results of flash rip detection show that the combined length threshold and HSV-based segmentation method can be used in both sunny and cloudy days with an overall accuracy of 83%. Nonstationary locations and intermittent occurrences of flash rips are observed and characterized. The length of the flash rip ranges between 10 and 50 m. The duration of flash rips varies from 1 to 5 min with 65% of flash rips less than 2 min. A flash rip occurrence checklist by adding two new (storm and visual observation) factors is constructed to reliably assesses the likelihood of hazardous flash rips. Public communication through media mentions, news releases, and website usages show the strong interest and support of the LOCKS as a new approach to issue timely and dynamic flash rip warnings to beach users.

We observed a significant negative linear relationship between concentrations of Cu and dissolved oxygen at Rock Creek (p < 0.05). Sometimes, turbidity had significant positive linear relationships with Pb and Hg concentrations. There were negative or positive linear relationships between Pb, Cd, Zn, and Hg and specific conductance. There also appeared to be relationships between watershed areal fluxes of Pb, Cu, Zn, and Cd in streams with turbidity.

Recognizing gaps in existing sea level rise (SLR) information for Washington state, in 2018 a team of scientists developed updated projections for Washington’s coast under the auspices of the Washington Coastal Resilience Project (WCRP). These projections show a range of SLR magnitudes that Washington state could experience, associated with different potential climate change futures driven by society’s choices about greenhouse gas emissions. The 2018 SLR projections provide more insight into the potential range of SLR that Washington state could experience than has been available before, bringing new information to potential users. However, using these projections requires careful consideration of certain choices described in this primer when selecting values to use in planning and design. The next step after selecting values from the 2018 SLR projections for use in planning, policy, or project design, is to determine how to adapt those plans, policies, or projects to reduce the potential impacts of SLR. There are multiple options for adapting to higher water levels, including moving projects, modifying project designs, refining building codes, or requiring existing building codes in new at-​risk locations. Selecting adaptation options will depend on how sensitive the area or project is to flooding and other impacts of SLR.;This publication was prepared for the Washington Coastal Resilience Project.

To test the hypothesis that physiological status is altered by stress conditioning, we subjected juvenile Pacific geoduck, Panopea generosa, to repeated exposures of elevated pCO2 in a commercial hatchery setting followed by a period in ambient common garden. Respiration rate and shell length were measured for juvenile geoduck periodically throughout short-term repeated reciprocal exposure periods in ambient (~550 μatm) or elevated (~2400 μatm) pCO2 treatments and in common, ambient conditions, 5 months after exposure. Short-term exposure periods comprised an initial 10-day exposure followed by 14 days in ambient before a secondary 6-day reciprocal exposure. The initial exposure to elevated pCO2 significantly reduced respiration rate by 25% relative to ambient conditions, but no effect on shell growth was detected. Following 14 days in common garden, ambient conditions, reciprocal exposure to elevated or ambient pCO2 did not alter juvenile respiration rates, indicating ability for metabolic recovery under subsequent conditions. Shell growth was negatively affected during the reciprocal treatment in both exposure histories; however, clams exposed to the initial elevated pCO2 showed compensatory growth with 5.8% greater shell length (on average between the two secondary exposures) after 5 months in ambient conditions. Additionally, clams exposed to the secondary elevated pCO2 showed 52.4% increase in respiration rate after 5 months in ambient conditions. Early exposure to low pH appears to trigger carryover effects suggesting bioenergetic re-allocation facilitates growth compensation.

Induction of immune response pathways may occur as part of the natural progression of larval development, but an up-regulation of pathways can also occur in response to a pathogen. Here, we took advantage of a protozoan ciliate infestation of a larval geoduck clam culture in a commercial hatchery to investigate the molecular underpinnings of the innate immune response of the larvae to the pathogen. Larval proteomes were analyzed on days 4–10 post-​fertilization; ciliates were present on days 8 and 10 post-​fertilization. Through comparisons with larval cultures that did not encounter ciliates, proteins implicated in the response to ciliate presence were identified using mass spectrometry-​based proteomics.

There was also an increased abundance of proteins typically associated with the stress and immune responses during ciliate exposure, such as heat shock proteins, glutathione metabolism, and the reactive oxygen species response.

We used a ‘magnetic displacement’ experiment to demonstrate that juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) use magnetic cues to orient. The experiment was designed to simultaneously explore whether their magnetic map is used to direct fish (i) homeward, (ii) toward the center of their broad oceanic range or (iii) along their oceanic migratory route. The headings adopted by these navigationally naive fish coincided remarkably well with the direction of the juveniles’ migration inferred from historical tagging and catch data. This suggests that the large- scale movements of pink salmon across the North Pacific may be driven largely by their innate use of geomagnetic map cues. Key aspects of the oceanic ecology of pink salmon and other marine migrants might therefore be predicted from magnetic displacement experiments.","Putnam, Nathan F.;Williams, Chase R.;Gallagher, Evan P.;Dittman, Andrew H.",WASHU-R-20-007,WSG-TA 20-05,R/HCE-16,reprints (peer-reviewed),2020,The Company of Biologists Ltd.,Washington Sea Grant,A sense of place: pink salmon use a magnetic map for orientation,"Journal of Experimental Biology, 223(4): Article jeb218735, February 2020",10.1242/jeb.218​735,NA,Open article (NOAA),NA,NA

This evaluation was supplemented with an online survey of 27 hazard planning professionals in these counties, exploring their perceptions of collaboration in the respective planning processes, as well as implementation of the plans. Overall, the plans excel in some components of plan quality (e.g., vision statement) but suggest room for improvement in other components (e.g., policies and actions). Survey results do not provide evidence that more collaborative planning processes yield higher-quality plans in the context of these counties.

We used contemporary data (1990-2017) from a standardized annual bottom trawl survey with historical logbook information (1948-1977) from a research vessel. We standardized data to account for spatial and temporal effects on catch rate by first fitting a Bayesian model to the contemporary data, and then using the posterior distributions of the covariates as prior distributions when fitting models to the historical data. We found that most of the 15 species chosen for analysis had highly variable population dynamics within both time periods, and that patterns of variability were similar in the contemporary and historical time period. Surprisingly, there was little evidence of community-wide recovery following regulations that first limited and then banned commercial bottom trawling in the late 1980s to mid-1990s. Spotted ratfish and English sole dominated catches in both time periods, and species that were common in the historical time period were also common in the contemporary time period. The absence of coherent community changes in response to fisheries regulations and other major social and ecological changes may signal the complex dynamics of an urban estuary that is subject to multiple external drivers, and speaks to the need to consider long-term dynamic behavior of populations and communities when establishing ecological indicators.","Essington, Timothy;Ward, Eric J.;Francis, Tessa B.;Greene, Correigh;Kuehne, Lauren;Lowry, Dayv",WASHU-R-21-001,WSG-TA 20-08,E/I-24,reprints (peer-reviewed),2020,Inter-Research,Washington Sea Grant,Historical reconstruction of the Puget Sound (USA) groundfish community,"Marine Ecology Progress Series, 657:173–189, January 7, 2021",10.3354/meps135​47,NA,NA,NA,NA14OAR4170078

The addition of MP or silt may change the functional response of mussels. We measured clearance rate (CR) of Mytilus trossulus in three particle treatments (algae, MP + algae, and silt + algae) across four concentrations to (1) determine if the effects of MP and silt are similar and (2) disentangle the effects of particle type, particle concentration, and proportion of abiotic particles. CR decreased by 62% at high MP concentrations (> 1250 particles mL−1 ) but was not affected at equivalent silt concentrations. These findings suggest high MP concentrations inhibit mussel CR, more than expected by changes in particle concentration or the proportion of abiotic particles. As plastic production increases, mussel exposure to MP will increase, potentially reducing energy transfer, benthic-pelagic coupling, and water clarity.;Scientific Significance Statement: Microplastic is a rising form of marine pollution and interacts with numerous organisms, such as suspension-​feeding mussels. Mussels can filter microalgae, natural sediment like silt, and now, microplastic. Microplastic is known to have some negative effects on mussels at high concentrations but it remains unclear if microplastic inhibits feeding processes. We found evidence that mussel clearance rate (CR) is inhibited under high concentrations of microplastic and not by similar concentrations of other abiotic particle or current levels of microplastics in nature. Decreased mussel CRs could have important consequences at the ecosystem level, such as reducing water clarity and benthic-pelagic coupling.","Harris, Lyda S.

Mixed-effects regression modeling indicates that views on climate and the balance between environment and economy were consistent predictors of support across most energy types, while political ideology was less consistent. Perceived local importance of both extractive and renewable energy industries were significant predictors of support for some, but not all, energy sources, as were education and gender.

The objectives of the workshop were: 1. Establish a common understanding of the options to grant property rights for aquaculture in federal waters. 2. Identify the needs of government and industry relative to the mechanisms to grant property rights. 3. Evaluate the options to grant property rights. 4. Draft recommendations for criteria to be included in legislation. These plans were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than cancel or indefinitely postpone the workshop, the NSGLC decided to host portions of the workshop virtually. The original 1.5-day workshop agenda was broken into three separate engagements: (1) a virtual pre-workshop briefing held on May 5, 2020 (Objective 1); (2) a virtual workshop held on May 12-13, 2020 (Objectives 2 and 3); and (3) an in-person follow-up meeting tentatively planned for February 2021 (Objective 4).

WSG will use this toolkit as a guideline for doing equitable engagement and community development. The purpose is to support the UMP to equitably engage, empower, uplift knowledge systems, increase accessibility, and to listen, learn, support, and collaborate. To develop the toolkit we conducted literature reviews and key informant interviews to obtain information of people’s connection to water and what they hope to see emerge from the UMP. We also facilitated workshops to start a dialogue on the intersectionali​ty of water and its application to our everyday lives. The goal of the UMP is to advance collaboration amongst stakeholders and to hear community needs and concerns. This will be done effectively through DEI evaluators who will monitor engagement and community liaisons who will act as advocates for their community. We have integrated the UN Sustainable Development Goals to provide an intersectional ​ framework to the UMP. We can create target indicators for each goal that align with the work we seek to achieve. The Community Engagement for the Urban Marine Program Toolkit is a comprehensive guide capable of advancing the culture of WSG programs to be equitable and sustainable within BIPOC communities. The purpose of this toolkit is to engage and empower community members of Western Washington in marine conservation, programming, and engagement with WSG. To do conservation work equitably, requires engaging with communities in decision-​making processes. This looks like reaching outward and looking inward to build resilience and relationships from the lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Recognizing traditional and local knowledge is also key to equitable community engagement because the communities served by WSG have a plethora of cultural and generational knowledge that transcends Western science and understanding. By recognizing TLK, knowledge holders may gain power and agency, while having their diverse identities be welcomed and appreciated. Furthermore, to achieve WSG’s mission and vision, it is integral to increase accessibility to WA’s shorelines and marine ecosystems for those who may not be, or haven’t historically been, able to experience it. To do this, we must cultivate community partnerships with BIPOC communities, including but not limited to, schools, community leaders and community centers to hear their needs and concerns, and how they want to be a part of WSG. This may require meeting people where they are physically located. Emails and calls are not always substantial enough, nor are they accessible to everyone. Meeting communities where they are looks like meeting with community leaders in an accessible location and learning from and with them how we can provide appropriate programming.","Walker VI, William;Watkinson, Melissa;Hampton, Adrienne",WASHU-H-20-002,WSG-PM 20-04,A/ACE-1,"handbooks, manuals, guides",2020,Washington Sea Grant,Washington Sea Grant,Amplifying Community Engagement for the Urban Marine Program at Washington Sea Grant (ToolKit),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Corrosive conditions associated with acidification are already impacting some calcifiers such as pteropods, crab, and foraminifera1, and laboratory studies further suggest that oysters, crabs, krill, and salmon are also sensitive to the effects of acidification. These species are not only important to the health of the marine ecosystem, but some are highly valued culturally and economically as well. According to the Governor’s Office, in the coming decades, as seawater absorbs increasing amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide, conditions in Washington waters are expected to worsen, with changes occurring “more rapidly in Puget Sound waters than along our coast.” In the face of these deteriorating conditions, we are confronted with many questions, one of which is: what can we do locally - in the water - to ameliorate the effects of acidification? The investigation described in this report sought an answer to that question. Thus began an investigation into whether seaweed cultivation could draw down CO2 within the kelp farm and improve conditions for calcifying species. The field study was conducted at a five-acre seaweed and shellfish farm operated by HCM, located off Hood Head, just north of the Hood Canal Bridge in Jefferson County, Washington. After acquiring the necessary permits, propagating kelp seed, and outplanting sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima), the team measured the effect of kelp on several metrics of seawater chemistry and on a small suite of calcifying organisms within the kelp farm. Additionally, the team developed a computer model that simulates environmental variables and kelp growth, and then integrates the sampling data into an interface that graphically depicts the effect of kelp cultivation on seawater chemistry. Comb​ined funding from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation and the U.S. Navy enabled two years of field investigation at the Hood Head demonstration site.

The Rebuilding Plan is being developed by the Herring Technical Working Group. The Technical Working Group is made up of staff of the Council of the Haida Nation (CHN), Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and Parks Canada. Our use of the term “traditional knowledge” is intended to capture the elements of Berkes’ definition, while also capturing a cultural distinction between the Indigenous and settler populations of Haida Gwaii. It focuses on marine and maritime species, and the marine environment. We have not limited the knowledge to “ecological” because we are also documenting cultural, historical, economic, political and societal information as it pertains to the marine environment.

This mixing results in constituents like temperature and salinity being evenly distributed within this layer. The factors that contribute to the characteristics of that mixed layer (e.g. wind and solar irradiance) vary in location and time, especially over seasons, leading to variations in space and time in the depth of that well mixed layer. This data lab will allow students to examine real data from two locations in the ocean to study these interacting processes, and how they influence the depth and characteristics of the mixed layer. This exercise is designed to facilitate learning about surface mixing in the ocean. Pieces of the exercise can be used as appropriate for the instructor goals. The collection consists of 3 sets of activities. Part One is focused on data exploration activities, to be used during the Exploration phase of the Learning Cycle. Part Two is focused on the Concept Invention phase of the Learning Cycle. Part Three is focused on the Application phase of the Learning Cycle. These activities were developed to assist with students' understanding of mixed layer dynamics, in part because surface ocean dynamics are foundational in Oceanography and cut across numerous Ocean Literacy principles, and also because wind-driven surface mixing in particular is widespread, easily observed in a variety of systems and with tractable dynamics that make it suitable for introductory oceanography instruction.

The original report to NOAA by Walter H. Adey was not published after the sanctuary concept for Maine was abandoned. Because significant human-related climatic and ecosystem changes are underway in the Gulf of Maine, that report provides valuable baseline data and is included as the Appendix to this volume. After qualitatively describing the geological, physical, chemical, and biogeographical features of Gouldsboro Bay and adjacent Dyer Bay, we quantitatively describe the principal bay ecological communities with data collected during the 1981–1983 ecosystem assessment as well as additional measurements taken within the past decade. We then undertake a comparison of the primary productivity of these bays with the Google Earth Pro polygon tool to determine component areas. Benthic taxa are the dominant primary producers in both bays: rockweeds (primarily Ascophyllum nodosum, with Fucus vesiculosus secondary) in the intertidal; Irish moss (Chondrus crispus, with Fucus distichus secondary) as a near monoculture in the lowest intertidal (infralittoral)​; kelps (primarily Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata, and Agarum clathratum) in the rocky subtidal; and the angiosperm Zostera marina (seagrass) in soft bottom substrate. The rocky intertidal, dominated by Ascophyllum with a specific productivity of 10.6 kg/m2/year, provides nearly one-third of all bay productivity. Because of the proportionally greater shore length relative to area of Dyer Bay, it has 45% greater productivity for its surface area than Gouldsboro Bay. Kelp has a specific productivity value of 7.2 kg/m2/year, and Zostera of 1.2 kg/m2/year. The kelps provide approximately 20% of Gouldsboro Bay’s primary productivity and 35% of that of Dyer Bay. Zostera provides roughly 20% of total primary productivity in Gouldsboro Bay and 12%in Dyer Bay. With a primary productivity of 1.73 kg/m2/year, salt marshes provide only 3.7% (Gouldsboro) and 2.6% (Dyer) of total primary productivity. With a primary productivity of 0.06 kg/m2/year, plankton account for 23.8% of Gouldsboro Bay and 16% of Dyer Bay primary productivity.","Adey, Walter H.;Suskiewicz, Thew S.;Rasher, Douglas B.",MEU-B-20-001,NA,R/18-03,books,2020,Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press,Maine Sea Grant,"Marine Ecosystem Analysis of Gouldsboro and Dyer Bays, Maine","H.

The United States (U.S.) has implemented Vibrio Control Plans to mitigate risks associated with these bacteria, which include time and temperature requirements for post-harvest processing and maintaining an unbroken cold chain. In this study, we tracked the performance of cold chains for U.S. farmed oysters distributed nationally and internationally using temperature sensors. Boxes and bags of oysters (n = 125) were shipped from farms in Washington State and the Chesapeake Bay to 143 unique businesses in 20 U.S. states, Washington D.C., and Hong Kong, China. Eighty-​one percent of the temperature sensors were returned with usable data. The average product temperature among all participants was 4.4 ± 2.7 °C (40 ± 5 °F), which is 5.6 °C (10 °F) cooler than the 10 °C (50 °F) guidance cri- terium established by the U.S. government. There were spikes in temperature in some shipments: 18% of shipments (16/91) experienced oyster temperatures above 10 °C for one hour or more, and the median time spent out of temperature control was 2.5 h. We modeled V. parahaemolyticu​s abundance using temperature sensor data and 75% (68/91) of shipments had a net decrease in V. parahaemolyticu​s abundance in the cold chain. There are opportunities for improvements in cold chain performance in the shellfish industry and related businesses.

However, whether or not game behavior parallels real-​world behavior within the same participants or contexts remains an open question. Methodological diversity is a strength of anthropology as a discipline, and therefore anthropologists are well poised to design more effective tests of parallelism in the future.

Supply chain actors must work together to bring refrigerated oysters to market quickly, while maintaining product value,  safety and traceability information. In light of these demands, this study assesses the performance and conduct of supply chains for U.S. farmed oysters (Crassostrea virginica, C. gigas). Over the two-year study period, we conducted interviews with 56 businesses and tracked 125 oyster shipments from two major growing regions in the U.S. through six different types of supply chains. We hypothesized that direct and intermediated supply chains would perform differently in terms of time-to-market, product temperature in cold chains, compliance with temperature regulations, and modeled risks from Vibrio parahaemolyticu​s.  Intermediated supply chains, by their definition have more connections than direct supply chains, and we found this introduces a longer time-​to-​market and a higher incidence of time and temperature abuse. However, these factors did not lead to greater modeled V. parahaemolyticu​s  risks. Participants in both direct and intermediated supply chains were  aware of the importance of traceability and felt uniformly positive about their ability to perform recalls. A common concern was the speed of government-​imposed recalls, which can be declared by regulators after  the affected live oysters are consumed. Members of these supply chains play different roles in maintaining the cold chain, possess different levels of information related to traceability, and describe different levels of trust with other supply chain actors. This paper contributes to a growing body of knowledge on supply chains for seafood and their critical, and sometimes overlooked, role in larger food systems.","Love, David C.;Lane, Robert M.;Kuehl, Lillian M.;Hudson, Bobbi;Harding, Jamie;Clancy, Kate;Fry, Jillian P.",VSGCP-R-20-018,VSG-20-9,A/721541,reprints (peer-reviewed),2020,Elsevier,Virginia Sea Grant,Performance and conduct of supply chains for United States farmed oysters,"Aquaculture, 515: Article 734569, January 15, 2020. https://doi.or​g/10.1016/j.aqu​aculture.2019.7​34569",10.1016/j.aquac​ulture.2019.734​569,NA,Open access article,NA,NA

These laws serve to protect farmers and other agricultural producers by shielding their operations from nuisance suits. Virginia’s RTF law has helped to resolve land use conflicts and has helped to protect an agricultural industry that is both culturally and economically vital to the state. Commercial shellfish activity has also historically proven vital to Virginia’s unique coastal identity and economy. Further, over the last several decades, Virginia’s diverse aquaculture industry has grown, making Virginia one of the leading producers of aquacultural products in the United States. Despite its mighty contributions, aquaculture has yet to be included under Virginia’s RTF law and producers have not enjoyed its protections while facing scrutiny from private landowners and local authorities. As Virginia's coastal regions continue to experience a population increase and waves of development, the likelihood of land use conflicts related to aquaculture activities is only increasing. Other states -- such as neighboring Maryland and fellow aquaculture leader Washington State -- have moved to either include aquaculture under their RTF law or offer the industry similar levels of statutory protection via other provisions. These approaches suggest that extending RTFtype protections to the aquaculture industry in Virginia would not only benefit the industry - it is also possible.","Woodward, Matt;Corso, Andrew",VSGCP-T-20-006,VSG-20-43,A/721543,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2020,Virginia Coastal Policy Center/VA Sea Grant,Virginia Sea Grant,Law on the Half Shell: Applying a Right-to-Farm Framework to Virginia’s Aquaculture Industry,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hundreds of fatalities and incidents reported on the Great Lakes coasts are caused by rip currents, which impose severe hazards to the Great Lakes beach users. The objective of this dissertation is to characterize rip currents in Lake Michigan and in Lake Superior, and to develop assessment tools for effective warning of the rip current hazards to coastal communities. Flash rips are transient and intermittent rip currents. To provide real-time flash rip warnings to beach users, a Lifeguarding Operational Camera Kiosk System (LOCKS) is developed and implemented at the North Beach of Port Washington, WI. LOCKS has three components. First, a real-time environmental observation system acquires timely beach view images and local environmental condition data. Second, an integrated nowcast forecast operational system, high performance and distributed computing infrastructure,​ digitally detects and assesses flash rip hazards in high, moderate, or low risks. Third, an automated kiosk dynamically issues real-​time on-​site warnings by a three-color dynamic light and a digital display monitor. Results show that LOCKS can detect flash rips in both sunny and cloudy days with an overall accuracy of 83%. Characteristics of flash rips are observed to have nonstationary locations and intermittent occurrences. The developed flash rip occurrence checklist is demonstrated to reliably assess the likelihood of hazardous flash rips by using two new proxies of visual images and convective storms. The observed co-occurrence of convective storms and flash rips suggests future studies on investigating the meteorologicall​y induced water level oscillations in generating flash rips. Flash rips generated by meteorologicall​y induced water level oscillations (MIWLOs) are revealed to pose unrecognized hazards to the unawareness of beach users. Occurrences and causative processes of generating flash rips are investigated in Lake Michigan at the North Beach of Port Washington, by compiling images, hydrodynamic and atmospheric observations with reconstructed velocity fields from integrated atmospheric-​hydrodynamic modeling. Results show that meteotsunamis, seiches, wind waves, and combined effects are all pathways to generate flash rips. Temporal transiency, intermittency, and spatial ubiquity and unpredictabilit​y are characteristics of flash rips induced by MIWLOs and elevated the hidden danger to beach swimmers. Rip currents generated by MIWLOs are found to be associated with 70% of current related incidents on the Great Lakes coasts. Statistics evidence also suggests that causes of many incidents on United States ocean coasts can be related to the unrecognized flash rip hazards. Hidden flash rips can be wide-spread hazards, as several drowning incidents occurred across Lake Michigan during a series of convective storms. Features of storm disturbances and hydrodynamic forcing are characterized to depict possible causes of the drowning incidents. Nearshore processes generating unexpected flash rips through storm-induced energetic wind waves, meteotsunami-​induced longshore currents, water level drawdowns, and seiches are revealed. Hidden flash rip hazards are frequent under both low meteorologicall​y induced water level oscillations and low wind waves, a condition has not been recognized before. The time delay in flash rip occurrences relative to convective storms further elevates the risk of the hidden danger to the unaware beach swimmers. Rip currents near coastal structures are one cause for drownings in the Great Lakes. A Structure Rip Checklist and Assessment Matrix (SRiCAM) is developed by characterizing rip currents near breakwaters and aims to provide timely warnings to beach users. Rip currents occurrences near the north breakwater of Port Washington, are associated with environmental proxies. Results show that rip currents can occur when the water appears seemingly calm near the structure, thus imposing hidden dangers to unalerted beach users. The performance of the SRiCAM shows consistency and inclusiveness by using the four-level tier assessment. Furthermore, the SRiCAM is integrated into a cyberinfrastruc​ture with a data contingency plan to provide real-time warnings to the public. The applicability of the SRiCAM is also demonstrated by applying to thirty-eight other locations and shows great potential to be widely extended to wider regions of the Great Lakes to foster the resilience of recreational water users to the rip current hazards. Lastly, rip currents are characterized on the western shore of Lake Superior. Remote-​sensing data including aerial imagery, coastal LiDAR elevations, and nearshore webcam images are analyzed to detect bathymetry features like nearshore bars where rip currents are prone to occur at two beaches, the 12th St Beach and the 22nd St Beach in Duluth, MN. Results show that double crescent bar systems, experiencing dynamic evolution on the time scale from years to hours, are dominant along the western shore of Lake Superior. The documented bathymetric characteristics​ provide information about hotspots and can be used to facilitate the future studies of rip currents on the western shore of Lake Superior for the resilience to rip current hazards for the Great Lakes coastal communities.","Liu, Yuli",WISCU-Y-20-001,WISCU-Y-20-001,R/RCE-11,theses/disserta​tions,2020,Wisconsin Sea Grant;University of Wisconsin-​Madison,Wisconsin Sea Grant,Rip Currents in Lake Michigan and in Lake Superior,NA,NA,NA,For the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Civil and Environmental Engineering) at the University of Wisconsin-​Madison,NA,NA18OAR4170097

We hope this collection will arouse the reader's interest in the ocean and its mysteries. This collection is the result of months of searches through hundreds of volumes. We have included tales from every inhabited continent so that American students can enjoy their varied heritage. Our search led us to Houston, Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. As far as we can determine, this collection represents the only volume of international fairy and folk tales exclusively about the earth's seas. The following stories are in this book: American: The Girl Fish; The Serpents. Eskimo: A Nenets Tale; The Story of Nuliajuk, Mother of the Sea, Ruler of all Beasts, the Most Dangerous and Terrible of all Spirits, to whom Nothing is Impossible; The Sea Lion Hunt; The House of the Sea Lions; The Polar Bear; The Lake Monster; The Young Man Helps. North American Indian: The Woman Stolen by Killer-Whales; the Empounded Water. Australian: A Fish Story. African: The Serpent's Bride; The Marriage of the Rain; The Golden-Headed Fish. Asian: The Flying Ship; Why the Ocean is Salty; The Sea of Gold. European: Cossack-The Story of Tremsin, the Bird Zhar, and Nastasia, the Lovely Maid of the Sea; Russian- The Raven and the Lobster; Salt; German-The Fisherman and His Wife; Scandinavian- The Little Mermaid; The Troll's Daughter; and Why the Sea is Salt.","Cowan, Elizabeth;Davis, Karen;Hubbard, Fain",TAMU-E-81-002,TAMU-SG-81-402,NA,educational materials,1981,NA,Texas Sea Grant,Fairy Tales of the Sea,NA,NA,NA,Marine literature;Several blank pages are inside this booklet and do not appear on the digital PDF.

In 1969 the Sea Grant Program was established at the University of Miami. The outstanding success of the Land Grant Colleges Program, which in 100 years has brought the United States to its current superior position in agriculture production, helped initiate the Sea Grant concept. This concept has three primary objectives: to promote excellence in education and training, research and information services in the University's disciplines that relate to the sea. The successful accomplishment of these objectives, it is believed, will result in practical contributions to marine oriented industries and government and will, in addition, protect and preserve the environment for the benefit of all. With these objectives, this series of Sea Grant Special Bulletins is intended to convey useful information to the marine communities interested in resource development. While the responsibility for administration of the Sea Grant Program rests with the Department of Commerce, the responsibility for financing the program is shared by federal, industrial and University of Miami contributions. This paper, The Marine Technician—Past​, Present and Future, was presented at the Marine Technology Society meeting in Washington, D.C., 1971. Because of continued interest shown through the number of requests for copies of this paper, it is published as a part of the Sea Grant Program. ABSTRA​CT - The general origin and role of the technician is discussed. The concept of the Marine Technician evolves from considerations of past practices, community needs, and actions taken to meet these needs. The role of the supporting community is discussed and significant factors for a successful program outlined.

The Pacific albacore fishery is one of the mos valuable of the west coast of North America, yielding an average annual harvest of 22,800 tons of premium quality tuna to California, Oregon, and Washington fishermen. Because of the high value of the albacore harvest, and also because of significant scientific interest in these trans-Pacific migrants, extensive researches have been conducted on albacore over the past several decades by scientists of State and Federal agencies and a number of Pacific Coast universities.

We may argue with the scope, design, and/or findings from these studies, nevertheless we are developing some rudimentary information to present in behalf of fishing, anglers, and fisheries and their management. These data, when expressed in economic terms to establish primary and secondary benefits, are essential to decision making and allocation decisions. In this regard, resource economics, like the law, is becoming increasingly important to the fishery manager. The economic aspects of optimum sustainable yield (OSY) management have been previously dealt with by many more competent than I. Therefore, while this paper will not ignore the economic aspects of fisheries management, it will focus on the human and social aspects of fishing benefits: their definition, identification, measurement, and consideration in managerial policy and decision making.","Ditton, Robert B.",TAMU-R-77-010,NA,NA,reprints (not peer-reviewed),1977,NA,Texas Sea Grant,Human Perspectives in Optimum Sustainable Yield Fisheries Management,"Marine Recreational Fisheries 2: Proceedings of the Second Annual Marine Recreational Fisheries Symposium, San Francisco, California, April 6-7, 1977, Richard H.

The model's primary function was to provide a bird's eye view of circulation that could not be obtained readily from field observations a one. Beyond its role in basic research, the model has served as a teaching aid and in studies of tides and tidal currents, and in applied research relevant to pollution at various locations. The model has also been a prime attraction at departmental open houses where frequent winners of boat races in the Sound are numbered among its keenest observers. John Lincoln, who took the original photographs as a part of a recent research project, and Noel McGary, who prepared the charts from these photographs, collaborated in the preparation of this atlas. John was involved in the design, construction, and instrumentation​ of the model and has operated it over many years for a wide variety of studies. Noel, a longtime cartographer for the Department of Oceanography, has made notable contributions to portrayal of bathymetry and water properties of Puget Sound and the North Pacific. In preparing the various charts, the authors have keyed them to a single reference, the tide stage at Seattle, rather than the tidal currents, as is the case of the conventional current charts, which in the Sound are referenced to two locations of differing flow characteristics​. This enables the user to relate the charts to changes in water level easily observable along shore, or to the widely distributed tide tables or tide calendars. It also provides a more comprehensive picture of the system as a whole. This atlas should be of interest and value to boaters, fishermen, and recreationists, as well as to engineers and scientists concerned with surface currents in Puget Sound.

Competition among and within the many federal agencies for appropriations from a finite federal budget clearly places upon each entity the responsibility of reviewing past performance, scrutinizing current projects, and assessing probable consequences. The following study will examine the mechanisms by which Sea Grant identifies awareness of regional needs in marine resource areas, coordinates the development of educational objectives, selects courses and programs which satisfy them and, finally, commits funds for their operation. The report will similarly examine the mechanisms used to, first, identify existing research activities relevant to regional marine resource needs; second, to define new research programs in hitherto neglected, but important aeas; and finally, to integrate often fragmented research efforts into need-oriented, cohesive programs. The role of advisory services throughout theses processes will be described and documented. While Sea Grant's activities might be characterized by their diversity, one issue is pervasive: Sea Grant's primary role of promoting and maintaining relationships among all the participants in the use and management of marine resources. Four broad categories of participation can be defined: 1. Institutions of higher education. 2. Regional marine resource-​oriented industries. 3. Public agencies. 4.

This sensitivity arises from the fact that the instantaneous tidal height is affected by tidal wave reflection from the local shoreline configuration, so that from the mathematical point of view the boundary condition includes part of the problem solution. In principle, the difficulty can be resolved by replacing the boundary condition at the mouth of the bay by a matching requirement between far-field and nearshore solutions; for tidal problems, such a procedure is complicated by the importance of the Coriolis term as well as by bathymetric and topographic complexities. In this report, we describe a number of matching methods which can be used. These methods are based on integral equations, finite elements, variational methods, transform methods, series solutions, or on a combination of such methods.","Pearson, Carl",WASHU-T-79-001,WSG 79-1,NA,technical reports/surveys​/patents,1979,University of Washington Sea Grant Program,Washington Sea Grant,FAR-FIELD MATCHING FOR TIDAL CALCULATIONS IN NEARSHORE REGIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOAA Sea Grant No. 04-7-158-44021;Natl.

The first GUTSHOP in 1976 and the second GUTSHOP in 1978 were initiated to bring together a diverse group of scientists actively involved in studies of food habits, predation, feeding behavior, competition, and food web structure in fishes, The general purpose of these workshops was to achieve some consensus on sampling design and techniques, analysis and statistical procedures, and interpretive tools available for fish food habits studi es. The proceedings of GUTSHOP ' 76 and GUTSHOP '78 were published in Simenstad and Lipavsky 977! and Lipovsky and Simenstad 978!, respectively. While the accomplishments of the fi rst twa workshops obviously resolved many of the questions plaguing our studies, the general opinion of the GUTSHOP '78 participants was that a third workshop would be beneficial and should consider both continued discussion of never-​ending problems, such as statistical analyses, as well as topics that we had not yet covered, such as the bioenergetics of feeding. Although it took three years for us to assemble again, the wait was rewarded by a highly evolved meeting in which all had something new to discuss and the infusion of new scientists broadened our perspectives. The decision to hold GUTSHOP '81 in California resulted from a survey of the participants at the end of GUTSHOP '78, which suggested that many California scientists who were involved in fish food habits studies were not able ta contribute ta the workshops held in the Pacific Northwest. Greg Cailliet was asked to act as co-chair.man to accomplish efficient workshop arrangements and to ensure contact with California scientists who were not yet familiar with the workshop,. The Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove was chosen because it was close to the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, Greg's institution, and because of its superb location, accommodations,​ and facilities. The only disadvantage was that we all spent too much time sequestered in darkened rooms attending to the science of fish guts and did not have enough opportunities to spend some time outside enjoying the balmy weather by the beautiful seashore. We arranged GUTSHOP '81 around five topics: I. Methodology and Statistical Analysis II, Bioenergetics af Fish Feeding III. Competition and Resource Partitioning IV. Feeding Behavior of Fishes and Prey Y. Fish Feeding as Structuring Force on Prey Communities. Th​e Summary and Reconmendations provides our synopsis of GUTSHOP 81's accomplishments​, the riddles we left unaddressed, and when, where, and in what form the benevolent GUTSHOP sphinx may rise again.",NA,WASHU-W-81-003,WSG-WO 82-2,A/PC-5,conference/work​shop proceedings,1982,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"GUTSHOP '81: Fish Food Habits Studies, Proceedings of the Third Pacific Workshop","GUTSHOP '81, Fish Food Habits Studies, Proceedings of the Third Pacific Workshop, December 6-9, 1981, Pacific Grove, California",NA,NA,NA,"Cailliet, Gregor M.;Simenstad, Charles A.",NA81AA-D-00030
/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-wa-csv/5245961_2823_2819860.csv,242,"Before stating the broad purpose of this workshop on ocean resources economics, I would like to provide a context by describing the mission of its sponsor, the Office of Ocean Resources Coordination and Assessment (ORCA) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Within NOAA we are responsible for identifying and evaluating the impacts of alternative resource uses in intensely used coastal and ocean regions. We develop and recommend management strategies or policies for the use of resources of these regions which will result in maximum benefit to the Nation. We have the responsibility for development of NOAA-wide policy positions in two important areas: (1) outer continental shelf oil and gas exploration and development; and (2) marine transportation. To improve our ability to carry out this mission, ORCA sponsors projects to develop and apply new methods for projecting and evaluating both the short-term and long-term environmental and economic impacts of coastal and ocean resource use decisions. We have initiated a series of five regional strategic assessments of the entire U.S. coastal and 200-mile fishery conservation zone to identify significant resource use conflicts before they occur. We also give technical assistance to states and other federal agencies on a wide variety of coastal and ocean resource issues, ranging from special area management to evaluating the onshore impacts of marine mineral mining. We administer the Office of Coastal Zone Management's responsibilitie​s for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act with respect to both state coastal zone management programs and proposed marine and estuarine sanctuaries. We are one of the few--perhaps the only--federal offices attempting to develop in a strategic manner the necessary data base and methods for analyzing national policy on programs for coastal and ocean resource use on a comprehensive scale and within an explicit analytical framework. The purpose of this workshop is to serve as one departure point for a modest program of economic and institutional research related to the management of ocean resources that will be undertaken by ORCA later this year. The oceans represent a set of resources for which, in fact, very little management currently exists. An important objective of this program will be the development and use of data with which to consider explicitly the benefits and costs to the nation and its coastal regions of alternative ocean resource uses.

Or Puget Sound? The need behind that question usually relates to moorage. Typically, a marina consultant under contract to a public port authority or a private marina developer is attempting to estimate demand for a proposed marina somewhere in coastal Washington. Investors, developers, and port officials need to know the state of the market in their service area, how many s'lips are likely to fill over what period of time, and at what rental rate. Municipal and county planning staff and their elected officials are similarly concerned about demand for moorage. These local government planning agencies must allocate scarce shoreline space among a number of competing land and water uses. State and federal resource management agencies, especially those with mandates to conserve fish and wildlife habitat and maintain or improve water quality, are understandably reluctant to permit displacement or deterioration of those resources where significant need for moorage facilities cannot be demonstrated. Other state and federal agencies administer 1 and acquisition and development grant s for pub 1 i c outdoor recreation facilities. The Interagency Committee for Outdoor Recreation (IAC) prepares the State-wide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP), a document which is used to guide disbursements of federal and state outdoor recreation funds. Information on moorage demand at the level of the individual county can augment the more aggregated boating facilities needs analyses contained in the 1979 SCORP update. Because users, managers, and stewards of Washington's coastal zone resources all share an interest in the future of the moorage industry, their representatives were asked to, and willingly did, participate in an ad hoc advisory committee convened to assist researchers in conducting the study reported here. The Smallcraft Harbors Research Advisory Group (SCHRAG) met frequently between 1977 and 1981 to help scope the project, critique interim products, and review draft reports.

These changes have affected and will continue to affect the way marinas operate and prosper. Inflation and high interest rates have levied a toll on boat sales--and hence on the growth in demand for pleasure boat moorage--and have pushed construction and long-term financing costs to record high levels. Legislation proposed by the Reagan Administration would levy user charges against boaters and marina operators consuming federal waterway services: Coast Guard search and rescue and navigation aid functions and Army Corps of Engineers harbor and waterway dredging projects have been singled out for recovery of costs from users. Such changes necessitate and promote innovation and adaption on the part of the moorage industry . There are other factors, however, that have changed little since 1977. Tile same regulatory framework affecting marina development is in place: Shoreline Management, Corps of Engineers, and other permit requirements constrain development over and adjacent to waterways. Boating interests have continued to forestall state boat registration and new tax measures proposed by the state legislature. These are among the issues taken up by speakers at this workshop. Their papers form the body of these proceedings. Since 19/7 the Washington Sea Grant Program has conducted a series of studies which have better defined the recreational boating industry, its problems and opportunities, and the likely future demand for recreational and commercial fishing boat moorage. This work was supported in part by the Northwest Marine Trade Association and the Washington Public Ports Association. Both these organizations joined Washington Sea Grant in co-​sponsoring this workshop,",NA,WASHU-W-81-002,WSG-WO 82-1,A/CZ-1;A/PC-5,conference/work​shop proceedings,1981,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Boating and Moorage in the '80s: Proceedings of a Workshop,"Boating and Moorage in the '80s, Proceedings of a Workshop held at Seattle, Washington, November 4-6, 1981",NA,NA,NA,"Goodwin, Robert F.",NA81AA-D-00030

Because of the devastating effects of the 1982-83 El Nino, ocean catches of coho and chinook salmon off Oregon and Washington were the worst in recent history. Runs of several salmon stocks in Alaska, on the other hand, were at or near record highs. Salmon biologists have never been more aware of the importance of the ocean environment on salmon production than today. This workshop, held at Newport, Oregon, on November 8-10, 1983, had two major objectives: first, to review our knowledge of the effects of the ocean environment on the production of salmonid stocks of the North Pacific Ocean, emphasizing mechanisms linking interannual trends in survival, growth, and migrations with ocean variability; second, ta identify important research needs in order to develop strategies for future investigations of salmonids in the ocean.

The smoked fish manual contains five major sections of information of interest to the new or established fish smoker: plant design, kiln smoker! design, health regulations, quality control procedures, and smoking procedures.

The rapid growth in studies of this type was largely due ta attempts ta correct open access common property! problems present in existing fisheries and ta incorporate economic concepts in the management of developing fisheries. During this period the opportunity to expand management control over fisheries often came from declarations of extended fishing zones by many nations. In order to move from biological notions such as maximum sustainable yield ta bioeconomic notions of maximum economic yield, it became necessary to understand price-quantity and market structure relationships. Both descriptive and analytical studies of demand and supply, as well as market structure studies, flourished. In the United States these studies were largely sponsored by the National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS! and the newly founded National Sea Grant College Program. In other areas of the world, sponsorship was by both national and international agencies and foundations. In large part, research focused on the markets for domestically harvested species. The objectives of the conference were to learn more about the various fisheries around the world and the international trade patterns in those fisheries, to facilitate communication among individuals with interest in seafood trade questions, and to explore the possibilities of cooperative research and data exchange. Participants came from industry, governments, and the universities of 21 different countries.;Letter from President Ronald Reagan included in this document: "" I am delighted to extend my warm greetings to all those gathered for the International Seafood Trade Conference. This conference brings added recognition to some of the most critical issues facing people around the globe. With the increasing need for protein from the sea, international trade will play an especially valuable role in filling that need and feeding a hungry world. This means that we must continue to work to lower the barriers to trade in fish and shellfish and to increase cooperation in the development of our fishing industry. We must also recognize the need for effective management of the world' s living marine resources. They cannot be harvested without limit and our task is not only their more efficient utilization today but also their wide use for future generations. You have my best wishes for a productive conference and every success in the future."" (Ronald Reagan, The White House, Washington DC, August 20, 1982)","Melteff, Brenda R.

Change continues to be the order of the day at Avery Point. The decision to move toward a major marine center for education and research was made early in 1984. This decision has resulted in the creation of five State-​funded positions which are now being advertised, and a sizeable commitment for capital improvements. With the creation of the Northeast Center of the National Undersea Research Program at Avery Point in May and the commitment to an expanded and modified Marine Sciences Institute, in addition to Connecticut Sea Grant, the overall program is clearly starting to move forward. During the 1983-84 budget year, the Sea Grant program continued the two research projects on hard clam growth and oyster management which had started in 1982. In this second year of the Connecticut Sea Grant Program, we have moved much closer to NOAA and the National Sea Grant College Program, both in terms of our understanding of what Washington expects of us and in terms of their understanding of our present capabilities and future plans for Avery Point. These plans received an enormous lift from the discussions held in May between the leadership of NOAA and the University. With respect to the Connecticut Sea Grant Program, we wish to express our thanks to the National Office of Sea Grant for many hours of effort and endless patience in helping us to move toward mutual goals.","Scottron, Victor E.

This report has collected and analyzed information about a new potential industry for Washington. This information will allow DNR to better manage the public lands and associated marine resources of Washington and will also allow potential nori farmers and investors to evaluate their potential for nori aquaculture.

Why have many traditional fishery regulatory techniques survived the onslaught of theory and data that demonstrate their suboptimality? One hypothesis advanced in the fishery economics literature is a `biological bias' in the historical development of fishery management (most managers are trained in biology). But this argument does not adequately explain the prevalence of gear and vessel restrictions imposed in most regulated fisheries. The biological bias theory does not explain why fishermen would favor traditional regulations when it appears that, as a group, they would benefit under a limited entry or quota system with grandfathered rights. The following joint hypotheses are proposed as an alternative explanation: (""a"") Traditional controls do not have equal wealth effects on all fishermen and so promote wealth redistributions​. (""b"") Hence, regulations that appear to be perverse are the results of rational maximizers exploiting the political process for redistributive gains. The author argues that, not only can contracting costs inhibit the adoption of `better' regulations, but also many fishermen prefer the traditional controls precisely because the controls redistribute the catch. Thus, even when entry restrictions or quotas are adopted, they may not replace the old regulations.","Karpoff, Jonathan M.",WASHU-R-87-007,WSG-TA 87-7,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),1987,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Suboptimal controls in common resource management: the case of the fishery,"""Journal of Political Economy,"" 95(1):179-194, February 1987.

On the Pacific Coast significant rockfish resources have been depleted and are now at population levels far below their productive optima. The history of rockfish fisheries suggests that managing such resources is not easy, and that detailed information on stock sizes and biological characteristics of the species are required. Although the Pacific Ocean perch attracted early attention, the basic biological information on the various species and assessments of stock sizes and conditions have historically been sketchy, at least until the last decade.

The question of limited entry, or fleet versus resource as it is sometimes called, is one of the areas of interest for OCZMA's Oregon Fishing Industry Project. The entire project is concerned with stabilizing and revitalizing Oregon coastal communities. Certainly the topic of limited entry is one that is frequently discussed; it is a controversial topic and one that has polarized the thinking of many fishermen. There are some strong sentiments for limited entry and some equally strong feelings in opposition. The purpose of this conference was not to promote limited entry as a fishery management tool, but rather to provide industry members with an opportunity to listen firsthand to the comments of persons who have been directly involved with limited entry programs in their respective areas.

It belongs to a class of policies. To show this it is necessary to give it a proper conceptual and theoretical setting.

The governmental institution is the public port agency, a semiautonomous landlord and public relations agent that quietly builds docks or moves cargo or moors boats, acting as overseer of the waterfront. Ultimately this book asks how the institution affects the resource, and how the public port contributes to the stewardship of the urban harbor.

The rate of discard varied among species and time periods and tended to increase as trip regulations became more restrictive. The management regime failed to meet its two major goals: to conserve key species and to maintain a year-round groundfish fishery. Given the failure of the current system to meet management goals, it would appear warranted to explore some alternatives: (1) modifying the trip poundage quota system, (2) eliminating trip quotas and establishing quarterly or trimesterly quotas, (3) replacing trip poundage limits with trip time limits, (4) relying to a greater degree on gear regulations in management, (5) limiting the number of participants in the fishery, (6) modifying the objectives of management, (7) some combination of the above. This report was prepared at the request of staff of the Pacific Fishery Management Council and several of its advisory bodies in order to provide timely information to the Council on the effectiveness of past management practices.

This article uses elements of implementation theory to examine the question of how best to design nonpoint source pollution control programs and highlights the need to address two related but different types of questions: (1) what measures are capable of reducing pollutant loading when broadly applied in a particular geographic area of concern, and (2) what implementation approaches are capable of achieving sufficient levels of acceptance and utilization in the target population to assure attainment of program goals?

This model offers the important advantage of requiring information only on factors that can be easily estimated, and it yields comparative static results that can be used to assess the effects on license values of environmental or regulatory changes.","Karpoff, Jonathan M.",WASHU-R-89-009,WSG-TA 89-13,R/F-53,reprints (peer-reviewed),1989,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Characteristics of limited entry fisheries and the option component of entry licenses,"""Land Economics,"" 65(4):386-393, 1989.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the frequent changes of nets or cod ends necessitated by a randomized block design increases the workload and reduces trip revenues. Thus, the advantages of blocking need to be demonstrated in simple quantitative terms, particularly when research is to be performed under commercial operating conditions using donated vessel time. A method for estimating the sample sizes needed to reject an experimental hypothesis with a given design at a pre-set level of statistical significance and power is presented for an alternate tow gear experiment. For the specific application examined, there is a 4-10-fold reduction in sample size when randomized complete blocks are used within a vessel trip, compared with an unblocked experimental design using only one treatment type per vessel trip.","Bergh, M.

The basic question was can anadromous fishes detect and behaviorally avoid suspended sediment concentrations that may be harmful to them? Although the focus is on salmonids migrating through estuaries, some papers include information on striped bass, smelt and other anadromous fishes, as well as on riverine effects. The result is an assessment of the issues currently surrounding dredging impacts, a re-evaluation of strategies for minimal-impact dredging, and recommended approaches for evaluating and quantifying the more significant impacts. Workshop discussions centered on the biological basis for temporal and spatial limits for dredging activities that are presumed to impact anadromous fish poulations in Pacific Northwest estuaries.

This article provides an account of the participants and organizations that have influenced ocean policy development in Washington, critiques the state's new ocean law, and analyzes organizational issues to be addressed.

Japan and the U.S. wholesale markets operate in a recursive fashion, with Japan entering the market first. This type of market segmentation virtually precludes arbitraging behavior, and early entry provides substantial benefits to processors.

The butter clam ""Saxidomus giganteus"" is unique among bivalves with respects to PSPT toxicology. Neurons from the butter clam and its congener ""S. nuttalli"" were shown to be 10 to 100 times more resistant to the PSPT saxitoxin (STX) than those from 4 co-occurring infaunal bivalves. No difference in sensitivity to STX was found between butter clams from 3 sites with different histories of toxin contamination (chronically, occasionally or never toxic) suggesting that the resistance of this species to STX is innate rather than acquired with increased exposure. Because predators have been shown to reject bivalve prey contaminated with STX, long-term retention of this toxin may have been favored in the butter clam as an acquired chemical defense.","Kvitek, Rikk G.;Beitler, Mark K.",WASHU-R-91-003,WSG-TA 91-02,R/F-70,reprints (peer-reviewed),1991,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Relative insensitivity of butter clam neurons to saxitoxin: a pre-adaptation for sequestering paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins as a chemical defense,"""Marine Ecology Progress Series,"" 69:47-54, January 10, 1991.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The U.S. Maritime Administration, in cooperation with the National Research Council, has responded by developing a number of quantitative measurements for container terminal productivity. In this paper the problems and prospects of using such measurements to estimate or compare the productivity of terminals or ports are discussed. Because physical and institutional factors act to limit the productivity of every container terminal, quantitative productivity comparisons among terminals or ports may lead to misplaced efforts to improve the productivity of particular operational elements. By contrast, a sensible strategy for managing productivity would involve the linking of productivity and cost data, so that existing productivity constraints can be intelligently shifted from one area of operations to another.","Dowd, T.

The necessity for group action to achieve management goals gives nonpoint source management the characteristics of a public good.

But water quality management takes place in a political and institutional context which also provides a framework in which the differing objectives of members of society are reconciled, and policies which reflect the dominant values are developed and implemented. The success of this institutional framework management may well be related to its ability to assure that appropriate information is utilized and that important scientific uncertainties are addressed. But success may also be related to the approach these institutions take to the twin tasks of balancing competing objectives and addressing the sometimes conflicting claims of interest groups. To assess how governance arrangements have developed and evolved, this study examined three important problem areas.

This exploits the commonality among cohort members and serves as an instrumental variable, lessening the effect of measurement errors in estimation. The dynamic features of the underlying age-structured population are retained through age-specific net survivability and growth parameters that link age-classes.

Washington's voters affirmed the need for statewide shorelines management and chose the Legislature's alternative initiative to achieve it. The public-spirited efforts of those citizens, the responsiveness of their Legislature, and the leadership of their governor resulted in one of the nation's pioneering shoreline management programs. Twenty years later, more than 200 Washingtonians gathered at a symposium to celebrate two decades of shoreline management in their state, and to honor some of those responsible for the passage and implementation of the state's Shoreline Management Act of 1971. Participants in the Shorelines Management Symposium had the opportunity to learn about and assess what had been achieved under the Shoreline Management Act. They also looked ahead to the challenges the state's shoreline managers will face over the next 20 years, and considered whether or not the 20-year-old Shoreline Management Act will be sufficient to meet them.

Thirty years ago there was already a vast literature on salmonids. There is even more today. Most of the studies, however, concern the freshwater phase of salmonid life histories and biology. This book addresses questions concerning the ecology of Pacific salmonids at sea, relevant to all seven anadromous species of ""Oncorhynchus"" (five salmon and two trout) found in the northeastern Pacific. The focus is on processes that affect growth and survival in the ocean, as the author attempts to establish a connection between salmonid ecology and the physical and biological oceanography of that Pacific region. The first chapter, on phylogeny and anadromy of salmonids, covers freshwater and marine life histories. Then the organization of the book follows the sequence of salmonid migrations into the ocean: the timing of outmigration, the importance of estuaries, and survival in fresh and marine waters. The final chapter describes salmonid migrations in both coastal and oceanic waters, and possible guidance mechanisms.","Pearcy, William G.",WASHU-B-92-001,WSG-IS 92-01,E/FO-3;A/PC-5,books,1992,University of Washington Press,Washington Sea Grant,Ocean Ecology of North Pacific Salmonids,NA,NA,NA,Books in Recruitment Fishery Oceanography,NA,NA89AA-D-SG022

As a result of increasing consumer demand for seafood, the need for stock enhancement programs, the growth of aquaculture, the marine bait and tropical fish industries and the pursuit of scientific research, the number of marine introductions and transfers has increased. Concern over the deliberate movements of marine organisms is the possible introduction of diseases, parasites, competitors and predators not presently indigenous to the receiving environment. However, history has demonstrated that for some species, introductions can prove socially and economically beneficial. It is not surprising, therefore, that the introduction, transfer or release of marine species has led to strong debate about the relative benefits and risks, and in some cases has resulted in prohibitive management measures. The apparent lack of information available to decision-​makers, extension personnel and the public and private sectors has fueled the debate.

The short-term effects of mesh size regulations are felt in the immediate catch and revenues of the fishery. However, the long- term effects ultimately determine the population dynamics of the stock and economic future of the fishery. The driving force behind mesh size regulations is the size selectivity exerted by the gear and the net productivity of the fish stock escaping harvest. Hence, determination of the relative selectivity of one mesh type to that of another is important in predicting the consequence of changes in mesh regulations. The purpose of this paper is to present a nonparametric maximum likelihood (NMLE) method of estimating mesh selectivity coefficients. Using multinomial likelihood models, selectivity can be estimated for discrete size classes making minimal assumptions about the selectivity process and underlying model for the selectivity curve. General curve fitting routines can subsequently be used to investigate the functional relationship between fish size and selectivity.","Skalski, John R.;Perez-Comas, Jose Antonio",WASHU-R-93-009,WSG-TA 94-03,R/F-91,reprints (peer-reviewed),1993,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation of mesh size selectivity,"""Fisheries Research,"" 18:321-334, 1993.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Alaska, which was once the dominant supplier of salmon worldwide, was losing its hold on salmon markets. In response, the state of Alaska developed an extensive salmon hatchery program designed to create a stream of revenue from this valuable renewable resource. However, since 1988 Alaska salmon prices have steadily declined. A revenue analysis was performed to examine the effects of various salmon enhancement production levels on future revenue generated to salmon fishers working in Alaska waters. The results were then used in a cost/benefit analysis of the state's enhancement program for sockeye, chinook, coho, chum, and pink salmon. This report focuses on the two most important Alaska salmon species, sockeye and pink. Results of the revenue analysis indicate that for sockeye salmon, future revenues would increase if output from salmon enhancement were expanded. For pink salmon, revenues would decrease if salmon enhancement were expanded and increase if salmon enhancement were scaled back. However, a complete elimination of the pink hatchery program would decrease revenues. For both species, there are important regional differences.","Herrmann, Mark",WASHU-R-93-018,WSG-TA 95-04,R/14-13,reprints (peer-reviewed),1993,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Using an international econometric model to forecast Alaska salmon revenues,"""Marine Resource Economics,"" 8:249-271, 1993.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because aspects of the ""C. magister"" life history are consistent with those of other commercially or ecologically important species, its recruitment mechanism may be representative of a larger group of coastal upwelling species and may thus provide insight beyond the present context. Analyses suggest that larvae in near-surface waters are advected considerable (and variable) distances alongshore, while being maintained close to shore and close to suitable juvenile habitat. This model contrasts with the prevailing paradigm for the species, which suggests that zoeae undergo progressive seaward transport after hatching followed by cross-shelf return of megalopae before settlement. Given the expected changes in temperature, salinity, and pH for the northeastern Pacific and the functional relationship between larval transport and year-class strength, indirect effects of greenhouse warming on coastal circulation will be most significant to ""C. magister"" populations.","McConnaughey, Robert A.;Armstrong, David A.",WASHU-R-95-008,WSG-TA 95-17,R/F-68,reprints (peer-reviewed),1995,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Potential effects of global climate change on Dungeness crab (""Cancer magister"") populations in the northeastern Pacific Ocean","Canadian Special Publication of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 121:291-306, 1995",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study applies the rationale of diet choice theory to high-grading behavior in the Oregon trawl fishery by treating fishermen as foragers who must decide how much of each net's haul to `ingest' before searching for more prey. A state-​dependent, temporal model of discarding behavior within a fishing trip is derived. This optimization considers the availability of differently valued fish, trip quotas set by the regulatory agency, and the risk of premature trip termination due to loss of gear or injury. The results indicate that those parameters affect discarding behavior through their effect on the probability of exceeding the allowable catch, which was considered analogous to gut capacity. High-grading (partial prey consumption) occurred throughout many simulated trips. The predictions were consistent with the trends in discarding observed in the Oregon trawl fleet.","Gillis, Darren M.;Pikitch, Ellen K.;Peterman, Randall M.",WASHU-R-95-009,WSG-TA 95-18,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),1995,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Dynamic discarding decisions: foraging theory for high-grading in a trawl fishery,"""Behavioral Ecology,"" 6(2):146-154, 1995.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With the increasing notoriety of shellfish-​related illnesses and even deaths, the shellfish industry has suffered a decline in sales.

This is a process in which oysters are placed in tanks of sterilized, flowing seawater where their natural pumping action purges the animal of gut contents and pathogens. Currently, depuration is not widely practiced in the U.S. In order for depuration to have any significant impact on risk reduction, there must exist adequate economic incentives for the industry to adopt the technology and to offer the potentially safer product to the market.

Three basic tools to reduce seabird bycatch are identified: abundance-based management, alternative gear, and time-of-day.","Melvin, Edward F.;Conquest, Loveday L.;Parrish, Julia K.",WASHU-T-97-001,WSG AS 97-01,A/FP-7,technical reports/surveys​/patents,1997,U of Washington Sea Grant,Washington Sea Grant,Seabird bycatch reduction: new tools for Puget Sound drift gillnet salmon fisheries. 1996 sockeye and 1995 chum salmon test fisheries final report,NA,NA,NA,Removed no longer working URL provided.,NA,NOAA Sea Grant

Because it is such a complicated issue, it would be unusual to find a BMP that describes both the risks and benefits of becoming a 'Small Quantity Generator.'

The line between being an environmental showcase and being subject to severe EPA penalties is narrow, vague, and easy to cross unawares.

Aquaculture operations and particularly on- bottom oyster culture require substrate that is sufficiently firm (compact) to support the weight of growing oysters and prevent mortality from sinking and suffocation. Burrowing activity by the shrimp reduces substrate compaction, causing oysters to sink into the altered substrate or to be smothered by sediment. From the outset of a large-scale shrimp control program in Washington in 1963 until 1984, carbaryl was applied at 11.2 kg/ha. With increased use and increased public concern over its use, the Washington Department of Fisheries began experiments to investigate the potential for decreasing the amount of chemical introduced into the environment by reducing the application rate. The experiments reported here represent a more detailed exploration of carbaryl application rate, with the explicit objective of linking control to ecology of the two shrimp species.

The need for protecting, preserving, and restoring these valuable ecosystems was a major factor in passage of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) in 1972. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of state Coastal Management Programs (CMPs) in protecting estuaries and coastal wetlands. Data collection and state profile development were based on published information, structured interviews with state officials, and unpublished information from reports, permit tracking databases, and other sources. Once all available data for the twenty-nine states were collected and state CZM profiles developed, individual state programs were evaluated for effectiveness in a four-step, structured process. To the extent that outcome data were available (it was meager in many cases), it was found that state CMPs are relatively effective. Among the various management tools used by states, regulatory programs rated the highest for their contributions to estuary and coastal wetland protection. But a variety of other strategies and tools, many built around state-local planning partnerships, also contributed significantly. State CMP weaknesses were also apparent, including a general lack of organized outcome monitoring. The following papers are included in this publication: 1.

Examination of how metabolic diversity is generated in natural systems should provide insight into engineering a wide range of novel molecules through combinatorial biosynthesis.

Among prokaryotes, genes are commonly regulated at the transciptional level by ""two compartment,"" or ""His-Asp,"" signal transducers, consisting of a ""sensor kinase,"" which autophosphoryla​tes at a conserved histidine residue, and a cognate response regulator, which is phosphorylated by the sensor kinase at the conserved aspartate residue. A putative His-Asp response regulator gene, ""trg1"" (transcriptiona​l regulatory gene 1), has been identified in the estuarine raphidophytic alga ""Heterosigma akashiwo."" Homology searches suggest that ""Heterosigma trg1"" has an ""ompR""-like identity within the DNA-binding His-Asp family of response regulators. ""Trg1"" contains both the phosphorylation and DNA binding domains which are present in prokaryote response regulators. Quantitative competitive RT-PCR showed that ""Heterosigma trg1"" is expressed at low levels. In contrast, ""psbA"" (a photosystem II component) transcript is abundant. Cell cycle analysis showed that ""psbA"" abundance oscillates in response to light but ""trg1"" mRNA levels are invariant.

The authors examine the additional possibility that Fsph DNase damages host DNA and signals the induction of defense responses via this route.","Klosterman, Steven J.;Chen, Junping;Choi, Jane J.;Chinn, Ellen E.;Hadwiger, Lee A.",WASHU-R-01-015,WSG-TA 02-09,R/B-38,reprints (peer-reviewed),2001,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Characterizatio​n of a 20 kDa DNase elicitor from ""Fusarium solani"" f. sp.

Because of its location just north of the Columbia River, the estuary has both river plume and upwelling influences. The comprehensive dataset is unique in that it has sufficient spatial resolution to trace water property changes from the coast up the estuary, to estimate the rate of progression as well as the modifying effect of the intrusion on along-estuary density gradients and estuarine residual velocities, and to determine the dominant mechanisms responsible for the up-estuary advance of the coastal water.","Hickey, B.

When wave energy is insufficient to mobilize sediment further, deposition and accumulation occur.

The degree to which physical forcing plays a dominant role and the mechanisms of effect remain unclear. Here scientists test the relationship between measures of oceanographic and atmospheric forcing and the response of populations of a ubiquitous seabird of the Pacific Northwest, the common murre ""Uria aalge"". They constructed two models: an annualized bottom-up model that examines the degree to which population response variables, including population size, breeding success, and foraging parameters, are correlated with oceanographic forcing at space and time scales relevant to murre biology; and a daily direct forcing model that examines the degree to which diet choices reflect specific, local oceanographic signals. The bottom-up model suggests that murres are regulated by bottom-up forcing, and that the strength of the association between physical change and population response may be mediated by density dependence. The direct forcing model indicated that chick diet is affected by both local and remote parameters, including upwelling, tide, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

Ocean ecosystems are complex and have been very difficult to manage, as evidenced by the collapses of many large-scale fisheries (Boreman et al. 1999; Ludwig et al., 1993; National Research Council, 1999). A large part of the problem arises from scientific uncertainty and our understanding of the nature of that uncertainty. The difficulty of the scientific problem in a complex, quickly changing, and highly adaptive environment such as the ocean should not be underestimated. It has created pervasive uncertainty that has been magnified by the strategic behavior of the various human interests who play in the game of fisheries management. This paper argues that scientific uncertainty in complex systems creates a more difficult conservation problem than necessary because (1) we have built into our governing institutions a very particular and inappropriate scientific conception of the ocean that assumes much more control over natural processes than we might hope to have (i.e., we assume we are dealing with an analog of simple physical systems), and (2) the individual incentives that result from this fiction, even in the best of circumstances, are not aligned with social goals of sustainability. As a result, the author believes we have slowed significantly the process of learning about the ocean, defined scientific uncertainty and precautionary acts in a way that may turn out to be highly risky, and created dysfunctional management institutions. This chapter suggests we are more likely to find ways to align individual incentives with ecosystem sustainability if we begin to view these systems as complex adaptive systems. This perspective alters especially our sense of the extent and kind of control we might exercise in these systems and, as a result, has strong implications for the kinds of individual rights and collective governance structures that might work.","Wilson, James",MEU-R-02-007,MSG-R-02-05,R/FMD-239,reprints (peer-reviewed),2002,National Research Council,Maine Sea Grant,"Scientific uncertainty, complex systems, and the design of common-pool institutions","""The Drama of the Commons,"" Committee on the Human Dimensions of Global Change.

The small larval size of many marine species presents significant challenges to culture, however, these highly valuable fish offer considerable promise for aquaculture. A particularly attractive group for marine aquaculture is the flatfish. The California halibut, ""Paralichthys californicus,"" with a range in nature from Washington State south to Baja California Sur, Mexico is one such species. With the goal of enhancing the fishery for this species, a hatchery program was developed over a decade ago. The hatchery at Redondo Beach, California, maintains a group of adults that routinely spawn throughout most of each year. Further development of routine culture and juvenile growout techniques ultimately aimed at commercial aquaculture was initiated last year with support from the California Sea Grant College Program. Profitable commercial ventures culturing various flatfish species already exist in other parts of the world, but development of a flatfish culture industry in California confronts unique challenges. Two challenges in particular are the relatively high cost of energy and stringent environmental regulations. To meet these challenges a culture system built around recirculation technology is being developed that would allow for an energy-​efficient industrial-like approach to the culture of California halibut while minimizing environmental impacts.","Conklin, Douglas E.;Piedrahita, Raul H.;Merino, German E.;Muguet, Jean-Benoit;Bush, Douglas E.;Gisbert, Enric;Rounds, James;Cervantes-​Trujano, Margarita",CASG-R-03-040,NA,R/A-116,reprints (peer-reviewed),2003,NA,California Sea Grant,"Development of California halibut, ""Paralichthys californicus,"" culture","""Journal of Applied Aquaculture,"" 14(3/4):143-​154, 2003.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, Washington State has a long-term moratorium on commercial seaweed harvesting from wild populations so there is renewed interest in intensive cultivation of this species. The initial phase of this research was conducted at Mukilteo, Washington. There, strategies for long-term cultivation in tanks were tested, and a custom cultivation tank design was developed for pilot scale cultivation research on a site on the shore of Clam Bay near Manchester, Washington. Long-term cultivation is now being tested in tanks of up to 5000 L volume supplied with natural seawater, seawater supplemented with nutrients, and seawater effluent from nearby Pacific Halibut culture tanks. Seawater from Clam Bay is naturally rich in nutrients from tidal drive upwelling and nearby commercial salmon mariculture operations. Supplemental nutrients (commercially available ""f/2"" enrichment) and halibut culture tank effluent have both been tested for their ability to support ""C. exasperatus"" growth with relatively low seawater turnover rates. Compared to seawater at the site, Halibut tank effluent differs in both nutrient composition and quantities.

To explore the issue further, the authors measured various chemical and bacterial parameters in the near 0 degrees Centigrade waters of the North Water during the months of May and July of 1998. Seawater (SW) samples were collected by Niskin bottle at the depth of the chlorophyll fluorescence maximum (8-90m), while samples of sinking particles and aggregates were collected in short-term (0.5- 1 .2d), unpoisoned, floating sediment traps deployed at depths typically below the mixed layer (50-136m). Samples were analyzed for POC, PON, and abundance of total and actively respiring bacteria. They were also incubated with fluorescently tagged substrate analogs to measure potential maximal rates of three classes of EE (leucine-​aminopeptidase, chitobiase, and 13-glucosidase) at -1 degree Centigrade. The percentage of actively respiring bacteria was always higher in sediment trap samples than in SW (medians of 38% and 24% versus 10% and 12% in May and July, respectively.) Cell- specific rates of EEA were also higher in the trap samples and, for both sample types, similar to published rates from temperate waters. Rates of EEA when scaled to the abundance of actively respiring bacteria, however, did not differ between sample types, suggesting that the elevated EEA associated with sinking material is due to the greater abundance of metabolically active cells supported by such material and not due to enhanced enzyme expression in general, as suggested by previous studies. In this study, leucine-​aminopeptidase activity was always much higher than the other classes of EEA, becoming even more dominant later in the season; it always correlated positively with the abundance of both total and actively respiring bacteria. Enzyme ratios indicating proteases dominance corresponded with the seasonal increases in C/N ratios of both suspended and sinking POM. Overall the results suggest bacterial responses to seasonal changes in POM quality through differential expression of EE and an important role for proteases in influencing the nitrogen content of organic matter even at near -0 degree temperatures in this polynya.","Huston, A.

The authors found 3 highly pathogenic strains and 1 mildly pathogenic strain among 33 isolates tested. These strains appear to be members of the genus ""Vibrio"". Although there have been many studies of bivalve bacterial pathogens, a standard method to assess bacterial pathogenicity in bivalve larvae is needed. Thus, the authors developed two methods using either 15 ml conical tubes or tissue culture plates that were employed for rapidly screening bacterial strains for pathogenicity to Pacific oyster larvae. The tissue culture plates worked well for screening both mildly pathogenic strains and LD(50)(lethal doses) assays. This method allowed for non- intrusive and non-destructive observation of the oyster larvae with a dissecting microscope. The LD(50) for the three highly pathogenic strains ranged between 1.6 and 3.6 x 1004 colony forming units (CFU) ml^-1 after 24 h and between 3.2 x 10^2 and 1.9 x 10^3CFU ml^-1 after 48h.","Estes, Robyn M.;Friedman, Carolyn S.;Elston, Ralph A.;Herwig, Russell P.",WASHU-R-04-006,WSG-TA 04-06,R/A-82,reprints (peer-reviewed),2004,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Pathogenicity testing of shellfish hatchery bacterial isolates on Pacific oyster ""Crassostrea gigas"" larvae","""Diseases of Aquatic Organisms,"" 58:223-230, March 10, 2004.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

""Heterosigma"" cells are capable of rapid canes between at least two active swimming modes, distinguishable by the magnitude of the oscillatory component o motion.

A spatially explicit model of vertical distribution of ""Heterosigma"" cells based on strain-specific motility data suggests that cells of the two strains may diverge in water-column position within a few hours and that CCAP934-1 develops dense surface aggregations more rapidly and more robustly than CCMP452.

Fluctuating ocean conditions-​-​alternations between wind-driven upwelling and downwelling, and intrusions of the buoyant Columbia River plume--are shown to force order-​of-​magnitude changes in salinity gradients on the event (2-10 day) scale. An effective horizontal diffusivity parameterizing all up-estuary salt flux is calculated as a function of riverflow: results show that Willapa's volume-​integrated salt balance is almost always far from equilibrium. At very high riverflows (the top 15% of observations) the estuary loses salt, on average; while at all other riverflow levels it gains salt. Under summer, low-riverflow conditions, in fact, the effective diffusivity K is large enough to drive a net increase in salinity that is 3-6 times the seaward, river- driven salt flux. This diffusion process is amplified, not damped, by increased tidal forcing, contrary to the expectation for baroclinic exchange. Furthermore, K varies along the length of the estuary as approximately 5% of the rms tidal velocity times channel width, a scaling consistent with density-​dependent stirring by tidal residuals. To summarize Willapa's event--and seasonal-- scale variability, a simple diagnostic parameter space for unsteady estuarine salt balances is presented, a generalization from the Hansen and Rattray steady-state scheme.","Banas, N.

The author used a combination of field- and laboratory-​based research approaches to investigate factors that may influence the activity of bacterial EE in stably-cold marine environments. Chapters two and three describe the results of experiments performed while participating in the international North Water Polynya Study. The results of the field campaign significantly increased the number of psychrophilic EE activities (thermal optima less than or equal to 15 degrees Centigrade) documented in natural habitats (12 of 42 cases, with optima to unprecedented lows of 10 degrees Centigrade), established an important role for EE in influencing the content of organic matter despite the near -0 degree Centigrade conditions, and suggested that sinking aggregates preferentially select for psychrophilic bacteria and cold-active EE relative to surround seawater. These field studies also underscored the need to establish a model EE-producing psychrophilic bacterium to better understand the factors affecting bacterial expression, activity, and hydrolytic lifetime of EE. The material in chapter four describes the characterizatio​n of marine psychrophile ""Colwellia psychrerythraea​"" strain 34H, isolated from the near-freezing sediments of the Northeast Water Polynya, Greenland. Strain 34H was chosen as the model organism for my studies because it consistently yielded an extract of cell-free aminopeptidase with activity optimized at 20 degrees Centigrade, the lowest optimum yet reported for cell-free EEA from a pure culture. The purification, characterizatio​n and structural studies of the cold-active M1-family aminopeptidase (MAP) expressed by strain 34H are reported in chapter five. In agreement with previous studies of cold-active enzymes, MAP displayed high activity at low temperatures (approximately 0 degrees Centigrade), low thermal optima for activity (19 degrees Centigrade), low stability against denaturing agents, and amino acid changes which hypothetically lead to increased structural flexibility when compared to mesophilic homologs. Additional research indicated that extrinsic stabilizing factors, such as exopolymeric substances, significantly affected the activity and lifetime of MAP. Overall, this dissertation enhanced knowledge of activity characteristics and structure-​function relationships of cold-active enzymes in general, while indicating the importance of extrinsic stabilizing factors for maintaining cold-active EEA in the environment.","Huston, Adrienne Louisa",WASHU-X-03-006,WSG-TH 04-03,R/B-35,theses/disserta​tions,2003,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Bacterial adaptation to the cold: in situ activities of extracellular enzymes in the North Water Polynya and characterizatio​n of a cold-active aminopeptidase from ""Colwellia psychrerythraea​"" strain (abstract only)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The non-host resistance response in pea appeared to involve multiple signaling routes, resulting in the transcription of the following pea genes: HMG I/Y (an AT hook protein which binds AT rich regions in promoter sequences regulating the genes), DRR206 and PR10 (accumulate in response to infection), and phenylalanine ammonia lyase and chalcone synthase (active enzymes in the phytoalexin pisatin synthesis pathway). In subsequent work, the major players in these multiple signaling pathways were reinvestigated by challenging pea tissue with an array of commercially available inhibitors of vital cell processes. It was found that the specific inhibitors of phosphatases were very efficient at inducing the synthesis of the phytoalexin pisatin. This present study evaluates how such signal disruption influences the gene activity of the immune response. The mRNA levels of these 5 genes were monitored following the challenge of the pea tissue with the phosphatase inhibitors, calyculin A and okadaic acid. Extremely low concentrations (as low as 4 pg/upsilon l) of these inhibitors induced copious quantities of pisatin (up to 533 upsilon g/g)) and caused increases in the mRNA specific for the 5 defense genes. It was previously determined that the level of the mRNA for the HMG I/Y gene was often low when the pea defense response was activated. To determine if the promoter of the HMG I/Y gene had AT- rich regions that could become a target of its own AT-rich hooks, a strategy was developed which was successful in identifying the DNA sequence of its promoter region. This region did indeed contain many AT-rich regions. Also, siRNAs were employed to specifically suppress HMG I/Y mRNA. The suppression of HMG I/Y was inefficient probably because of the difficulty in getting 25 bp oligomers to all their target cells in the multiple cell layers of the pea endocarp tissue.","Carson, Jennifer Ann",WASHU-X-04-002,WSG-TH 04-05,R/B-38,theses/disserta​tions,2004,NA,Washington Sea Grant,The role of nuclear proteins and signal inhibitors in the defense response of pea (abstract only),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-wa-csv/5991142_1842_2818879.csv,1,"Recent studies strongly suggest the existence of a subseafloor biosphere at mid-ocean ridges, yet little is known about the diversity of bacteria and archaea in the subseafloor, how perturbations such as eruptive events affect the microbial community, if off-axis subseafloor environments host a biosphere, and the distribution of subseafloor populations in individual vents. In order to address such issues, this thesis predicts that the physiological and phylogenetic diversity of microbes in low temperature hydrothermal diffuse fluids can be used to further describe and understand the subseafloor environment. Two contrasting subseafloor environments are examined, Axial Seamount and Baby Bare Seamount, both located in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The former is a young active mid-ocean ridge volcano with magma-driven fluid circulation, while the latter is a sedimented outcrop located on 3.5 Ma oceanic crust. The thesis is divided into four main topics focused on the subseafloor. First, an examination of the temporal changes in bacterial diversity and geochemistry in the subseafloor at Axial in response to an eruptive event found an increase both in the overall bacterial diversity in vent fluids n and in the microbes that appear to be indigenous to the vent environment, such as the ""epsilon""-​proteobacteria. Second, the application of a combination of molecular analyses, culturing, and geochemical signatures of fluids determined that a unique subseafloor population of microbes does exist in Baby Bare crustal fluids, consisting of thermophiles belonging to the ""Thermosipho"" spp., ""Thermococcales​"" spp., and ""Desulfurobacte​rium"" spp., as well as novel uncultured archaea not detected at Axial. Third, key physiological characteristics of a novel cultured microorganism from diffuse fluids were identified, such as exopolysacchari​de production and autotrophy, and indicate adaptation to subseafloor habitats. Finally, a group of subseafloor indicator organisms belonging to the ""Thermococcales​"" were isolated from multiple vent sites and studied using culturing and molecular methods to determine their in-situ diversity and distribution. These microbiological data in combination with the geochemical properties of diffuse fluids allow us to further constrain the subseafloor ecosystem in both mid-ocean ridge and off-axis seamounts.","Huber, Julie A.",WASHU-X-04-003,WSG-TH 05-03,R/B-36,theses/disserta​tions,2004,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Phylogenetic and physiological diversity of subseafloor microbial communities at deep-sea seamounts (abstract only),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In particular, the authors investigate the management program designed to eradicate the English cordgrass, ""Spartina anglica"" C. E. Hubbard, in marine intertidal habitats of Puget Sound, Washington, United States. Observational and manipulative experiments were used to measure the regrowth (vegetative growth), reinvasion (seedling recruitment), and restoration potential (return to native condition) of invaded habitats. Removal regime (consistent: yearly removal; interrupted: yearly removal with the last year missed) and habitat type (low salinity marsh, mudflat, cobble beach, and high salinity marsh sites) were considered. The response to removal regime was dramatic. Under consistent removal, cordgrass slowly declined but under interrupted removal, there was substantial regrowth of the invader. This pattern results from the resiliency of belowground biomass and the subsequent high aboveground productivity and seedling growth of ""S. anglica"". The authors also found that removal success depended on differences among sites that represent different habitat types. Cordgrass regrowth and reinvasion were substantially higher in the low salinity marsh sites where soils have lower salinity. They also found that at the low salinity marsh sites, some restoration of native plants and soil conditions was evident. At mudflat, cobble beach, and high salinity marsh sites, colonization of native vascular plants and algae not normally present in the absence of the invasion, occurred.

However, blanket protection of species within a reserve may shelter nonindigenous species that are normally affected by harvesting, intensifying their impacts on native species. The author has studied a system of marine reserves in the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA, to examine the extent to which marine reserves are invaded by nonindigenous species and the consequences of these invasions on native species. The author surveyed three reserves and eight non-reserves to quantify the abundance of intertidal suspension-​feeding clam species, three of which are regionally widespread nonindigenous species (""Nuttallia obscurata,"" ""Mya arenaria,"" and ""Venerupis philippinarum"")​. Neither total nonindigenous nor native species' abundance was significantly greater on reserves. However, the most heavily harvested species, ""V. philippinarum,"" was significantly more abundant on reserves, with the three reserves ranking highest in ""Venerupis"" biomass of all 11 sites. In contrast, a similar, harvested native species (""Protothaca staminea"") did not differ between reserves and non-reserves. The author followed these surveys with a year-long field experiment replicated at six sites (the three reserves and three of the surveyed non-reserve sites). The experiment examined the effects of high ""Venerupis"" densities on mortality, growth, and fecundity of the confamilial ""Protothaca,"" and whether differences in predator abundance mitigate density-​dependent effects. Even at densities 50% higher than measured in the field survey, ""Venerupis"" had no direct effect on itself or ""Prorothaca""; only site, predator exposure, and their interaction had significant effects. Analyses incorporating environmental variables tracked at each site indicated that crab biomass most heavily influenced clam responses, causing lower growth of both species and higher mortality of ""Venerupis,"" whose annualized loss rate was 50% when exposed to predators. A laboratory prey choice experiment indicated that ""Cancer productus,"" an influential intertidal crab predator, favored small adult ""Venerupis"" at least 1.7 times over ""Protothaca"". ""Venerupis'"" high susceptibility to excavating crab and human predators, as well as its faster growth compared to ""Protothaca"" can be explained by its shallower burial depth. By growing quickly and residing near the surface, ""Venerupis"" apparently absorbs the brunt of harvest pressure while ""Protothaca"" maintains high biomass even outside of reserves.","Byers, James E.",WASHU-R-05-001,WSG-TA 05-01,R/ES-39,reprints (peer-reviewed),2005,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Marine reserves enhance abundance but not competitive impacts of a harvested nonindigenous species,"Ecology, 86(2):487-500, 2005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ecological roles of LWD for support of juvenile salmon were explored in natural and created oligohaline-​brackish estuarine sloughs on the Chehalis River, Washington, USA. Relationships were examined between LWD and migrating juvenile chum and chinook salmon (""Oncorhynchus keta,"" ""O. tschawytscha"") and LWS and invertebrates. Sediment characteristics related to LWD and spatial dynamics (movement; complexity as determined by Area:perimeter ratios) of LWD were investigated. Results suggest that LWD in estuarine sloughs is not a major factor supporting juvenile salmon, prey times, or unique invertebrate groups. Fish densities did not relate to wood surface area of total fish or salmonids. Invertebrate density differences in Near- and Away-from LWD areas (Near=within 0.25 m, Away=further than >2m) were not observed, nor were there major differences in invertebrate assemblages. LWD-surfaces contained proportionally more isopods, chironomid larvae, tanaids, and bivalves and less polychaetes compared to benthic sediments. Sediment deposition rates, grain sizes, and organic content in Near- and Away-from LWD areas did not differ. Wood abundance did not change considerably and a small proportion of LWD moved over the seven-year time interval. Wood type, slough, and bank location did not determine LWD complexity change, and LWD changes did not differ in the natural vs. created slough. Extrapolation of the role of riverine to estuarine LWD was valid for LWD providing substrate for invertebrates, but not for direct fish habitat or sedimentation. However, uncertainty still exists about estuarine LWD and its direct support of biota, and restoration projects may do well to take into account the cost of considering LWD in the context of project goals. Given widespread reduction of LWD in coastal systems, LWD in estuarine systems should not be discounted for functions promoting habitat quality, especially because the potential importance of LWD on larger scales and in other estuarine areas remains unexplored. Further studies could investigate more areas within estuaries (e.g. marshes), multiple estuarine systems, and other temporal scales.","Wick, Alicia J.",WASHU-X-02-007,WSG-TH 05-02,R/ES-41,theses/disserta​tions,2002,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Ecological function and spatial dynamics of large woody debris in oligohaline-​brackish estuarine sloughs for juvenile Pacific salmon (abstract only),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Two distinct allelic lineages were detected in pollock, resulting from three amino acid replacement mutations in the first intravesicular domain of the protein. The common ""Pan"" I allelic group, comprising 94% of the samples, was less polymorphic (71 = 0.005) than the uncommon group (71 = 0.008), and nucleotide diversity in both was higher than for two allelic lineages in the related Atlantic cod, ""Gadus morhua."" Phylogenetic analyses of ""Pan"" I sequences from these two species did not clearly resolve orthology among allelic groups, in part because of recombination that has occurred between the two pollock lineages. Conventional tests of neutrality comparing polymorphisms within and between homologous regions of the ""Pan"" I locus in walleye pollock and Atlantic cod did not detect the effects of selection. This result is likely attributed to low levels of synonymous divergence among allelic lineages and a lack of mutation- drift equilibrium inferred from nucleotide mismatch frequency distributions. However, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site (dN/dS) exceeded unity in two intravesicular domains of the protein and the influence of positive selection at multiple codon sites was strongly inferred through the use of maximum- likelihood analyses. In addition, the frequency spectrum of linked neutral variation showed indirect effects of adaptive hitchhiking in pollock resulting from a selective sweep of the common allelic lineage. Recombination between the two allelic classes may have prevented complete loss of the older, more polymorphic lineage.

Riparian areas have been studied intensely in recent years because of their critical functional relationships to stream and freshwater wetland ecosystems. Marine riparian areas, on the other hand, have received little attention. Although marine riparian systems have not been subject to the same level of scientific investigation, a growing body of evidence suggests that riparian systems serve similar functions regardless of the salinity of the water bodies they border. While riparian areas and shoreline vegetation have been identified as integral and important parts of the marine nearshore ecosystem, their functions and benefits have not been adequately evaluated and integrated into shoreline management strategies. Recognizing this gap in our knowledge and the apparent links between shoreline vegetation and the nearshore ecosystem based on personal observations, the authors began an investigation with a preliminary review of the scientific literature and interviews with other marine scientists.

In the present study, the authors investigated whether or not near-zero Arctic environments contain extracellular enzymes with activity optimized to temperatures lower than previously reported. By applying fluorescently tagged substrate analogues to measure leucine-​aminopeptidase and chitobiase activity, the occurrence of extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) with remarkably low temperature optima (15 deg C) was documented in sea-ice samples. An extremely psychrophilic bacterial isolate, strain 34H, yielded an extract of cell-free protease with activity optimized at 20 deg C, the lowest optimum yet reported for cell-free EEA from a pure culture. The use of zymogram gels revealed the presence of three proteolytic bands (between 37 and 45 kDa) in the extract and the release of the greatest quantities of the proteases when the strain was grown at -1 deg C, suggesting a bacterial strategy for counteracting the effects of very cold temperatures on the catalytic efficiency of released enzymes. The detection of unusually cold-adapted EEA in environmental samples has ramifications not only to polar ecosystems and carbon cycling but also to protein evolution, biotechnology and bioremediation.","Huston, Adrienne L.;Krieger-​Brockett, Barbara B.;Deming, Jody W.",WASHU-R-00-018,WSG-TA 05-09,R/B-17,reprints (peer-reviewed),2000,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Remarkably low temperature optima for extracellular enzyme activity from Arctic bacteria and sea ice,"""Environmental Microbiology,"" 2(4):383-388, 2000.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here the authors provide an overview of the published literature on NIS zooplankton, separated by life history (holoplankton vs. meroplankton), habitat (marine, estuarine, freshwater), and biological level of organization or topic (e.g. distribution and range extension, physiology, behavior, feeding, community impacts, ecosystem dynamics, etc.). Amongst the many findings generated by their literature search, perhaps the most striking is the paucity of studies on community and ecosystem level impacts of NIS zooplankton, especially in marine and estuarine systems. They also present some results from two ongoing studies of invasive zooplankton in the northeast Pacific Ocean -- ""Pseudodiaptomu​s inopinus"" in Washington and Oregon coastal estuaries, and ""Tortanus dextrilobatus"" in San Francisco Bay. Both of these Asian copepods have recently expanded their range and can at times be extremely abundant (10^3m^- 3). The authors also examine some aspects of the trophic (predator-prey) ecology of these two invasive copepods, and find that they are likely to be important in the flow of material and energy in the systems in which they now pervade, although their impacts at the ecosystem level remain to be quantified.

The low-temperature reactions include production of methane, ammonia and particulate elemental sulfur, oxidation of hydrogen sulfide, nitrate reduction, stripping of metals from seawater, and reactions that dissolve iron and produce alkalinity. High concentrations of CO2 from magmatic degassing maintain acidic pH conditions and may be important in promoting low-temperature hydrolysis reactions.

This paper analyzes the numerical contribution, or influence, of categories of conditions, such as bacterial adaptive state, electron acceptor type, mixing, generalized sorption conditions/ and biodegradation temperature, on published phenanthrene biodegradation rates as an example of the authors' regression approach. A fundamental microbial degradation rate equation is transformed to an additive model, then using multiple linear regression on published data, coefficients (of categorical variables) and a linear model are presented that estimate first-order biodegradation rate coefficients to within a factor of 3. Numerical estimates of how much bacterial adaptive state and presence of a sorption phase, the two most statistically significant factors, alter the phenanthrene biodegradation rate are presented. The influence of some measurement or field conditions, for example, the influence of oxygen reduction versus optimal nitrate reduction, cannot be distinguished statistically given the available data and range. The regression model is tested using conditions from newly published papers to estimate a priori the expected rate, which compares very favorably to measurements reported in the papers. Due to limited published data and range for extreme cases, the current coefficients do not apply to degradation of very aged phenanthrene nor very low concentrations of electron acceptors. As estimating tools, however, the coefficients themselves and the regression approach have very beneficial roles in design of experiments for both laboratory and field settings.

Based on biological data alone (elasticities of matrix population models), effective control strategies are sensitive to both life history and rate of population growth. Adding economic considerations, however, can cause the optimal control strategy to shift, unless the costs of intervention are the same across life stages. As an example, the authors apply their methods to oyster drills (""Ocinebrellus inornatus""), an economically important aquaculture pest that has been accidentally introduced worldwide.

Objectives of the statute are to address water resource and water quality issues, salmon habitat needs and to establish instream flows. This exploratory study sought to examine two aspects of how local governments are implementing the Act: challenges and benefits associated with collaborative watershed planning and the capacity of local governments to conduct collaborative watershed planning. Using documents and interview data from four cases, it was found that all planning groups experience similar challenges, although newer planning groups experienced more challenges than groups with previous planning experience. Challenges include issues surrounding the collaborative process, interagency co-ordination and trust. Local governments struggle with building capacity to plan, particularly in the areas of funding, technical expertise, incentives for participation, adequate time to conduct planning and questions regarding appropriate scale and scope of their planning efforts.

The nature and significance of these features can be better understood with the use of multibeam sonar systems that acquire high-resolution bathymetry and co-registered backscatter intensity data and reveal both the small-scale characteristics of RSDs and larger-scale seabed patterns associated with them. In this paper, we compare RSDs identified in high-frequency (300 kHz) multibeam sonar surveys on the inner shelves of southwest Washington, northern California and Long Island, New York. RSDs at these sites are evident as distinct features that are generally up to 1 m deeper than the adjacent seabed and exhibit high acoustic backscatter intensity due to the presence of coarse sediments, typically gravel. Shore parallel oscillatory ripples (typically 1 m wavelength) exist within the coarse material associated with RSDs and are attributed to wave-orbital motion. We propose a classification of RSDs based on their morphology and textural characteristics as well as the larger-scale seabed patterns associated with them, which together provide insight about the processes that affect their development and evolution. The RSDs described here are apparently the result of localized flow that can redistribute significant volumes of sediment in the nearshore zone under a range of energetic regimes over relatively short time scales. One type of linear shore-normal RSD always corresponds to larger-scale low-amplitude transverse bedforms that appear to be related to longshore currents. Some of these low- amplitude bedforms migrated as much as 50�150 m over 2 years. Another type of elongate RSD, appears to be relatively stable over time, is characterized by bathymetric and textural asymmetry with one distinct upcurrent edge and one diffuse downcurrent edge, and is apparently a result of transverse flow. Other irregularly shaped nearshore RSDs that can be created and destroyed on time scales of less than 1 year, are the result of localized erosion and accretion of up to 1 m, and are distributed rhythmically along-shore in water depths of 8� 16 m suggesting that they are related to hydrodynamics associated with the breaker zone. The characteristics of RSDs elucidated by high-frequency multibeam sonar data provide evidence of a variety of physical processes associated with RSDs and emphasize the importance of these features with respect to sediment transport on the inner shelf.","Ferrini, Vicki Lynn;Flood, Roger D.",NYSGI-R-05-005,NA,R/CCP-7,reprints (peer-reviewed),2005,NA,New York Sea Grant,A comparison of rippled scour depressions identified with multibeam sonar: evidence of sediment transport in inner shelf environments,"""Continental Shelf Research,"" 25:1979-1995, 2005.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using geographic information systems, the authors modified digital maps of surface geology and topsoils to produce proxy maps of potential dune sheet deposits in Oregon. The distributions of dune deposits were groundtruthed by extensive morphostratigra​phic profiling in the Oregon dune sheets. Dune sheet deposits were previously discriminated and mapped along the coasts of southwestern Washington, California, and Baja California. Representative morphostratigra​phic profiling was completed in this study for the previously published dune units of southwestern Wash- ington, northern and central California, San Miguel Island, and Baja California Sur. In this report the authors compile available radiocarbon dates (248 in number) from coastal dunes and associated archaeological sites in Oregon, northern California, and Baja California Sur. Subsurface profiles are presented from 646 dune sites that were observed in west-to- east transects across the mapped dune sheets. The profiled sites are georeferenced by UTM coordinates and include details on topsoil development, shallow subsurface lithology, paleosols, and groundwater diagenesis. Measured subsurface sections (2-30 m depth) include thickness of dune strata and different interbeds, including loess, peat, and diagenetic hardpans. These morphostratigra​phic profiles provide regional information on dune emplacement age, episodic dune sheet reactivation, and relative duration of dune sheet stabilization. Profile data from some sites address potential variation in geotechnical and hydrogeologic properties of the dune deposits.

If achieving the objectives of the Magnuson-​Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires managing people, a critical intervention point for improving management effectiveness is where the involvement of people is the greatest - the regional fishery management councils. The regional fishery management council system is under strain. Since the inception of federal fishery management in 1977, fisheries have undergone development and growth, stress and decline. Management problems have been caused by the race for fish, a short- term perspective, an over-investment in fishing capital and an under-​investment in the information base of management. Pressures for improving management performance are growing, evidenced in part by the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act and by the large number of lawsuits contesting federal management decisions (Botsford et al 1997; Restrepo et al. 1998; Ecosystems Principles Advisory Panel 1999; Heinz Center 2000; National Academy of Public Administration 2002.) In failing to address the race for fish, the problem of overcapacity, and the need to manage for long-term productivity, management through the regional council system has become increasingly complex and costly. Losses in biological and economic productivity have required more complicated regulations, expanded requirements for information, and created more conflicts among user groups. In turn, these factors have increased management costs while undermining management legitimacy and effectiveness (Hanna 1997; 1998). The Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) introduced much stricter standards for the protection of fish populations and their habitat. But the SFA did little to address the fundamental economic problems that continue to plague fisheries. Fishery management under the council system has been conducted, for the most part, in avoidance of the fundamental economic problems facing fisheries. Many fisheries are managed under regulations that still promote a race for fish, with incentives that are incompatible with long-term sustainability. Fisheries are almost universally overcapitalized​. Economic data and analysis are inadequate to the information required. Management costs are high. Each of these problems diminishes the effectiveness of management (Iudicello et al 1999; Heinz Center 2000.)","Hanna, Susan S.",ORESU-R-02-021,ORESU-R-02-021,R/RCF-05,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2002,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,Improving effectiveness of the regional fishery management councils,"""Proceedings of the Workshop on Improving Regional Ocean Governance in the United States,"" Biliana Cicin-Sain, et al, eds., pp. 97-100, Washington DC, December 9, 2002.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Increasing settlement of coastal margins is expanding the intensity and variety of human uses of coastal resources. The number of nonhuman claimants to coastal resources is also growing as protection of fur animal, marine bird and marine mammal populations is implemented. Problems facing coastal zones extend inland to watersheds through the important connection of estuaries. These coastal, estuarine and watershed problems are institutional, with biophysical and economic symptoms. This paper illustrates the role of historical paths and problems of redirection in institutions for coastal zone management. The focus is on salmon in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, which are both an integrating and polarizing presence throughout coastal zones and watersheds. Anadromous salmon traverse both watersheds and coastal zones in the course of their life histories as they migrate from rivers to oceans, and then back to freshwater natal streams to spawn. In ecological terms, they serve as the integrators of riverine and coastal ecosystems. The Columbia River Basin and the coastal ocean of Oregon and Washington provide excellent examples of the importance of historical development paths, the expanding connectivity between coastal zones and watershed, the increasing number of interests, and the contradiction between the present institutional environment and that needed to achieve coastal zone sustainability.","Hanna, Susan",ORESU-R-03-021,ORESU-R-03-021,A/RCF-10,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2003,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,Institutional evolution in coastal zones: historical paths and contemporary redirection,"""Proceedings of the Conference on Rights and Duties in the Coastal Zone: a Multidisciplina​ry Scientific Conference on Sustainable Coastal Zone Management,"" Stockholm, Sweden, June 12-14, 2003.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This invader was first discovered in San Francisco Bay almost a decade earlier and by 1995 it had spread to northern California. The coast-wide colonization event we studied in 1998 (El Nino cohort) was correlated with unusually strong north flowing coastal currents from September 1997 to April 1998. Larval transport by ocean currents from established populations to the south appeared to be the mechanism for the colonization. Crabs from the 1998-year class grew faster than counterparts from Maine and Europe, averaging 14mm in carapace width in June, and 46mm by September 1998. By the end of their second summer, males ranged from 52 to 80 mm in carapace width, and by fall of 2000 some males attained a carapace width of over 90 mm. The life span for C. maenas in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia is estimated to be similar as in Europe and Maine: 4-6 years. Even though the initial colonists (98- year class) are dying of senescence, and coastal currents have not been favorable for larval transport from source populations in California, green crabs do persist in Oregon and Washington estuaries.

Although both are common practices, few studies have examined the effects of carcass placement and the interaction of nutrient enrichment with physical habitat restoration in western Oregon.

We studied growth and condition of juvenile coho salmon in three streams with four experimental treatment reaches per stream 1) reference, 2) wood placement, 3) wood placement + salmon carcass addition, and 4) salmon carcass addition Growth rates of PIT tagged fish were greater in reaches that received salmon carcasses but with no large woody debris during this low flow year. Restoration with large woody debris increased the condition of juvenile coho prior to carcass additions, but results varied among streams. Salmon derived nutrient incorporation was determined by measuring a15N and a13C of juvenile coho salmon and aquatic macroinvertebra​tes. Results did not show strong evidence of salmon derived nutrient incorporation at any level of the food web. We also used the methods of Bilby et al.

Results indicated that incorporation of salmon derived nutrients increase as natural spawned salmon densities increased. Additionally we saw greater incorporation of salmon derived nutrients from natural spawners than from placed carcasses indicating a difference in their effects on ecosystem function.

Washington State currently uses fecal coliform concentration in growing water to determine the safety of consuming shellfish harvested from Puget Sound (PS). With the exception of some Vibrio testing, the level of viral or bacterial contamination in PS shellfish has never been studied. The reason for this is that current methods for testing shellfish tissues for viral and bacterial contamination are considered cumbersome and inefficient, a result of the tedious dissection and extraction procedures required for isolating the viruses from the digestive tissue of oysters, and the lack of a standardized protocol (including primer/probe sets) for Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR. In this study, two modifications were made to current methods to overcome the problems of labor intensive isolation procedures and the need for a high- speed centrifuge. The first was ultra-cold freezing of oyster tissue prior to dissection, and the second was direct RNA isolation from oyster lysate. Since shellfish tissue may contain high levels of PCR inhibitors, and because viruses and other pathogens collect in the digestive diverticulum (DD) of shellfish, recently described methods have relied on isolation of the digestive tissues prior to viral analysis in effort to reduce inhibition. Pre-freezing the intact oyster resulted in separation of the adductor muscles from the shell and made it significantly easier to remove oysters from their shells. More importantly, freezing allowed for easier location and dissection of the DD within the organism. Isolating RNA directly from the oyster lysate rather than relying on an adsorption/elut​ion technique increases the sensitivity of the assay. Chloroform extraction removed the majority of particulate matter from the oyster lysate, making near-constant reloading of the Qiagen RNeasy columns possible. Because the amount of virus in shellfish tissue is commonly small, being able to sample a larger volume is critical in order to capture the small amount of virus which may be present. To ensure wide breadth of detection, two sets of broadly reactive primers and Taqman probes were used in the real time RT-PCR assay to detect the viral RNA captured on the Qiagen columns. These modifications resulted in a method for detection of virus in oyster tissue that significantly reduced both personnel time required to complete the assay and time to detection of virus in the samples.","Duffield, Emily A.",WASHU-X-05-001,WSG-TH 06-01,R/A-83,theses/disserta​tions,2005,NA,Washington Sea Grant,A modified method for detection of viral and bacterial pathogens in Puget Sound oysters,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This analysis reveals an interweaving of coherent lateral exchange flows with discontinuous, small-scale dispersion as well as tidal residual currents that in some locations, sharpen rather than smooth gradients between water masses. Comparison between these Lagrangian results and an Eulerian salt flux decomposition suggests that along-channel complexity (channel junctions and channel curvature) is at least as important as cross-sectional depth variation in shaping the subtidal circulation. Finally, a nonconservative tracer method is used to produce high-​resolution, three- dimensional maps of residence time. This analysis shows that consistent with previous observational work in Willapa, at all except the highest winter-​storm-​level river flows, river- and ocean-​density-​driven exchanges are discernable but secondary to tidal stirring. In all seasons, despite the fact that half the volume of the bay enters and leaves with every tide, average retention times in the upper third of the estuary are 3�5 weeks.","Banas, N. S.;Hickey, B.

Seabirds aggregate in response to fishing operations and can become hooked and drown as they attack sinking baited hooks. Because many seabirds are long-lived with delayed maturity and limited reproductive capability, their populations are highly vulnerable to adult mortality. Even low levels of adult mortality can halt population growth or cause decline (Croxall et al. 1990; Weimerskirch et al. 1997). In the Alaska groundfish longline fisheries, incidental seabird mortality averaged 13,144 birds per year from 1993 to 2004, ranging from a high of 26,269 seabirds in 1998 to a low of 4,106 in 2002. Procellariiform seabirds (referred to as tubenose seabirds) � northern fulmars, albatrosses, and shearwaters� were, as a group, the most frequently caught (68.7%). Tubenose seabirds are the most oceanic of avian species, since most return to land only to breed or seek refuge from storms. The remaining takes included gull species (20%), unidentified seabirds (10.9%), and other seabird species (0.4%, including kittiwakes). Given the paucity of data on seabird distribution in Alaskan waters and the need to manage Alaska's longline fisheries based on the best available science, Washington Sea Grant Program (WSGP) developed a three-year collaborative program with the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), NMFS Alaska Fisheries Science Center Auke Bay Laboratory, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) to collect seabird data in the course of Pacific halibut and sableflsh (Anoplopomafimb​ria) stock assessment surveys on longline vessels. Preliminary data from 2002, the first year of seabird surveys, suggested that tubenoses were rare or absent in inside waters (Melvin et al. 2004). In this report, the authors provide the most current and comprehensive data on the distribution patterns of seabirds on the Alaskan longline fishing grounds and recommend regulatory changes based on analyses of this unique data set. In addition, the authors provide a characterizatio​n of the Alaska longline fishing fleet and quantify the number and size class of fishing vessels potentially affected by suggested regulatory changes.","Melvin, Edward F.;Wainstein, Michelle D.;Dietrich, Kimberly S.;Ames, Kelly L.;Geernaert, Tracee O.;Conquest, Loveday L.",WASHU-S-06-001,WSG-AS 06-01,A/FP-7,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2006,NA,Washington Sea Grant,The distribution of seabirds on the Alaskan longline fishing grounds: implications for seabird avoidance regulations,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Natural hazard mitigation planning is a relatively new activity in Washington State, and is responsible for designing strategies that reduce tsunami risk and vulnerability in Washington's coastal zone, which includes the shorelines of Puget Sound. The effectiveness of hazard mitigation is dependent upon three primary components - science, public policy, and the mitigation planning process - which are the foundation of tsunami hazard mitigation. This thesis examines these three components by reviewing the best available science and considering the role of science in tsunami hazard mitigation; evaluating existing federal, state, and local policies that influence tsunami hazard mitigation, and reviewing hazard mitigation plans that address tsunamis. This study shows that tsunamis are receiving little attention in hazard mitigation plans, and that the existing policy framework has not been effective in addressing tsunamis in Puget Sound. The findings of this research suggest that the dismissive treatment of the Puget Sound tsunami hazard results from the low salience of tsunamis on state and local political agendas, scientific uncertainty, and inefficiencies in the local planning process.","Bohlander, Andrew P.",WASHU-X-05-002,WSG-TH 06-02,R/CZ-22,theses/disserta​tions,2005,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"An assessment of tsunami hazard mitigation planning for Puget Sound, Washington",NA,NA,NA,Thesis abstract,NA,NA

The relative importance of these processes to biogeochemical cycling in highly reactive, permeable sediments remains poorly understood. We report results from several field experiments in a muddy-sand intertidal flat dominated by 2 functionally different types of bioturbating macrofauna in False Bay, Washington, USA: (1) the arenicolid polychaete Abarenicola pacifica and (2) 2 species of thalassinid shrimp (Upogebia pugettensis and Neotrypaea californiensis)​. Experimental plots composed primarily of one of the study taxa or mixed communities of both were evaluated for their effects on porewater advection, solute concentrations, and sediment characteristics​. Fluorescein-​impregnated acrylamide gels were used to infer rates of transport, and acrylamide gel peepers were used to record porewater concentrations of diagenetically important constituents among experimental plots. Laboratory studies evaluated rates of diffusive transport in non-bioturbated sediments for comparative analysis. We found that (1) functionally different macrofauna affect rates of porewater advection in permeable sediments, (2) organism effects are not attributable to changes in average measures of sediment granulometry, (3) species interactions may further complicate the advective environment and the resulting diagenetic processes, and (4) species effects vary according to reaction rate kinetics. We hypothesize that species-related effects on transport are due to inhibition of arenicolid feeding by thalassinid tubes that serve to block sediment fluidization and advective flow. Thus, specific behaviors and interactions among organisms appear to affect transport rates and sediment function in advectively permeable habitats. The results indicate the importance of integrating behavior, kinetics, and transport into future studies of sedimentary biodiversity and ecosystem function.","Waldbusser, George G.;Marinelli, Roberta L.",MDU-R-06-001,UM-​SG-​RS-​2006-​01,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),2006,NA,Maryland Sea Grant,"Macrofaunal modification of porewater advection: role of species function, species interaction, and kinetics","""Marine Ecology Progress Series,"" 311:217-231, 2006.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We measured salmon carcass nutrient contributions to riparian soils of Kennedy Creek, WA, a coastal rainforest system. We used ion exchange resins to estimate cumulative bioavailability of major ions in soils, arid soil extracts to examine timing and lateral movement of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3- from carcasses. Over the period of skeletonization (76 days), bioavailability of NH4+ was approx. 250x, soluble P(primarily PO4^-2) was approx. 2x, and sulfur (SOx) was approx. 5x higher than baseline within 20 cm of carcasses, while availability of other ions was not affected. Maximum NH4+ and NO3- within 10 cm of carcasses occurred at approx. 240 degree days (dd; 56 days). NO3- and NH4+ maxima 20 and 50 cm from carcasses occurred between 300 dd (70 days) and 600 dd (150 days). When protected from large scavengers, an average minimum of 49.3% of total carcass N was contributed to soils, and NH4+ and NO3- moved through soils laterally at least 50 cm. Approximately 97% of salmon N is in quickly decaying soft tissues, while 88% of Ca and 50% of P is in the slowly decaying skeleton.

Once the open reading frame transcription start site of the cDNA clone has been obtained, the promoter region is often of interest and is accessible by inverse PCR. Although inverse PCR is a standard technique, all PCR strategies do not necessarily result in success. The promoter of the pea gene HMG I/Y is of interest because of the possibility that its coded protein is influencing its own transcription. The HMG I/Y protein contains four AT-hooks (2,5) that have affinity for AT-rich regions of DNA (4). The extensive research relative to this property has led to the recognition that HMG-I/Y is an architectural transcription factor (7). It has recently been determined that both its RNA transcript and its protein product are depleted as the pea defense response is initiated (4). The pea HMG I/Y protein can efficiently bind to AT-rich segments of promoters' from pea PR genes, genes that are activated as the pea tissue resists fungal pathogens (1,4).

Growth of naturally contaminating bacteria in oysters during storage results in loss of quality and product value. Contamination of pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio parahaemolyticu​s and Vibrio vulnificus in oysters is also a safety concern. The traditional depuration process for reducing bacterial contamination in oysters using clean seawater has been reported to be ineffective in reducing Vibrio contamination in oysters.

However, extended exposure (>12 h) of oysters in EO water containing high levels of chlorine (>30 ppm) was found to be detrimental to oysters.

My primary goals were to derive a mechanistic understanding of the pathways and fate of salmon nutrients in riparian forests, and then, in light of the mechanistic work, to evaluate dendroecologica​l methods for reconstructing salmon abundance. A pilot study, Chapter I, provided initial evidence of positive relationships between salmon abundance and tree-ring growth. This prompted investigation of processes regulating availability of salmon nutrients to riparian trees. In Chapter II, I used a case study to examine the products and dynamics of salmon carcass decay. At least 49.3% of carcass N was contributed to soils, and the N moved laterally through soils at least 50 cm. The quick decay of soft tissues and slow decay of bones results in bioavailability of NH4+ within weeks, NO3- within months, and P and Ca+2 over months to years. In Chapter 111, I used a 15N tracer study to quantify the fate and movement of a late-season N pulse in a riparian plant-soil system. Western red cedar roots began to take up trace N almost immediately, and uptake continued throughout the winter. By spring, approx. 34% of the tracer N was found in trees, and tracer N was reallocated to aboveground pools. Most of the remaining tracer N was bound in soil organic matter, and - 79% of the tracer N was retained in the plots for one year. The mechanistic studies showed that riparian trees can acquire and use salmon-derived N within one year. In Chapter IV, I tested potential relationship between tree- ring 615N and salmon abundance. Interpretation of tree-ring 515N was fundamentally compromised by the presence of sap, and even when sap was removed, patterns in tree-ring 615N attributable to salmon were seen at only the coarsest scale. In Chapter V, I expanded the pilot study investigation to 9 additional systems. I identified relationships between tree-ring growth and salmon escapement at 5 sites, and used these relationships to reconstruct salmon abundance over 150-350 years. Tree-ring- based salmon abundance reconstructions presented here are novel.","Drake, Deanne Clare",WASHU-X-05-005,WSG-TH 06-05,R/F-152,theses/disserta​tions,2005,NA,Washington Sea Grant,The fate and influence of salmon nutrients in riparian soils and trees: seasonal to multi-century patterns (thesis abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, because they remain resistant to cultivation, very little is known about their physiology. Here we show that cold deep-seawater from the axial valley of Endeavour Segment on the Juan de Fuca Ridge contains not only groups I and II archaea as expected, but also unique potentially archaeal nitrogenase (nifH) genes, which are required for nitrogen fixation.

The introduction of NIS into coastal marine and estuarine waters comes from a variety of sources. Due to the large volumes and frequency of possible inoculations, ballast water is currently the most frequently cited method for the worldwide transference of NIS. Ballast water treatment by ozonation is one of the many treatment technologies being studied for implementation on board commercial vessels. Prior to any treatment system's application on board commercial vessels, all effects of a treatment must be defined. The objectives of the research were: (1) To better understand ozone and its residual products in seawater by performing bench-scale experiments to determine total residual oxidant (TRO) reductions over time. (2) Conduct ozone treatment experiments at the mesocosm level at the Marrowstone USGS Marine Field Station to determine a minimal TRO concentration for the removal of organisms at multiple trophic levels. (3) Using flow cytometry to develop a rapid biological analysis of ballast water that could be used for regulatory monitoring of the microbial population. Statistical comparison of the ozone dissolution rates, as measured by the increasing TRO over the ozonation period, is dependent on the source water. There was significant difference in the rate of TRO decay dependent on the salinity, when synthetic seawater was compared between two salinities, 15 and 30 PSU. The significant difference in the rate of TRO decay may not be due to the difference in salinity and/or the difference in TOC between the two salinity preparations. Analysis of synthetic seawater and Puget Sound seawater indicated that there was no significant difference between the initial TRO concentrations of 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mg/L Br2 and the rate of TRO decay over time. Each independent source water showed significant differences in the rate of TRO decay, indicating that with increasing TOC, there was an increase in the rate of TRO decay. Biological effects of ozone treatment in seawater were studied at the USGS Marrowstone Marine Station to observe the TRO concentrations necessary for the removal/reducti​on of bacteria, phytoplankton, and mesozooplankton to meet ballast treatment standards proposed by the State of Washington and the International Maritime Organization. A 4-log heterotrophic bacterial reduction was seen for initial TRO concentrations greater than 1.5 mg/L Br2. However, the bacterial abundances returned to control concentrations with time, dependent on the initial TRO level. Initial chlorophyll a abundance ranged from 22.0-0.37 ug/L and was reduced to an average of 0.05 ug/L, for initial TRO concentrations greater than 1.5 mg/L Br2. Analysis showed that there was a significant difference in live mesozooplankton abundance at 168 h between mesocosms having an initial TRO of 1.85 mg/L Br2 and those greater than 2 mg/L Br2, suggesting a larger abundance of live zooplankton with the initial TRO of 1.85 mg/L Br2. This experiment indicated that a mean initial TRO of 1.85 mg/L Br2 may be an insufficient oxidant concentration. The same analysis was also performed for the mesozooplankton Cirripedia nauplii, and similar results were found. Cirripedia nauplii were found to be one of the more abundant and hardiest mesozooplankton and these could be considered an indicator organism for future ballast water toxicity assays when examining the mesozooplankton trophic level within Puget Sound. Any ballast water treatment technology that is applied will require verification that the treatment was performed and the standards have been met. A rapid analysis of microbial levels and viability could be of great importance in the verification process. Plate counts of aquatic ecosystems have sometimes represented only 10% of the total microscopic counts. The use of flow cytometry for bacterial assessment of ballast water treatment is comparable to epifluorescent microscopy and has the additional benefits of faster analysis time, lack of human count bias, and the ability to discern fluorescent intensities. The results of this study indicated that both the high DNA (HDNA) and low DNA (LDNA) bacterial populations were significantly reduced when subjected to a TRO level of 1.6-1.9 mg/L Br2 (greater than 99% HDNA and 97% total bacterial removal). The reduced reduction in the LDNA population, compared to HDNA, suggested a slight difference in bacterial response to oxidation. This may be due to those cells being previously dead and unable to react to the oxidant or those cells being inactive spores which may also be more resistant to treatment.","Perrins, Jake Connelly",WASHU-X-04-005,WSG-TH-06-07,R/ES-55,theses/disserta​tions,2004,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Ozone treatment of ballast water for the reduction of non- indigenous aquatic organisms: laboratory and shipboard experiments (thesis abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ozone has many qualities that could lend an alternative to the ballast water treatment debate. The technology has been in use for drinking water disinfection for decades and would be effective in fresh and salt water. An ozone system was installed on an oil tanker to allow for full-scale study of the effectiveness of using ozone as a ballast water treatment. Additional smaller scale studies were done with an ozone generator in the lab on compounds and source waters from various regions. An important aspect to the acceptance of a ballast water treatment technology is the ability of verification by a neutral third party. Ozonation would have an effect upon the fluorescence of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to study the effects of ozonation on known compounds, natural source waters and ballast water were examined using fluorescence spectroscopy. Three- dimension excitation emission matrixes were created for different stages of ozonation to compare before and after ozonation spectra in the hopes that 3D-CD0M spectra would be quantitatively different. Based on the data gathered in this study it is doubtful that CDOM can be used to verify ballast water treatment due to variability of CDOM in water sources.","Young, Heather J.",WASHU-X-05-006,WSG-TH-06-08,R/ES-55,theses/disserta​tions,2005,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Effects of ozonation on chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM): implications for ballast water treatment protocol (thesis abstract),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies documenting some of these effects have shaped modern ecology. For example, concepts such as ""keystone species,"" in which carnivores at relatively low abundance structure natural communities by mediating competition (Paine 1966), and ""trophic cascades,"" in which predators regulate herbivores allowing edible plants to be limited only by resources (Paine 1980; Carpenter and Kitchell 1993), were both first observed and described in the marine realm. These examples were top-down (consumer-​dominated) effects driven by marine carnivores (Menge and Sutherland 1987; Scheffer et al. 2001; Steneck, this volume). These examples came from the marine real in part because shallow marine benthic ecosystems are accessible and scaled conveniently in space and time for ecological studies and also because documented predator impacts in these systems appear to be particularly strong (Schmitz et al. 2000; Shurin et al. 2002; Steneck, this volume). Oceans cover two-thirds of Earth, but most are nutrient-poor and populated with hyperdispersed and often highly migratory organisms that are difficult to study. Our review focuses on a subset of the marine realm: the coastal zones, shallow continental shelves where marine life concentrates at or near the seafloor. In this chapter we illustrate how widespread and globally important carnivores, particularly large carnivores, have been, and are, to the structure of marine ecosystems. We do not suggest that carnivores heavily influence all shallow benthic marine ecosystems, but they do influence many (or they have in the past) and thus should be considered for managing the biodiversity of those ecosystems.

During the early 1960's, these mortalities reached 35 to 50%, prompting an investigation coordinated by the National Marine Fisheries Service in California, Oregon, and Washington (Glude 1975; Katkansky et al. 1972; Scholz et al. 1968, 1971, 1973). The epidemiology of the mortality in the U.S. was similar in character to that described for Matsushima Bay (Imai et al. 1968; Kanno et al. 1965; Koganezawa 1975). High temperatures (18 deg C to 21 deg C) and elevated nutrient levels were associated with these mortalities. Beginning in 1972, the University of Washington College of Fisheries began a study of possible pathogenic organisms and their mode of infection by observing oysters in laboratory- simulated summertime conditions of elevated temperature and nutrient enrichment (Lipovsky and Chew 1972). Mortality was found to be associated with ^iirio-type bacteria. Later studies implicated Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio anguillarum as facultative pathogens (Grischkowsky and Liston 1974) . Since treatment of this disease by use of antibiotics is economically impractical, it was concluded that a logical approach to reducing mortality would be to determine if stocks of oysters could be genetically selected for improved survival during summertime stresses. This study was initiated with the following two objectives: 1) To determine whether resistance to the stress of elevated temperature is a genetically modifiable trait; accomplishment of this would be indicated by significantly greater survival of experimental crosses over imported Japanese stocks at elevated temperatures; 2) To assess the genetic variability within and among experimental crosses using electrophoretic analysis. This would shed light on the nature of inheritance in oysters and might help identify a marker associated with improved survival.","Beattie, J.

It demonstrates that the climate of the Pacific Northwest has fluctuated on a semi-regular basis, and shows that the recent decline in oyster condition has accompanied the current warm, dry portion of the climate cycle in the region. This correlation suggests that oyster condition may be controlled by climate, and that when the climate returns to cool, wet conditions, oyster condition should improve. If this correlation holds, there is cause for optimism that the oyster industry can look ahead to improved oyster condition in a few years. However, even if oyster condition were proven to be climate-driven, it is far from certain that the cool, wet conditions of the past will return on schedule or at all.

The OR signal as a function of processing time and sample temperature were collected and recorded using a computer data acquisition system. System has been tested during two different processes: sugar-protein interaction and, beer fermentation process. To study sugar-protein interaction, the following sugars were used: sorbitol, trehalose and sucrose, and in the place of Protein, Serum Albumin Bovine (BSA, A-7906 Sigma- Aldrich). In some food processes, different sugars are added to protect damage of proteins during their processing, storage and/or distribution. Different sugar/protein solutions were prepared and heated above critical temperature of protein denaturation. OR measurements were performed during heating process and effect of different sugars in protein denaturation was measured. Higher sensitivity of these measurements was found compared with Differential Scanning Calorimetry, which needs higher protein concentration to study these interactions. The brewing fermentation process was monitored in-situ using this OR system and validated by correlation with specific density measurements and gas chromatography. This instrument can be implemented to monitor fermentation on-line, thereby determining end of process and optimizing process conditions in an industrial setting. The high sensitivity of developed OR system has no mobile parts and is more flexible than commercial polarimeters providing the capability of implementation in harsh environments, signifying the potential of this method as an in-line technique for quality control in food processing and for experimentation with optically active solutions.","Mendoza-​Sanchez, Patricia;Lopez, Daniel;Kongraksawech, Teepakorn;Vazquez, Pedro;Torres, J.

Unexpectedly, mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that a second putative species of ghost shrimp frequently coexisted with N. californiensis in southern California intertidal habitats; almost all previous studies of soft-sediment communities in the region report the presence of N. californiensis only.

Rapid appearance of surface blooms is more consistent with the hypothesis that a dispersed cell population aggregates at the surface due to a combination of physical factors and swimming behavior. Because of the frequent association of Heterosigma bloom formation with a decrease in surface salinity, we hypothesize that a layer of low-salinity water over a high-salinity layer will suppress nearsurface vertical mixing and this halocline will enable up-swimming cells to rapidly aggregate at the surface. For this hypothesis to be viable, Heterosigma cells must be able to swim across salinity jumps of a sufficient magnitude to temporarily suppress vertical mixing. We tested whether this requirement is satisfied by using computerized video analysis to quantify swimming behavior and vertical distribution of Heterosigma within a vertical salinity structure. Swimming behavior is affected by the presence of a salinity jump and depends on the strength of the jump: cells stopped swimming upwards and aggregated below a fresh water interface; cells reduced upward swimming speed with a salinity jump from 28 to 8?, and upward swimming speed was unchanged in cells encountering a salinity jump from 28 to 16?. We used observed swimming behaviors to parameterize a model of a 2-layer stratified water column in which vertical mixing is suppressed at the halocline and modeled by eddy diffusivity within each layer. The model predicts rapid aggregation of cells to the surface layer.","Bearon, R. N.;Grunbaum, D.;Cattolico, R.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-wa-csv/6103612_1770_2818807.csv,14,"Bioconvection is a fascinating phenomenon of fluid mechanics that is driven by the swimming motion of micro-​organisms. Typically the velocity and spatial scale of the fluid motions are much larger than those associated with the swimming speed and size of an individual cell, resulting in rapid transport of cells and the formation of complex spatial patterns in cell concentration. Motile microalgae are ubiquitous in aquatic systems, and understanding how they are spatially distributed at a wide range of length and time scales is an important ecological task. In the natural environment, bioconvection is a little studied but potentially important mechanism influencing the vertical distribution, and therefore the growth and productivity, of motile microalgae at centimeter to meter scales. However, in order to make predictions about when and where bioconvection might occur, we need to understand how other physical factors, such as salinity stratification, will affect swimming behavior, fluid flow, and the resultant spatial distribution of cells. In this paper, we present laboratory experiments that demonstrate the importance of swimming in generating large scale, persistent spatial structure in stratified water. In the first experiment, cells in a weakly stratified fluid environment first aggregate at the surface, and then form a bioconvective plume that descends to the bottom of the tank over a distance of 20 cm, equivalent to 104 cell body lengths. In the second experiment, addition of a low-salinity surface layer enables cells, initially well mixed due to bioconvection, to form a dense surface aggregation. Motivated by these experiments, we present a linear stability analysis for the onset of bioconvection in a stable linear salinity gradient. The concentration of cells is modeled by a continuous distribution and swimming is modeled as a constant upwards component combined with a diffusive component. We consider a deep chamber, where at equilibrium cells are concentrated in a thin boundary region. The ratio of chamber depth to boundary region depth is d>>1. Using matched asymptotic analysis, we obtain the critical value of the cell Rayleigh number, Rcrit, for which the forcing due to a perturbation in cell concentration in the upper region drives flow. The effect of the salinity stratification depends on the salt Rayleigh number, Rs. If Rs1/6=o(d), the salinity gradient suppresses the vertical extent of the perturbation to the flow and salinity to a region of nondimensional depth O(Rs-1/6). The critical cell Rayleigh number is unaffected by the salinity gradient and is given at leading order by Rcrit=2d3delta, where delta is the ratio of horizontal to vertical cell self-diffusion. If Rs1/6=O(d), the salinity gradient confines perturbations in the flow and salinity to the thin boundary region, and Rcrit is specified as an algebraic function of Rs. The experiments are then discussed in light of the derived theory.","Bearon, R.

The analyses consider three alternative population modelling approaches: (1) modelling the entire population trajectory from 1848, using the 'backwards' method where the trajectory is back-calculated based on assigning a prior distribution to recent abundance; (2) modelling only the recent population trajectory, using the 'forwards from recent abundance' method, where the population is projected forwards from a recent year and the abundance in that year is not assumed to be at carrying capacity; and (3) a version of (2) that ignores density-​dependence. The 'backwards' method leads to more precise estimates of depletion level. In contrast, the 'forwards from recent abundance' method provides an alternative way of calculating catch-related quantities without having to assume that the catch record is known exactly from 1848 to the present, or having to assume that carrying capacity has not changed since 1848. Not only are all three models able to fit the abundance data well, but each is also able to remain consistent with available estimates of adult survival and age of sexual maturity. Sensitivity to the stage-​proportion data and the prior distributions for the life history parameters indicates that use of the 1985 stage-​proportion data has the greatest effect on the results, and that those data are less consistent with data on trends in abundance and age of sexual maturity. The analyses indicate that the population has approximately doubled in size since 1978, and the 'backwards' analyses suggest that the population may be approaching carrying capacity, although there is no obvious sign in the data that the population growth rate has slowed. Bayes factors are calculated to compare model fits to the data. However, there is no evidence for selecting one model over another, and furthermore, the models considered in this study result in different posterior distributions for quantities of interest to management. Posterior model probabilities are therefore calculated and used as weights to construct Bayesian model-averaged posterior distributions for outputs shared among models to take this ambiguity into account.

Temperature maximums and overall temperature exposure were greater at the Inner Bay site and may explain why mortality affected these oysters sooner than oysters planted at the Outer Bay site. Differences in cumulative mortality were significant among stocks (p < 0.0001), but not between sites (p> 0.05). OsHV prevalence was similar among stocks (p > 0.05) and between sites (p > 0.05).

Climate can affect ecosystem productivity and dynamics both from the bottom-up (through short- and long-term variability in primary and secondary production) as well as from the top-down (through variability in the abundance and spatial distribution of key predators). We have explored how the simplistic application of climate forcing through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms improves the fit of the model dynamics to observed population trends and reported catches for exploited components of the ecosystem. We find that using climate as either a bottom-up or a top-down forcing mechanism results in substantial improvements in model performance, such that much of the variability observed in single species models and dynamics can be replicated in a multi-species approach. Using multiple climate variables (both bottom-up and top-down) simultaneously did not provide significant improvement over a model with only one forcing. In general, results suggest that there do not appear to be strong trophic interactions among many of the longer-lived, slower-growing rockfish, roundfish and flatfish in this ecosystem, although strong interactions were observed in shrimp, salmon and small flatfish populations where high turnover and predation rates have been coupled with substantial changes in many predator populations over the last 40 years.","Field, J.

Dry-docking was completed in January 1993, and since that time the vessel has been part of the inactive fleet. In this 5-yr period, a dense growth of fouling organisms had developed on the outer surfaces of the hull. Out of concern that the fouled hull could become a source for the introduction of alien aquatic nuisance species to Hawaiian waters, an evaluation of the fouling community was conducted. In this study we found 116 taxa among 12 phyla in 10 samples scraped from the vessel's hull. Seventy-six species were identified: 11 known from Hawaiian waters, 17 with known temperate-​boreal distributions, and the remaining 48 known only from the Pacific Northwest. Forty percent of the taxa in this fouling community were not identified to species, so there remained some potential for alien species introduction. As a precaution to prevent accidental introductions, the ship was moved from Bremerton to the Columbia River in Oregon for a %day sojourn in freshwater before its transoceanic crossing to Pearl Harbor. Inspection of the vessel's hull upon arrival in Pearl Harbor revealed more than 90% of the hull to be completely clear of any fouling organisms. Only I1 species were found to be alive: 3 species probably recruited to the hull on the transoceanic crossing that may routinely arrive in Hawaiian waters, 4 species already present in Hawai'i, 3 Pacific Northwest species that appeared to be close to death on their arrival in Hawai'i, and 2 euryhaline amphipod species probably recruited to the hull while in the Columbia River. The amphipods were not reproductive and brooding young, suggesting that these species would not be successful colonists. A final inspection and sampling of the hull 83 days after arriving at Pearl Harbor failed to find live or dead Columbia River amphipods nor were the three Pacific Northwest species alive. Freshwater exposure for 9 days coupled with increased water temperatures during the journey to Hawai'i appear to be an extremely effective means of eliminating the temperate marine fouling community. This action substantially reduced the probability that an alien species would be introduced with the arrival of this historic vessel in Hawai'i.","Brock, Richard;Bailey-Brock, Julie H.;Goody, John",HAWAU-R-99-033,UNIHI-​SEAGRANT-​JC-​00-​35,A/AS-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),1999,NA,Hawaii Sea Grant,A case study of the efficacy of freshwater immersion in controlling the introduction of alien marine fouling communities: The USS Missouri,"""Pacific Science,"" 53(3):223-231, 1999.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because many seabirds are long-lived species with delayed maturity and limited reproductive capability, they are highly vulnerable to adult mortality. Building on earlier collaborative work to reduce the bycatch of seabirds in salmon drift gillnets, Washington Sea Grant Program launched a suite of research and outreach programs in collaboration with industry, NOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reduce seabird bycatch in Alaska’s diverse longline fisheries. More recently this work was extended to Alaska’s trawl fisheries. Outcomes: • Paired streamer lines were proven to be near 100-​percent effective at eliminating the catch of albatrosses and other surface-​feeding birds. • Both sablefish and cod fishing fleets adopted this new technology, two years before it was required — resulting in an eight-fold decrease in seabird mortality. • Antarctic seabird avoidance requirements were modified in 2003, based on findings from the Alaska research.","Melvin, Edward F.;Dietrich, Kim S.;Wainstein, Michelle D.",WASHU-G-05-005,NA,NA,"advisory/extens​ion reports; fact sheets, posters",2005,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Solving seabird bycatch in Alaskan fisheries: A case study of collaborative research,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Skeletal muscle concentrations of the steroid hormones testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) predicted similar, but slightly smaller sizes at maturity than morphological criteria. Stage of maturity for males was estimated identically using internal organs or external secondary sexual characters, thus allowing non-lethal maturity assessments. Peak parturition occurred from May through October, with increased concentrations of E2 and progesterone (P4) in skeletal muscle of females correlating with ovarian recrudescence during November through February. Extrapolation of the hypothesized 6 to 8 mo egg-laying season to observed mean parturition rates of captive specimens yielded an estimated annual fecundity of 19.5 to 28.9 egg cases. Differences in fecundity among higher taxonomic classifications of chondrichthyans were detected, with chimaeriform fishes more fecund than myliobatiform, squaliform, and rhinobatiform fishes. Delta-lognormal generalized linear models (GLMs) and cluster analysis indicated the presence of two distinct stocks of H. colliei on the U.S. West Coast. Abundance of the continental slope, and northern continental shelf and upper slope populations did not vary between 1977 and 1995, but increased from 1995 to 2006. Abundance trends in the southern shelf and upper slope region were not as straightforward​, with increasing abundance from 1977 to 1986, and lesser abundance thereafter, with the exception of an increase between 1992 and 1995. Although the life history, movement patterns, and aggregative behavior of H. colliei indicated that it may be vulnerable to population depletion by excess fisheries mortality, temporal abundance trends indicated that their population size has increased significantly within the last decade. The paradigm that all chondrichthyans are particularly susceptible to exploitation, therefore, may not apply to chimaeroids. The hypothesis that the dorsal-fin spine of H. colliei is a reliable structure for age estimation was tested by analyzing growth characteristics and imaging with polarized light microscopy and micro-computed tomography. Variation among individuals in the relationship between spine width and distance from the spine tip indicated the technique of transverse sectioning may impart imprecision and bias to age estimates. The number of growth band pairs observed by light microscopy in the inner dentine layer was not a good predictor of body size. Mineral density gradients, indicative of growth zones, were not observed in the H. colliei dorsal-fin spine, but were present in hard parts used for age determination of the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), roughtail skate (Bathyraja trachura), and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). The absence of mineral density gradients in the dorsal-fin spine of H. colliei decreases the likelihood that the bands observed by light microscopy represent a record of growth with consistent periodicity.","Barnett, Lewis A.K.",CASG-Y-08-001,NA,NA,theses/disserta​tions,2008,NA,California Sea Grant,"Life history, abundance, and distribution of the spotted ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Whereas informal estimates suggest a steep population increase at Tatoosh Island from similar to 1975 to 1990, more rigorous censuses from 1991-1999 indicate that the population has subsequently declined at a rate of similar to3% per year. The primary factor causing this decline appears to be increasing numbers of Bald Eagles, Haliaeetus leucocephalus, visiting the site, where eagles inflict both direct mortality due to eagle predation on adult murres and indirect mortality due to eagle facilitation of gull and crow predation on murre eggs. To explore the contribution of eagles to the observed population decline, we used age-specific vital rates drawn from the literature to develop a wide range of plausible models of murre demography. We found that the match between the projected and observed murre numbers is generally much improved by the inclusion of eagle effects. Our study highlights three general challenges to conservation and management practitioners, First, the difficulty of multispecies management may be exacerbated by successful restoration of high-​trophic-​level consumers, such as eagles, which may generate subsequent declines in their prey species. Second, indirect effects are usually subtle and often difficult to observe but, as in this case, may contribute substantially to the decline of focal species. Finally, when viewed in the context of the balance between local production and mortality, population trends are difficult to interpret without an explicit understanding of immigration/emi​gration rates and patterns.","Parrish, Julia K.;Marvier, Michelle;Paine, Robert T.",WASHU-R-01-027,WSG-TA 01-22,R/F-131,reprints (peer-reviewed),2001,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Direct and indirect effects: interactions between Bald Eagles and Common Murres,"""Ecological Applications,"" 11(6):1858-​1869, December 2001.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We quantified tag retention time and effects of attaching subcutaneous anchor radiotransmitte​rs on behavior, provisioning, and reproduction in the Common Murre (Uric aalge), a medium-bodied seabird. Between 1999 and 2001, we tagged 48 Common Murres on Tatoosh Island, Washington. Subsequently, 46 birds were detected during colony observation, radiotracking, or both. Activity budgets and time spent at the nest site did not differ between tagged birds and their untagged mates. However, tagged birds made fewer but longer trips away from the nest and provisioned their chicks significantly less than their mates did (0.07 +/- 0.02 fish h(-1) and 0.18 +/- 0.02 fish h(-1), respectively). Prey size and energy content did not differ. Despite the disparity in provisioning rates at the individual level, tagged pairs and control pairs had equivalent energy-delivery rates and reproductive success. Tagging effects did not persist in the long term, because percentage of tagged birds returning to the colony the next breeding season was similar to percentage of birds without tags, and tagged birds' reproductive success was comparable to that of the rest of the colony. Subcutaneous anchor attachments compared favorably to glued tags and implanted transmitters in terms of retention time and survival, respectively. We recommend using subcutaneous anchor transmitters for medium-bodied seabirds that employ flexible foraging strategies.

A 12-wk feeding trial was conducted to determine the effect of different levels of soybean meal (SM) and soy protein concentrate (SC) on the growth performance of juvenile Florida pompano. A control diet was formulated with dehulled solvent-​extracted soybean meal, low-antigen soy protein concentrate, wheat flour, corn gluten meal, and fishmea1, to contain 45% crude protein and 12% crude fat.

At each site, 96.5 to 99.4% of megalopae were captured by traps positioned within 1 m of the surface, and few were captured in traps with 1 m of the bottom (10 m depth). Megalopae abundance decreased with increasing distance from the mouth of Glacier Bay, with the highest abundance captured in Bartlett Cove, followed by the South Beardslee Islands, and very few megalopae were captured in the North Beardslee Islands. Transport processes were correlated with proxies for lunar cycle, tidal amplitude, maximum sustained wind speed and interactions among these effects. Few megalopae were captured at any site during 3/4 and full moon periods. High megalopae abundances in Bartlett Cove were associated with new to 1/2 moons and tidal amplitudes of 300 to 499 cm. Pulses of megalopae in the South Beardslee Islands occurred during new and 1/4 moons with tides of 500 to 599 cm and moderate winds.

In Southern California many recreational anglers favor live ghost shrimp as bait for marine fishes. This demand is met in part by importing live N. californiensis from Oregon and Washington, where they are considered pests. As with trade in most marine live baits in California, this market is effectively unregulated. We evaluated two potential risks associated with the transport of northern ghost shrimp into southern populations. First, we addressed the hypothesis that there are significant genetic differences between northern and southern populations; introduction of northern ghost shrimp into Southern California waters might tend to homogenize such genetic diversity. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing a fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene in seven ghost shrimp populations from sites spanning much of the species' range. Second, some imported ghost shrimp purchased at Southern California bait shops parasitized by brooding bopyrid isopods, Ione cornuta. These parasites tend to castrate their hosts, and some related species have major impacts on host population ecology. Surveys of natural populations, the holdings of west coast natural history museums, and the literature suggest that I. cornuta's southern range limit is Monterey Bay; thus use of northern ghost shrimp as live bait may result in release of non-native parasites into Southern California waters. Our results highlight risks associated with the common practice of transporting live marine bait across biogeographic boundaries.","Llaban, A. S.;Archie, J.

Further, many phenotypes are correlated and selection on one can affect evolution of the other. This challenge is especially important in fishes, because their evolutionary response to harvest, global warming and conservation actions are among the least understood aspects of their management. Here, we discuss two major genetic approaches to studying the evolution of complex traits, multivariate quantitative genetics and molecular genetics, and examine the increasing interaction between the two fields. These interactions include using pedigree-based methods to study the evolution of multivariate traits in natural populations, comparing neutral and quantitative measures of population structure, and examining the contribution that the two approaches have made to each other. We then explore the major role that quantitative genetics is playing in two key issues in the conservation and management of fish populations: the evolutionary effects of fishing and adaptation to climate change. Throughout, we emphasize that it is important to anticipate the availability of improvements in molecular technology and statistical analyses by creating research populations such as inbred lines and families segregating at fitness traits, developing approaches to measuring the full range of phenotypes related to fitness, and collecting biological material and ecological data in natural populations. These steps will facilitate studies of the evolution of complex traits over informative temporal and spatial scales.

These organisms display wide morphological diversity, ranging from minute unicells to massive, bladed forms. Surprisingly, chloroplast genome sequences are available only for diatoms, representing two (Coscinodiscoph​yceae and Bacillariophyce​ae) of approximately 18 classes of algae that comprise this taxonomic cluster. A universal challenge to chloroplast genome sequencing studies is the retrieval of highly purified DNA in quantities sufficient for analytical processing. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a simplified method for sequencing chloroplast genomes, using fosmids selected from a total cellular DNA library. The technique has been used to sequence chloroplast DNA of two Heterosigma akashiwo strains. This raphidophyte has served as a model system for studies of stramenopile chloroplast biogenesis and evolution. Results: H. akashiwo strain CCMP452 (West Atlantic) chloroplast DNA is 160,149 bp in size with a 21,822-bp inverted repeat, whereas NIES293 (West Pacific) chloroplast DNA is 159,370 bp in size and has an inverted repeat of 21,665 bp. The fosmid cloning technique reveals that both strains contain an isomeric chloroplast DNA population resulting from an inversion of their single copy domains. Both strains contain multiple small inverted and tandem repeats, non-randomly distributed within the genomes. Although both CCMP452 and NIES293 chloroplast DNAs contains 197 genes, multiple nucleotide polymorphisms are present in both coding and intergenic regions. Several protein-coding genes contain large, in-frame inserts relative to orthologous genes in other plastids. These inserts are maintained in mRNA products. Two genes of interest in H. akashiwo, not previously reported in any chloroplast genome, include tyrC, a tyrosine recombinase, which we hypothesize may be a result of a lateral gene transfer event, and an unidentified 456 amino acid protein, which we hypothesize serves as a G-​protein-​coupled receptor. The H. akashiwo chloroplast genomes share little synteny with other algal chloroplast genomes sequenced to date. Conclusion: The fosmid cloning technique eliminates chloroplast isolation, does not require chloroplast DNA purification, and reduces sequencing processing time. Application of this method has provided new insights into chloroplast genome architecture, gene content and evolution within the stramenopile cluster.","Cattolico, Rose Ann;Jacobs, Michael A.;Zhou, Yang;Chang, Jean;Duplessis, Melinda;Lybrand, Terry;McKay, John;Ong, Han Chuan;Sims, Elizabeth;Rocap, Gabrielle",WASHU-R-08-003,WSG-TA 08-04,R/B-48,reprints (peer-reviewed),2008,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Chloroplast genome sequencing analysis of Heterosigma akashiwo CCMP452 (West Atlantic) and NIES293 (West Pacific) strains,"""BMC Genomics,"" 9(211), May 8, 2008 [doi: 10.1186/1471-​2164-​9-​211].",10.1186/1471-​2164-​9-​211,NA,NA,NA,NA

In particular, genetic approaches have revolutionized our understanding in three areas: (i) most importantly, they have contributed to the discovery of extensive genetic population structure in many marine species, overturning the notion of large, essentially homogenous marine populations limiting local adaptation and speciation. (ii) Concomitant differences in ecologically important traits now indicate extensive adaptive differentiation and biocomplexity, potentially increasing the resilience to exploitation and disturbance. Evidence for rapid adaptive change in many populations underlies recent concerns about fisheries-​induced evolution affecting life-history traits. (iii) A compilation of recent published research shows estimated effective population sizes that are 2-6 orders of magnitude smaller than census sizes, suggesting more complex recruitment dynamics in marine species than previously assumed. Studies on Atlantic cod are used to illustrate these paradigm shifts. In our synthesis, we emphasize the implications of these discoveries for marine ecology and evolution as well as the management and conservation of exploited marine fish populations. An important implication of genetic structuring and the potential for adaptive divergence is that locally adapted populations are unlikely to be replaced through immigration, with potentially detrimental consequences for the resilience to environmental change - a key consideration for sustainable fisheries management.","Hauser, Lorenz;Carvalho, Gary R.",WASHU-R-08-005,WSG-TA 08-10,R/F-161,reprints (peer-reviewed),2008,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Paradigm shifts in marine fisheries genetics: ugly hypotheses slain by beautiful facts,"""Fish and Fisheries,"" 9:333-362, 2008.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Trials took place on two vessels targeting Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) over a five-month period in the Bering Sea, Alaska, USA. We used multiple criteria for evaluations - catch rates of all taxa, seabird abundance and attack rate, and gear sink rate and performance - making this study the largest and most comprehensive experiment of its kind. All mitigation technologies dramatically decreased seabird bycatch rates while having little to no effect on fish catch rates. Mitigation was more effective for surface foraging seabirds (Fulmarus glacialis and Larus spp.) than for diving seabirds (short-tailed shearwaters, Puffinus tenuirostris), reducing mortality rates by 91-100% and 80-97%, respectively. Based on multiple criteria, IWPS performed best, sinking gear within the protection of streamer lines eliminating surface forager catch completely and reducing shearwater catch by 97%, relative to the control. UWPS, status quo in the Alaska fishery, and IWalone performed similarly reducing surface forager catch rates by 98% and 91%, respectively, and shearwater rates by 87% and 80%, respectively. Seabird abundance and attack rate were poor proxies of seabird mortality, especially for IW gear. IW lines reduced the distance astern that birds have access to sinking baits by near half and its handling qualities proved superior to UW. We conclude that IW longlines and paired streamer lines are the core mitigation techniques and when deployed together, constitute the best management practice for seabird conservation in demersal longline fisheries using autoline systems.","Dietrich, Kimberly S.;Melvin, Edward F.;Conquest, Loveday",WASHU-R-08-002,WSG-TA 08-01,A/FP-6,reprints (peer-reviewed),2008,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Integrated weight longlines with paired streamer lines -- best practice to prevent seabird bycatch in demersal longline fisheries,"""Biological Conservation,"" 141:1793-1805, June 2008 [doi: 10.1016/j.bioco​n.2008.04.023].​",10.1016/j.bioco​n.2008.04.023,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, dispersal of juveniles of stream-rearing species, such as coho salmon O. kisutch, may also be an important component of colonization. Installation of fish passage structures on the Cedar River, Washington, and subsequent adult migration into the newly accessible habitat provided a rare opportunity to investigate colonization as coho salmon regained access to 33 km of habitat from which they had been excluded for more than a century. In this study, we describe the spatial distribution and growth patterns of the first two generations of juvenile coho salmon produced in the new habitat. Snorkel surveys in the Cedar River revealed patchy distributions of juvenile coho salmon that largely matched the distribution of adults spawning the previous fall, and higher densities occurred in lower reaches (i.e., those not far upstream from the dam). However, sequential surveys indicated that juveniles entered and moved upstream within a Cedar River tributary, Rock Creek, where few, if any, adults spawned. Juveniles captured in the Cedar River were similar in size to those in Rock Creek, but sizes differed between years and larger fish tended to occur farther upriver. We found no evidence for density-​dependent growth; there was no relationship between fish size and local density in either main-stem or tributary habitat. Abundance estimates suggest that relatively few juvenile coho salmon dispersed long distances into reaches neglected by spawning adults. We were unable to find any clear evidence that juvenile dispersal would increase the number of adults returning in the next generation, but such movements could accelerate the spatial expansion of the colonizing population in philopatric species like coho salmon.","Anderson, Joseph H.;Kiffney, Peter M.;Pess, George R.;Quinn, Thomas P.",WASHU-R-08-004,WSG-TA 08-09,R/F-159,reprints (peer-reviewed),2008,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Summer distribution and growth of juvenile Coho salmon during colonization of newly accessible habitat,"""Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,"" 137:772-781, April 2008 [doi: 10.1577/T07-​013.1].",10.1577/T07-​013.1,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, acidification of seawater caused by anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) threatens to reduce shellfish growth rates, thereby altering profit margins and reducing the resilience of the industry. At the same time, harvest closures caused by harmful algal blooms (HABs) are likely to increase with warming water temperatures, eutrophication, and changing ocean chemistry. I propose that if bivalve aquaculture in Puget Sound becomes unprofitable due to changes in seawater chemistry and regional warming, the value of shellfish could shift from an ecosystem good (marketable shellfish) to an ecosystem service (water filtration capacity). The history of shellfish in the Chesapeake Bay and recent research in shellfish biology offer insights into management strategies that could be applied in Puget Sound to enhance the resilience of the local aquaculture industry. Strategic management decisions may help to guide the transformation of the aquaculture industry, prolonging its economic profitability in the face of exogenous forces such as changing ocean chemistry and a warming climate.","Feifel, Kirsten M.",WASHU-Y-09-003,WSG-TH 09-03,E/MS-9,theses/disserta​tions,2009,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Shifting ecosystem services: a case study of the Puget Sound aquaculture industry,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here I seek to explore the impacts of prolonged and intensified seasonal hypoxia on the structure of resident food webs to evaluate ecological responses to hypoxia in Hood Canal and explore the application of ecosystem-based management (EBM) tactics for mitigating the problem of hypoxia in the region. I use a quantitative modeling approach to construct mass-balanced food web models, enabling the exploration of system -- level metrics that cannot be identified with a species or community-level approach. Specifically, I developed four mass-balanced food web (Ecopath) models to evaluate differences in food web structures between a site that experiences regular seasonal hypoxia and one that does not. I also compared seasonal shifts via analysis of food web structures prior to the onset of regular seasonal hypoxia and during seasonal hypoxia. The food web structures at Hoodsport, which regularly experiences seasonal hypoxia, were characterized by reduced biomass, production, and absolute flow at all trophic levels compared with the food web structures at Hazel Point, which does not regularly experience seasonal hypoxia. These differences were magnified with the onset of seasonal hypoxia. Differences between time periods at Hoodsport reflects the hypoxia, seasonal, and other unidentified impacts, whereas the differences at Hazel Point reflect seasonal and unidentified impacts absent of hypoxia. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is an integrated approach that considers entire ecosystems, including humans, the interactions among ecosystem components, and the cumulative impacts of multiple activities (McLeod et al. 2005, Leslie & McLeod 2007, Levin & Lubchenco 2008). EBM can be applied to the management of stressed or disturbed marine ecosystems. Here I used the stressed ecosystem of Hood Canal as an example of the application of the four principles for marine EBM at the regional scale. I demonstrated the four key principles of EBM (Leslie & McLeod 2007) at work to address the hypoxia problem in Hood Canal. I identified the way in which each principle is currently addressed. I summarized exemplary actions of the Hood Canal Dissolved Oxygen Program (HCDOP) and its partners relating to each principle. Finally, I argue that the EBM approach used to address hypoxia in Hood Canal can be used as a model for managing other marine ecosystems under stress.","Correa, Lindsay E.",WASHU-Y-09-001,WSG-TH 09-01,E/MS-9,theses/disserta​tions,2009,NA,Washington Sea Grant,An evaluation of ecological responses to hypoxia in Hood Canal and an example of regional marine ecosystem-based management in practice,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Significant efforts have been made to remove or provide passage around these barriers; however, our understanding of the ecological effects of these efforts is minimal. Installation of a fish passage facility at the Landsburg Dam, WA, USA provided migratory fish access to habitat from which they had been excluded for over 100 years. Relying on voluntary recruitment, we examined the effectiveness of this facility in restoring coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon populations above the diversion, and whether reintroduction of native anadromous species affected the distribution and abundance of resident trout (O. mykiss and O. clarki). Before the ladder, late summer total salmonid (trout only) density increased with distance from the dam. This pattern was reversed after the ladder was opened, as total salmonid density (salmon + trout) approximately doubled in the three reaches closest to the dam. These changes were primarily due to the addition of coho, but small trout density also increased in lower reaches and decreased in upper reaches. A nearby source population, dispersal by adults and juveniles, low density of resident trout and high quality habitat above the barrier likely promoted rapid colonization of targeted species. Our results suggest that barrier removal creates an opportunity for migratory species to re-establish populations leading to range expansion and potentially to increased population size.","Kiffney, Peter M.;Pess, George R.;Anderson, Joseph H.;Faulds, P.;Burton, K.;Riley, Stephen C.",WASHU-R-09-007,WSG-TA 08-13,R/F-159,reprints (peer-reviewed),2009,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Changes in fish communities following recolonization of the Cedar River, WA, USA by Pacific salmon after 103 years of local extirpation","""River Research and Applications,"" 25:438-452, June 12, 2008 [doi: 10.1002/rra.117​4].",10.1002/rra.117​4,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recovery has been slow, and one potentially limiting factor is the effect of nonindigenous species, in particular predation by the Japanese oyster drill (Ocinebrina inornata). Japanese drills historically caused significant economic losses to Olympia oyster aquaculture, but their impact on recent restoration efforts remains largely unknown. If drills have a saturating (e.g., Type I or II) functional response, they could keep local oyster populations suppressed at low levels. However, the magnitude of drill impacts may depend on the availability of alternative prey species, such as barnacles and nonindigenous bivalves. To test these hypotheses, we measured drill predation rates by transplanting Olympia oysters into several sites in Puget Sound. At some sites, drills were responsible for a large fraction (up to 100%) of total oyster mortalities over a three- to four-month period, but predation pressure was highly variable within and among sites and was only weakly related to drill density. The per capita interaction strength of drills diminished with increasing density of naturally occurring Olympia oysters, indicating that drill feeding rates saturate when prey are abundant. In addition, there was an indirect effect of alternative prey: drill per capita interaction strength was negatively related to densities of barnacles (Balanus spp.) and Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas). We performed enclosure experiments manipulating drill, Olympia oyster, and barnacle (Balanus glandula) densities to directly estimate the shape and parameters of the drill functional response. The data strongly support a saturating, but not sigmoid (Type III) response, consistent with the oyster transplant study. These results suggest that controlling Japanese drills would benefit Olympia oyster recovery or restoration efforts in some areas; however, drill eradication is notoriously difficult and labor-​intensive. Native oyster restoration may be possible even in the presence of drills if local abundance and recruitment are sufficient to saturate drill feeding rates, or if alternative prey are available.","Buhle, Eric R.;Ruesink, Jennifer L.",WASHU-WR-06-001,WSG-WO 08-01,R/ES-62,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2007,NOAA Restoration Center,Washington Sea Grant,Impacts of invasive drills on Olympia oysters in Puget Sound: implications for restoration,"""West Coast Native Oyster Restoration,"" 2006 workshop proceedings, pp. 31, Silver Spring, Maryland, September 6-8, 2006.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In Liberty Bay, the Puget Sound Restoration Fund and The Nature Conservancy are working to facilitate the recruitment of Olympia oysters by adding Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) cultch in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Previous research suggests the presence of Japanese oyster drills in Liberty Bay may pose a significant threat to the restoration of the Olympia oyster population. We are conducting research to test the feasibility of reducing drill densities and to quantify the benefits of drill control for Olympia oysters in the context of this restoration project. We are using a controlled, replicated experiment to compare the cost-​effectiveness of two control methods: (1) visual search and removal of drills from the substrate, and (2) the use of bait (barnacle-​encrusted stakes) to concentrate drills for removal. The experiment is replicated in a pre-existing habitat patch and a recent shell addition area, allowing us to ask whether the costs and benefits of drill control differ for established and colonizing oyster populations. Our results will help to inform the allocation of resources for predator control in native oyster rebuilding efforts. Our preliminary results indicate that there is no significant difference in mean drill density between the control, removal from substrate and removal from bait plots. We predicted that this is due to the small relative scale of the removal and the scale and intensity of the removal would need to be increased to have a significant impact on drill density. We tested these predictions by conducting a drill dispersal experiment to help understand drill movement in the experimental areas in Liberty Bay. Drills were collected, marked and released from a central point. We returned two weeks later to record movement and found that drills traveled meters from the release point. This supports the idea that drill movement is significant and explains why small scale removal may be ineffective. Preliminary conclusions indicate that in addition to increasing prey population (O. Conchaphila), predator density (O. inornata) should be reduced although this proves to be challenging.","Henson, Kate;Buhle, Eric",WASHU-WR-07-001,WSG-WO 08-02,R/ES-62,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2008,NOAA Restoration Center,Washington Sea Grant,"Control strategies for Japanese oyster drill and implications for restoration and management of Olympia oyster (Ostrea conchaphila) in Liberty Bay, Washington","""West Coast Native Oyster Restoration,"" 2007 workshop proceedings, pp. 42, Shelton, Washington, August 13-15, 2007.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of the project was to establish protocols to monitor seabird behavior in response to tori lines (also called streamer lines), and to begin to establish essential design elements for effective tori lines. This project was a collaboration of the New Zealand Japan Tuna Company, Ltd, the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries, and Washington Sea Grant. Ed Melvin was the scientist aboard and made observations reported here. Pelagic fisheries managed by international agreements (Regional Fishery Management Organizations or RFMOs) constitute one of the greatest conservation threats to Southern and Pacific Ocean seabirds. Although tori lines are the most widely prescribed seabird mitigation tool in longline fisheries, controlled studies demonstrating their effectiveness in pelagic fisheries in the context of production fishing have not been undertaken. Unlike demersal fisheries where all fishing gear sinks below the surface within 50 m of the stern, pelagic longlines are suspended between floats at the surface. This surface fishing gear makes tori lines more challenging to use in pelagic fisheries. Often fishers deploy tori lines to the leeward side of the gear where they are least effective, or do not deploy them at all for fear of hanging up on buoys at the surface jeopardizing the fishing operation. Further, the design and materials of tori lines have not been optimized via research for either demersal or pelagic longline fisheries. In 2007 the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Scientific Committee debated the efficacy of different tori line designs used by various longline nations. The underlying science on competing designs was found lacking, frustrating progress toward required seabird mitigation in the fishery. The USA, Australia and New Zealand expressed keen interest in coordinating a series of trials to test various tori line designs in 2008. This project was the initial critical step in the process of determining the optimal design of tori lines for pelagic longline fisheries. Establishing protocols to monitor seabird behavior in response to tori lines will enable subsequent definitive comparison of tori line designs.

We used a spatial model with two life stages (larvae and adults) to evaluate the effects of larval dispersal distance for fisheries managed by a total allowable catch (TAC) and an NTMR. We examined effects of the timing of density-​dependent mortality in relation to larval movement. Abundance reached similar values for populations with long and short larval dispersal distances. Catch declined substantially for stocks with short larval dispersal distances. When larval dispersal distances were long, catch declined to values below maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but stabilized. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined to 9% of CPUE at MSY for stocks with short distance larval dispersal after the implementation of an NTMR; with long distance larval dispersal, CPUE declined to approximately 50% or less of the CPUE at MSY.

The weights typically used are collections of rocks enclosed in netting bags.

This problem can be solved by use of hydrodynamicall​y shaped (e.g. torpedo-shaped) steel weights, which are smaller for equivalent weight, and require no maintenance. An experiment was conducted on a Spanish-system longline vessel to determine the relationship between the sink rates of longlines equipped with bags of rocks (4, 6 and 8 kg) and those with steel weights of equivalent masses.

We know already that closing fisheries in specific areas may lead to more fish, larger fish and a more diverse community. There are also reports that such benefits 'spill over' to adjacent areas, mainly by emigration of adult fish, thus benefitting fisheries and biodiversity in general. What we absolutely don't know is the effect of MPAs on the production of new fish (called 'recruitment'), especially how far fish in a specific MPA would spread their offspring and if they have any chance to reach the next MPA. Most species of marine fish and invertebrates have a pelagic phase, when larvae float in the water column and are potentially carried away by ocean currents. These larvae are tiny, and so what we usually observe is that they hatch and, several weeks or months later, juveniles appear.

In Alaska, annual seabird bycatch in demersal longline fisheries ranged between 10,300 and 26,300 birds (1995-2001). We explore the relationship between four categories of potential forcing factors (temporal, spatial, environmental, and fisheries-​related) and seabird bycatch rates in Alaska demersal longline fisheries to provide practical management alternatives that could significantly reduce seabird bycatch. Separate generalized linear or additive models (GLM or GAM, respectively) were created for several combinations of seabird group, fishery and large geographic region. Across nearly all models, ""vessel"" was the most influential factor explaining seabird bycatch rate variation. Rather than a single variable, vessel is an amalgam of unmeasured forcing factors many of which could not be separated out in this data set (e.g., longline sink rate, vessel setting speed, line deployment location relative to propeller direction). A separate vessel-specific analysis also supported the multivariate results that performance of an individual vessel is overwhelmingly important (i.e., some vessels have consistently high or low bycatch rates from year to year). Therefore, vessel-specific performance is a critical management option. The effects of temporal (annual, month, and breeding phenology) and spatial variables were also moderately influential on seabird bycatch rates. Our results suggest that seasonal adjustments in the Alaska longline fishery have potential for overall bycatch reductions, but vague seabird management objectives could have huge unintended and undesirable consequences when implementing temporal adjustments. Other variables (environmental and other fishing-related factors) were frequently significant but contributed a small amount to overall explained deviance.

We investigated the potential role of two introduced predatory gastropods, the Japanese drill (Ocinebrina inornata) and the eastern drill (Urosalpinx cinerea), in limiting Olympia oyster recovery. We quantified the bay-wide distribution, local abundance, and per capita effects of drills, and asked how each of these three components of total invasion impact might be influenced by another dominant introduced species, the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Bay-wide sampling revealed differences in spatial distribution of the two drill species, with U. cinerea more abundant toward the head of the estuary and O. inornata more abundant toward the mouth. Individual feeding trials indicated that both drill species preferred Pacific oysters to Olympia oysters of similar size, and preferentially attacked smaller oysters. We used field enclosures to quantify the direct effects of Japanese drill predation on Olympia and Pacific oysters, intra and interspecific competition, and indirect effects mediated by the shared predator. Predation reduced the survival of both oyster species, but the per capita impact of Japanese drills declined with increasing density of either Olympia or Pacific oysters, consistent with a type II functional response. This positive indirect effect of Pacific oysters on Olympia oysters was offset by asymmetric competition, in which Pacific oysters reduced Olympia oyster growth and survival but not vice versa. Despite the large drill impacts seen in these experiments, Olympia oysters transplanted to intertidal sites throughout the bay experienced low and variable rates of drill predation compared with other mortality sources. Introduced drills may be only one of a suite of factors that prevent rebuilding of Olympia oysters in the intertidal zone in Willapa Bay.","Buhle, Eric R.;Ruesink, Jennifer L.",WASHU-R-09-009,WSG-TA 09-07,R/ES-62,reprints (peer-reviewed),2009,National Shellfisheries Association,Washington Sea Grant,"Impacts of invasive oyster drills on Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida Carpenter) recovery in Willapa Bay, Washington, USA","""Journal of Shellfish Research,"" 28(1):87-96, December 2009 [doi: 10.2983/035.028​.0115].",10.2983/035.028​.0115,NA,NA,NA,NA

We monitored recruitment every 2 wk between May and September 2004 and found a small recruitment peak in late July, which was much later than reported for these oysters when they were abundant throughout Puget Sound. We also experimentally tested two factors that could influence recovery: tidal elevation and substrate type. We established 1 m2 plots at three tidal elevations (-0.3, 0, +0.3 m MLLW) with six substrates: bare, gravel, crushed shell of Crassostrea gigas (Pacific oyster), whole C. gigas shell, whole shell of O. lurida, and live O. lurida. The plots were set up May 21, 2004 and measured for recruitment on October 16, 2004 and April 11, 2005 by collecting material from a 0.0125-m2 area of each plot. Recruitment improved at low tidal elevations and differed across substrates. Ostrea lurida shell consistently provided a better recruitment substrate than gravel or bare plots, but shell treatments could not be distinguished statistically. Postrecruitment mortality occurred in all treatments; however the rates of mortality were not significantly different by elevation or substrate treatment. Habitat restoration (low intertidal and subtidal shell areas) should promote the recovery of O. lurida where natural recruitment still occurs.","White, Jacqueline M.;Buhle, Eric R.;Ruesink, Jennifer L.;Trimble, Alan C.",WASHU-R-09-010,WSG-TA 09-06,R/ES-62,reprints (peer-reviewed),2009,National Shellfisheries Association,Washington Sea Grant,"Evaluation of Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida Carpenter 1864) status and restoration techniques in Puget Sound, Washington, United States","""Journal of Shellfish Research,"" 28(1):107-112, March 2009 [doi: 10.2983/035.028​.0101].",10.2983/035.028​.0101,NA,NA,NA,NA

We found that both recruitment and community development rates were inversely correlated with diversity, with the highest rates seen in temperate latitudes and the lowest in tropical Belize. Seasonal variability in recruitment also varied latitudinally, with strong summer pulses of recruitment in northern latitudes shifting to low and year-round recruitment at low latitudes. However, species turnover through time in communities becoming established was highest in Belize.

Histograms of the hourly-measured SWHs more fully document this shift toward higher values over the decades, demonstrating that both the relatively low waves of the summer and the highest SWHs generated by winter storms have increased. Wave heights associated with higher percentiles in the SWH cumulative distribution function are shown to be increasing at progressively faster rates than those associated with lower percentiles. This property is demonstrated to be a direct result of the probability distributions for annual wave climates having lognormal- or Weibull-like forms in that a moderate increase in the mean SWH produces significantly greater increases in the tail of the distribution. Both the linear regressions of increasing annual averages and the evolving probability distribution of the SWH climate, demonstrating the non-​stationarity of the Pacific Northwest wave climate, translate into substantial increases in extreme value projections, important in coastal engineering design and in quantifying coastal hazards. Buoy data have been analyzed to assess this response in the wave climate by employing various time-dependent extreme value models that directly compute the progressive increases in the 25- to 100-year projections. The results depend somewhat on the assumptions made in the statistical procedures, on the numbers of storm-generated SWHs included, and on the threshold value for inclusion in the analyses, but the results are consistent with the linear regressions of annual averages and the observed shifts in the histograms.","Ruggiero, Peter;Komar, Paul D.;Allan, Jonathan C.",ORESU-R-10-003,ORESU-R-10-003,R/CNH-16,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,Increasing wave heights and extreme value projections: the wave climate of the U.S. Pacific Northwest,"""Coastal Engineering,"" 57:539-552, 2010 [doi: 10.1016/j.coast​aleng.2009.12.0​05].",10.1016/j.coast​aleng.2009.12.0​05,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, a QTL analysis using an outbred cross was initiated to determine the molecular basis of phenotypic correlations between such growth traits in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), an important fish species distributed located on seven linkage groups (OKI03, OKI06, OKI18, OKI19, OKI23, OKI24 and an unnamed linkage group) or associated with five unlinked markers (Omm1159, Omm1367/i, Omy325UoG, OmyRGT55TUF and OtsG422UCD). One QTL for hatch timing was associated with the marker, Omm1241. All QTL were of minor effect, explaining no more than 20% of the observed variation in phenotypic value. Several instances of colocalization of QTL weight, length and growth rate were observed, suggesting a genetic basis for phenotypic correlations observed between these traits. This study lays the foundation for future QTL mapping efforts, for detailed examinations of the genetic basis of phenotypic correlations between growth traits, and for exploring the adaptive significance of growth traits in natural populations.","McClelland, E.

We examined the recent (2001-2007) dietary habits of Puget Sound, Washington, Chinook salmon (listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act) during their first marine growing season (April-​September). Juvenile Chinook salmon initially fed in nearshore marine habitats and then shifted to feed primarily offshore during July-September. Diet composition varied significantly among sampling regions (northern, central, and southern), habitats (nearshore, offshore), years, months, and fish size-classes. At nearshore sites, insects (all months) and gammarid amphipods (July) were dominant prey sources, whereas in offshore diets decapods (primarily crab larvae; July) and fish (September) were most important. Chinook salmon became increasingly piscivorous as they grew and ate fish with fork lengths up to 51% (nearshore) and 52% (offshore) of predator fork length. At nearshore sites, Chinook salmon fed mainly on larval and juvenile Pacific sand lances Ammodytes hexapterus; offshore, they primarily ate juvenile and older Pacific herring Clupea pallasii. Overall, Chinook salmon had more diverse diets and ate higher-quality prey (insects) in northern nearshore and central offshore waters, whereas Chinook salmon caught in the southern nearshore and northern offshore waters had a lower proportion of empty stomachs but ate lower-quality prey (crustaceans). Annual variation in the composition of offshore prey appeared to be determined early in the growing season, suggesting that environmental factors (e.g., climate) affecting marine productivity might produce strong interannual trends in marine survival of Puget Sound Chinook salmon. In addition, the importance of insects as high-quality prey highlighted the terrestrial link to the marine feeding of Chinook salmon and suggests that shoreline development and land use changes will affect feeding opportunities for these fish in Puget Sound.","Duffy, Elisabeth J.;Beauchamp, David A.;Sweeting, Ruston M.;Beamish, Richard J.;Brennan, James S.",WASHU-R-10-003,WSG-TA 10-04,A/FP-7,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Ontogenic diet shifts of juvenile Chinook salmon in nearshore and offshore habitats of Puget Sound,"""Transactions of American Fisheries Society,"" 139:803-823, 2010 [doi: 10.1577/T08- 244.1].",10.1577/T08-​244.1,NA,NA,NA,NA

In Alaska, annual seabird bycatch in demersal longline fisheries ranged between 10,300 and 26,300 birds (1995-2001). We explore the relationship between four categories of potential forcing factors (temporal, spatial, environmental, and fisheries-​related) and seabird bycatch rates in Alaska demersal longline fisheries to pro- vide practical management alternatives that could significantly reduce seabird bycatch. Separate generalized linear or additive models (GLM or GAM, respectively) were created for several combinations of seabird group, fishery and large geographic region. Across nearly all models, ""vessel"" was the most influential factor explaining seabird bycatch rate variation. Rather than a single variable, vessel is an amalgam of unmeasured forcing factors many of which could not be separated out in this data set (e.g., longline sink rate, vessel setting speed, line deployment location relative to propeller direction). A separate vessel-specific analysis also supported the multivariate results that performance of an individual vessel is overwhelmingly important (i.e., some vessels have consistently high or low bycatch rates from year to year). Therefore, vessel-specific performance is a critical management option. The effects of temporal (annual, month, and breeding phenology) and spatial variables were also moderately inﬂuenti​al on seabird bycatch rates. Our results suggest that seasonal adjustments in the Alaska longline fishery have potential for overall bycatch reductions, but vague seabird management objectives could have huge unintended and undesirable consequences when implementing temporal adjustments. Other variables (environmental and other fishing-related factors) were frequently significant but contributed a small amount to overall explained deviance. Based on this study, we conclude that a vessel-specific management approach would be the most effective and efficient means to reduce seabird bycatch in Alaska.","Dietrich, Kimberly S.;Parrish, Julia K.;Melvin, Edward F.",WASHU-R-09-013,WSG-TA 09-09,A/FP-7,reprints (peer-reviewed),2009,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Understanding and addressing seabird bycatch in Alaska demersal longline fisheries,"""Biological Conservation,"" 142:2642-2656, 2009 [doi: 10.1016/j.bioco​n.2009.6.013].",10.1016/j.bioco​n.2009.6.013,NA,NA,NA,NA

If enacted, the proposal will provide $3 million annually over a 3-year period beginning in fiscal year 2000. Adoption of JSA's draft National Aquaculture Development Plan could serve as a vehicle for promoting needed change in the legal and regulatory framework for offshore aquaculture and devising a federal policy for leasing federal waters in the EEZ.","Rieser, Alison;Bunsick, Susan",NHU-WR-99-001,UNHMP-​PR-​SG-​99-​29,A/P-16,reprints (not peer-reviewed),1999,NA,New Hampshire Sea Grant,Offshore marine aquaculture in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ): legal and regulatory concerns,"""Trends and Future Challenges For U.S. National Ocean and Coastal Policy,"" Proceedings of a Workshop, Biliana Cicin-Sain, Robert W.

Rural areas experiencing declines in natural resource-based economies are looking to tourism as a development opportunity. One such area is Newfoundland, Canada, where a moratorium on cod fishing that affected all aspects of society gave rise to a modern tourism industry. The period following the moratorium offers a finite timeframe for analyzing the success of tourism development in a rural, coastal location devastated by the loss of a natural resource. This report documents the results of research conducted in 2008 to evaluate the impact of the 1992 cod moratorium on Newfoundland's rural coastal villages (""outports""), and the role of tourism in community revitalization efforts. Newfoundland and Maine have a common history of European settlement based on marine resource exploitation in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. Newfoundland's experience developing tourism in the face of significant economic and social changes can inform tourism development in coastal Maine, where reliance on a single fishery (lobster) mirrors Newfoundland's pre-​cod-​collapse economy and culture.

This tissue becomes susceptible to the true pathogen, F. solani f. sp. pisi, within 18 h. Previous research indicated that there is an early effect by both pathogens on pea chromatin possibly via the architectural transcription factor, HMG A. HMG A binds with AT-rich regions of the pea DRR206 gene (a PR gene) promoter. The total PR gene-based defense response is activated by three eliciting agents, Fsph DNase, chitosan oligomers and inhibitors of phosphatase such as calyculin A. This report monitors the presence of HMG A and histone and their phosphorylation and ubiquitination, both within the total cytoplasm and in association with isolated chromatin. Inoculation results in a diminution of both HMG A and histones H2A/H2B within 5 h, being more extensive in the susceptible interaction. The detectable phosphorylated HMG A and some accompanying nuclear proteins are diminished within 4 h after pathogen challenge. Changes in the molecular weight of the nuclear components were ELISA-monitored with anti-HMG A, anti-histone H2A/H2B and anti-ubiquitin antisera and indicated that some fungal-caused global changes in chromatin occur via ubiquitin complexing. These modifications of the pea's nuclear proteins could have major transcriptional-​related roles in disease resistance since they are temporally associated with the onset of PR gene activation.","Isaac, Jared;Hartney, Sierra L.;Druffel, Keri;Hadwiger, Lee A.",WASHU-R-09-015,WSG-TA 09-13,R/B-44,reprints (peer-reviewed),2009,NA,Washington Sea Grant,The non-host disease resistance response in peas; alterations in phosphorylation and ubiquitination of HMG A and histones H2A/H2B,"""Plant Science,"" 177:439-449, 2009.",10.1016/j.plant​sci.2009.07.007​,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a preliminary study designed to facilitate such a synthesis in Puget Sound, Washington, we identified five survey programs that spanned large fractions of this region during 1966-2007. We focused this initial review on Padilla Bay, one of the sites most heavily used by wintering and migrating birds on the Pacific Coast. Comparison for September to mid-May of Marine Ecosystems Analysis and Western Washington University shore- based surveys, two survey programs that used highly comparable methods, suggests that the combined density of all marine birds in Padilla Bay declined between 1978/79 and 2003-2006. These overall declines occurred mainly during early winter (November) and especially during spring migration (mid-March to mid-May). During spring migration, species assemblages were highly dissimilar between 1978/79 and 2003-2006. Of 27 species and species groups we considered, six increased and 13 declined. These declines occurred across foraging guilds and were large for many formerly abundant species. For example, typical maximum densities declined by about 75% (400/km2 to 100/km2) for Brant Branta bernicla, 80% (75/km2 to 15/km2) for scaup (mainly Greater Scaup Aythya marila) and 98% (>50/km2 to <1/km2) for Western Grebes Aechmophorus occidentalis. Results of aerial surveys during 1992-2007 by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife were consistent with most of the identified changes. Causes of decline are unclear for most species, but appear to be widespread.

The 15N tracer simulated deposition of 7.25 kg of salmon (fresh) to four 50-m2 plots. We added NH4+ (the initial product of salmon carcass decay) and other important nutrients provided by carcasses (P, S, K, Mg, Ca) to soils in late October 2003, coincident with local salmon spawning. We followed the 15N tracer through soil and tree pools for one year. Biological uptake of the 15N tracer occurred quickly: 64% of the 15N tracer was bound in soil microbiota within 14 days, and roots of the dominant riparian tree, western red cedar (Thuja plicata), began to take up 15N tracer within seven days. Root uptake continued through the winter. The 15N tracer content of soil organic matter reached a maximum of approx. 52%, five weeks after the application, and a relative equilibrium of approx. 40% within five months. Six months after the addition, in spring 2004, at least 37% of the 15N tracer was found in tree tissues: approx. 23% in foliage, approx. 11% in roots, and approx. 3% in stems. Within the stems, xylem and phloem sap contained approx. 96% of the tracer N, and approx. 4% was in structural xylem N. After one year, at least 28% of the 15N tracer was still found in trees, and loss from the plots was only approx. 20%. The large portion of tracer N taken up in the fall and reallocated to leaves and stems the following spring provides mechanistic evidence for a one-year-lagged tree-growth response to salmon nutrients. Salmon nutrients have been deposited in the Kennedy Creek system each fall for centuries, but the system shows no evidence of nutrient saturation.

CTD transect data show that in the long-term average over the May to September growing season, Willapa Bay is a sink for oceanic phytoplankton, not a net exporter: as the tidal circulation stirs ocean water into the estuary, chlorophyll concentration declines by 30 to 60% relative to a hypothetical dilution of the ocean end-member. A3Dcirculation model (General Estuarine Transport Model, GETM) was modified to include a phytoplankton-​like tracer subject to variable intertidal benthic grazing rates. The grazing rate that best reproduces the along-estuary phytoplankton biomass profile agrees, within confidence limits, with an estimate of cultivated-​oyster filtration from literature values. Oysters and other intertidal benthic grazers may thus be the primary cause of the net loss of phytoplankton within the estuary in summer. These grazers appear to be within a small factor of their carrying capacity: as bay-total filtration capacity is increased in the model, the chlorophyll intrusion shortens and food intake per individual grazer declines. Nevertheless, only 8 to 15% of the net tidal supply of oceanic phytoplankton is consumed within the estuary.

The suitability of this profiling approach for identifying the meter-scale plankton layers was verified through correlation analysis, which showed that in situ fluorescence was significantly correlated with all sub- sequent proxy measurements of phytoplankton abundance, including extracted chlorophyll a concentration and plankton biomass. Species abundance and community composition within and outside the layers were analyzed during peak layer occurrence in July 2005. Layers contained up to an order of magnitude more phytoplankton biomass than surrounding waters. Furthermore, this analysis showed that (1) plankton layers were horizontally coherent, because the species composition of samples from within PRLs from up to 5 stations collected on any given day were statistically indistinguishab​le; (2) layers were not continuous in time, since species composition changed significantly between sampling days; and (3) layers could have formed within East Sound, since no differences were observed in species composition among samples collected at any depth. Phytoplankton biomass was dominated by the diatom genus Chaetoceros (up to 95%), whereas heterotrophic protists (5 to 200um) were dominated by thecate dinoflagellates (up to 80% of biomass), with oligotrich ciliates and athecate dinoflagellates at times abundant (up to 40% of biomass). Motile heterotrophic protists were significantly aggregated within phytoplankton prey layers, which confirmed predictions from prior laboratory and modeling work. Biomass of phytoplankton prey species within PRLs uniformly exceeded the dominant predator's survival threshold, whereas prey concentrations outside PRLs would not support growth in all but 3 samples.

We found that range (extent), abundance, and effects on sediment and native plant species vary depending on the habitat invaded. S. anglica has by far the greatest range and abundance in mudflats and low salinity marshes compared to high salinity marshes and cobble beaches. Changes in sediment characteristics also substantially differed among habitats, with invaded areas in some habitats experiencing greater sediment accretion, water content, and salinity than other habitats. In addition, in opposition to the theory that strong invaders decrease species diversity, we found that native plant diversity in our plots increased within invaded areas in some habitats while it declined in others. These variable modifications suggest that single invaders, even species that are considered strong interactors, do not produce the same effect in all habitats.

After examining nine sites, we produced reconstructions for ﬁve mid-order rivers and four salmon species over a large geographic range in the Pacific Northwest: chinook (O. tschwatcha) in the Umpqua River, Oregon, USA; sockeye (O. nerka) in Drinkwater Creek, British Columbia, Canada; pink (O. gorbuscha) in Sashin Creek, southeastern Alaska, USA; chum (O. keta) in Disappearance Creek, southeastern Alaska, USA; and pink and chum in the Kadashan River, southeastern Alaska, USA. We ﬁrst derived stand-level, non-climatic growth chronologies from riparian trees using standard dendroecology methods and differencing. When the chronologies were compared to 18-55 years of adult salmon escapement we detected positive, significant correlations at five of the nine sites. Regression models relating escapement to tree- ring growth at the five sites were applied to the differenced chronologies to reconstruct salmon abundance. Each reconstruction contains unique patterns characteristic of the site and salmon species. Reconstructions were validated by comparison to local histories (e.g., construction of dams and salmon canneries) and regional ﬁsheries data such as salmon landings and aerial surveys and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation climate index. The reconstructions capture lower- frequency cycles better than extremes and are most useful for determination and comparison of relative abundance, cycles, and the effects of interventions. Reconstructions show lower population cycle maxima in both Umpqua River Chinook and Sashin Creek pink salmon in recent decades. The Drinkwater Creek reconstruction suggests that sockeye abundance since the mid-1990s has been 15-25% higher than at any time since 1850, while no long-term deviations from natural cycles are detected for salmon in the Kadashan River or in Disappearance Creek. Decadal-scale cycles in salmon abundance with periods of 25-68 years were detected in all of the reconstructions​. This novel approach provides river-specific, long- term perspectives on salmon abundance and cycles. Additionally, it provides a new frame of reference for maintaining and rebuilding individual stocks and for striking a balance between societal demands and the limited, always-changing salmon resource.","Drake, D.

Mark-recapture studies and abundance patterns in the estuary during 2000-2002 describe the following life-history types among Chinook salmon: (1) fry disperse throughout the estuary, and many move into restored tidal- marsh habitats in the early spring soon after emergence; (2) juveniles reside in freshwater for several months, enter the estuary in June or July, and remain for (a) a few weeks or (b) several months before entering the ocean; and (3) juveniles enter the ocean later in the fall after an extended period of rearing upriver and/or in the estuary. The absence of fry migrants in the estuary during spring and early summer in 1975-1977 d a period that precedes restoration of any of the diked marshes d and the extensive use of marsh habitats by fry and fingerlings April - July, 2000-2002 indicate that wetland restoration has increased estuarine rearing opportunities for juvenile Chinook salmon. Year-to-year patterns of estuarine rearing and abundance by juvenile salmon may be influenced by flood and drought conditions that affected adult spawner distribution and over-winter survival of salmon eggs. However, persistent changes in spawner distribution since 1975-1977, including the concentration of hatchery strays in the lower river, may account for the large proportion of fry that now disperse into the estuary soon after emergence in the spring. Although few of these earliest migrants survived to the river mouth, many fry and fingerlings from mid- and upper-basin spawning areas distributed throughout a greater portion of the estuary during the spring and summer and migrated to the ocean over a broader range of sizes and time periods than thirty years ago. The results suggest that wetland recovery has expanded life history variation in the Salmon River population by allowing greater expression of estuarine-​resident behaviors.","Bottom, Daniel L.;Jones, Kim K.;Cornwell, Trevan J.;Gray, Ayesha;Simenstad, Charles A.",WASHU-R-05-018,WSG-TA 05-25,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),2005,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Patterns of Chinook salmon migration and residency in the Salmon River estuary (Oregon),"""Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science,"" 64:79-93, 2005.",10.1016/j.ecss.​2005.02.008,NA,NA,NA,NA

Salmon were sampled as they bypassed the dam, parentage was assigned based on genotypes from 10 microsatellite loci, and standardized selection gradients were calculated using the number of returning adult offspring as the fitness metric. Larger fish in both sexes produced more adult offspring, and the magnitude of the effect increased in subsequent years for males, suggesting that low densities attenuated traditional size-biased intrasexual competition. For both sexes, directional selection favoured early breeders in 2003, but stabilizing selection on breeding date was observed in 2004 and 2005. Adults that arrived, and presumably bred, early produced stream-rearing juvenile offspring that were larger at a common date than offspring from later parents, providing a possible mechanism linking breeding date to offspring viability. Comparison to studies employing similar methodology indicated selection during colonization was strong, particularly with respect to reproductive timing. Finally, female mean reproductive success exceeded that needed for replacement in all years so the population expanded in the first generation, demonstrating that salmon can proficiently exploit vacant habitat.","Anderson, J.

Sentinel field studies (2000-2003) were conducted in Tomales Bay in order to better understand the role of environmental factors (temperature, phytoplankton, and salinity) and oyster health (measured using histology and/or OsHV-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)) on Pacific oyster survival. Elevated temperatures were the only environmental factor consistently related to mortalities (2000-2003), and in 2003, elevated temperature means predicted OsHV presence (p < 0.005); OsHV presence predicted mortality (p=0.01). A separate survey conducted in 2003 detected OsHV in multiple species of bivalves grown in Tomales Bay (C. gigas, Ostrea edulis, C. virginica, C. sikamea, Mytilus galloprovincial​is, and Venerupis phillipinarum) and C. gigas grown in nearby Drakes Bay using OsHV-specific PCR and/or quantitative PCR (qPCR); qPCR copy numbers were low in each species tested but were significantly greater in C. gigas (p < 0.0001) the only species that appear to be impacted by mortalities.

Management approaches such as translocations and supportive breeding between closely related populations may affect gene flow and overall structure, and therefore viability. Here, we examined temporal changes in the fine-scale population structure of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) by comparing archived (1938) and modern (2001-2005) populations in six rivers within a single conservation unit (Puget Sound, Washington) sampled before and after an extended period of between-river transfers and releases of millions of cultured salmon. Genotype frequencies at eight microsatellite loci showed that current populations descended from historical Puget Sound populations, but populations in different rivers that exchanged fish for hatchery propagation share more of their ancestry recently than they did historically. Historically, populations in different rivers were isolated by geographic distance, but that relation- ship is no longer significant. Allelic richness among all populations declined significantly, suggesting that genetic drift has increased because of a population bottleneck. Populations in different rivers and within the same river have become more diverged, providing further evidence for a widespread bottle- neck. Previously, we observed that genetic distance significantly decreased with the number of fish exchanged; however, some populations apparently resisted introgression. Altered gene flow and lost diversity may affect the complexity, and therefore resiliency of sub-populations within a conservation unit. Plans for artificial culture need to maintain existing genetic diversity and avoid disrupting the fine-scale structure by using local populations for parents whenever possible.","Eldridge, W.

Translocations, reintroductions and supportive breeding can affect population structure, and fishing may be an important evolutionary force by changing the mean length and age of mature individuals, although fishing gear, locations and genetic correlations can affect the response. Paired comparisons of microsatellite DNA divergence of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) from different rivers around Puget Sound, Washington in 1938 indicated that the genetic differentiation was correlated with the geographic distance, consistent with a stepping stone model of isolation. Hatcheries have released millions of individuals of within river or within Puget Sound ancestry during the intervening years. The genetic differentiation between pairs of recently sampled rivers was no longer correlated with the geographic distance but with the number of individuals transferred between the two rivers. The genetic diversity among populations within rivers also declined with increased numbers of local origin individuals released. These results indicate that hatchery practices since 1938 have altered the pattern of gene flow among rivers, and homogenized populations within rivers. To evaluate fishery-induced changes to the mean length and age of mature individuals, we coupled a quantitative genetic model for length at ages zero through five, considering a range of genetic correlations, with population dynamics models parameterized from real Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations to simulate 100 years of harvest using 1) gillnets, which impose disruptive selection, or 2) long-lines, which impose minimum size selection, and targeting a) immature individuals in the high-seas, or b) mature individuals in the terminal area. The most abundant age class present during harvest usually dictated the overall response when traits were positively or negative correlated. In the high-seas this was the youngest age harvested or an older age in the terminal area. Selection differentials for the older ages were initially small for long-lines because we assumed only 50% of individuals within the selection window were harvested. Therefore, a long-line terminal fishery caused the least change. The results presented here reveal that human impacts on the genetic diversity may make salmon less resilient to environmental change, but also suggest management strategies to reduce those impacts.","Eldridge, William H.",WASHU-Y-07-001,WSG-TH 07-01,E/I-11,theses/disserta​tions,2007,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Human impacts on the genetic diversity of Pacific salmon through hatcheries and harvest (PhD dissertation),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, owing to the functional relationships among parameters in deterministic age-structured population dynamics models, placing explicit priors on each life history parameter in addition to the population growth rate parameter results in an incoherent joint prior distribution (i.e. two different priors on the estimated parameters). One solution to constructing a coherent joint prior is to solve for juvenile survival analytically, using values generated from the prior distributions for the remaining parameters. However, certain combinations of model parameter values result in values for juvenile survival that are larger than adult survival, which is biologically implausible. Therefore, to respect biological realism, certain parameter values must be rejected for some or all the remaining parameters. This study investigates several alternative resampling schemes for obtaining a realistic joint prior distribution, given the constraint on survival rates. The sensitivity of assessment results is investigated for data-rich (bowhead) and data-poor (walrus) scenarios.

Eleven microsatellite loci were surveyed in 23 hatchery and wild samples collected from 11 rivers within and one hatchery outside Puget Sound.

Number of fish released from hatcheries that collect broodstock locally was negatively correlated with population structure within rivers ( t-test P = 0.002), and between nearby rivers (partial Mantel P = 0.04).

Results: Bioinformatic analysis of the Heterosigma akashiwo chloroplast genome sequence revealed the presence of a single two- component His-to-Asp (designated Tsg1/Trg1) pair in this stramenopile (golden-brown alga). These data represent the first documentation of a His-to-Asp array in stramenopiles and counter previous reports suggesting that such regulatory proteins are lacking in this taxonomic cluster. Comparison of the 43 kDa H. akashiwo Tsg1 with bacterial sensor kinases showed that the algal protein exhibits a moderately maintained PAS motif in the sensor kinase domain as well as highly conserved H, N, G1 and F motifs within the histidine kinase ATP binding site. Molecular modelling of the 27 kDa H. akashiwo Trg1 regulator protein was consistent with a winged helix-​turn-​helix identity - a class of proteins that is known to impact gene expression at the level of transcription. The occurrence of Trg1 protein in actively growing H. akashiwo cells was verified by Western analysis. The presence of a PhoB- like RNA polymerase loop in Trg1 and its homologues in the red-algal lineage support the hypothesis that Trg1 and its homologues interact with a sigma 70 (!70) subunit (encoded by rpoD) of a eubacterial type polymerase. Sequence analysis of H. akashiwo rpoD showed this nuclear-encoded gene has a well-defined 4.2 domain, a region that augments RNA polymerase interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins and also serves in -35 promoter recognition. The presence/loss of the His-to-Asp pairs in primary and secondary chloroplast lineages is assessed. Conclusion: His-to-Asp signal transduction components are found in most rhodophytic chloroplasts, as well as in their putative cyanobacterial progenitors. The evolutionary conservation of these proteins argues that they are important for the maintenance of chloroplast homeostasis. Our data suggest that chloroplast gene transcription may be impacted by the interaction of the His- to-Asp regulator protein (which is less frequently lost than the sensor protein) with the RNA polymerase !70 subunit.","Duplessis, Melinda R.;Karol, Kenneth G.;Adman, Elinor T.;Choi, Lauren Ys;Jacobs, Michael A.;Cattolico, Rose Ann",WASHU-R-07-014,WSG-TA 07-22,R/B-48;R/B-42,reprints (peer-reviewed),2007,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Chloroplast His-to-Asp signal transduction: a potential mechanism for plastid gene regulation in Heterosigma akashiwo (Raphidophyceae​),"""BMC Evolutionary Biology,"" 70:1-15, May 2007.",10.1186/1471-​2148-​7-​70,NA,NA,NA,NA

These mortality events occur during the late summer when water temperatures are at their highest. Many theories have been proposed concerning the causes including reproductive stress, environmental stress, disease, or synergistic interactions of these factors. C. gigas are grown intertidally and are exposed to the air (emersed) for hours at a time. These organisms can experience extreme changes in temperature during the course of a day. An oyster closed during emersion depletes the oxygen stores to near zero within the shell and builds up CO2 causing a decrease in tissue pH. The focus of this study is to determine the respiratory (pH, Po2, Pco2 and total CO2) and immune responses of oysters exposed to air at normal seasonal temperatures, and to determine whether these stresses associated with emersion inhibit the immune system of the oyster and contribute to the summer mortalities. The respiratory variables of the hemolymph of oysters submerged at 18 �C (pH = 7.52 � 0.04 S.E.M., Po2 = 7.09 � 0.53 S.E.M. kPa and Pco2 = 0.20 � 0.03 S.E. M. kPa) varied significantly from oysters emersed for four hours at 22�C (pH = 7.11 � 0.03 S.E.M., Po2 = 3.83 � 0.15 S.E.M. kPa, Pco2 = 0.36 � 0.03 S.E. M. kPa) and those emersed for four hours at 30 �C (pH = 6.84 � 0.02 S.E.M., Po2 = 3.10 � 0.12 S.E.M. kPa, Pco2 = 1.31 � 0.06 S.E.M. kPa). The ability of hemocytes to kill the bacterium Vibrio campbellii was assessed using an in vitro assay to generate a killing index. There was no significant difference in the killing index between pH treatment groups (p = 0.856): at pH 7.6 killing index = 50.2% � 2.33 S.E.M., at pH 6.6 killing index = 52.3% � 3.67 S.E.M.. Temperature was the only factor to significantly affect the killing indices among temperature and oxygen treatment groups. The killing index was lowest (29.3% � 3.25 S.E.M.) at 30 �C and 7% oxygen, simulating in vivo oxygen pressure in well-aerated conditions and 30 �C and 3% oxygen, simulating in vivo oxygen pressure in hypoxia (30.5% +/- 3.25 S.E.M.), compared with the index in 7% oxygen at low temperature (18 �C) (44.4% +/- 4.50 S.E.M.) or compared with low oxygen (3%) at low temperature (18 �C) (39.7% +/- 2.51 S.E.M.). The seasonal and diurnal rise in temperature may, therefore, be an important factor contributing to summer mortalities of C. gigas.","Allen, Steven M.;Burnett, Louis E.",WASHU-R-08-015,WSG-TA 08-18,R/F-154,reprints (peer-reviewed),2008,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"The effects of intertidal air exposure on the respiratory physiology and the killing activity of hemocytes in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg)","""Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,"" 357(2):165-171, 2008.",10.1016/j.jembe​.2008.01.013,NA,NA,NA,NA

Management actions targeted at removing these invaders and restoring native populations may have knock-on effects on non-target native species and ecosystems. For example, coastal dunes in the Pacific Northwest of North America are nearly monocultures of the introduced beachgrasses, Ammophila arenaria and Ammophila breviligulata. These invasive grasses have converted open, low-lying sand dunes with a sparse covering of native plants to tall, densely-​vegetated ridges dominated by the two invaders. As a result, the critical open-sand habitat of the federally threatened Western Snowy plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus) has declined along with populations of several native dune plant species. Here we investigate how nearly 20 years of management targeted at the removal of Ammophila for plover recovery are impacting native plant species and dune morphology along 500 km of coastline in Oregon and Washington, USA. Despite increased plovers and decreased Ammophila in treated areas, plover habitat restoration also has had the unintentional effect of reducing the richness and abundance of native dune plants. Additionally, frequent Ammophila removal has prevented the re-​establishment of the natural disturbance regime and dune function. Based on these findings, we suggest that the Pacific Northwest coastal dune ecosystem would benefit from a more synthetic community-wide management approach.","Zarnetske, Phoebe L.;Seabloom, Eric W.;Hacker, Sally D.",ORESU-R-10-010,ORESU-R-10-010,R/CNH-15;R/ECO-19,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,"Non-target effects of invasive species management: beachgrass, birds, and bulldozers in coastal dunes","""Ecosphere,"" 1(5):(Article 13) 1-20, November 2010.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One hypothesis is that these dramatic declines in productivity may be related to increasing ocean acidity and the corresponding decrease in the saturation state of carbonate minerals which shellfish use to create their shells. The West Coast shellfish industry sought help from scientists to explore the causes of the shellfish losses, what role ocean acidification and other factors might be playing, and how to adapt to sustain West Coast shellfish resources. Addressing questions about ocean acidification requires integration of ocean observing measurements, laboratory exposure studies, shellfish recruitment and production data, and field studies of organism performance in relation to ocean conditions. However, these data are collected by different sectors that, to date, have had limited interaction. To stimulate collaborations among these sectors, and at the request of the shellfish farming and wild harvest communities, the Integrated Ocean Observing Systems, California Sea Grant, USC Sea Grant, Oregon Sea Grant, Washington Sea Grant, and California Ocean Science Trust convened a workshop. Fifty‐one participants were invited, including state and federal managers, industry representatives​, and leading academic researchers and oceanographers with expertise in larval recruitment, laboratory studies, and ocean chemistry. The workshop consisted of 8 plenary talks and three breakout sessions. The plenary presentations provided information summarizing OA research as related to impacts on the west coast shellfish industry including: monitoring programs, laboratory exposure studies, and industry observations. In the first breakout session, participants separated into three groups to outline existing and ongoing data sets, as well as what is needed to answer questions on OA impacts on the West Coast in three areas: oceanographic data, recruitment data, and exposure study data. In the second breakout session participants discussed how existing data sets can be better integrated to clarify impacts of OA and discuss what is needed for future studies both in the near‐shor​e and open‐ocea​n. In the third breakout session, three working groups discussed how to integrate existing research programs and develop future programs to better address impacts of OA on the West Coast. The workshop concluded with a summary of findings and recommendations for next steps.","Dickson, Andrew",CASG-W-10-001,Technical Report 624,C/P-1,conference/work​shop proceedings,2010,NA,California Sea Grant,Ocean acidification impacts on shellfish workshop: findings and recommendations,"The West Coast Ocean Acidification Shellfish Workshop,"" workshop proceedings, Report #624, Costa Mesa, California, July 7-8, 2010.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Firstly, the ability of sonication to degrade these PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene) in aqueous solution was investigated. Pyrene had the fastest sonolytic degradation rate compared to naphthalene and phenanthrene, a trend opposite to Henry's law and diffusion coefficients for these three compounds. Based on the degradation trend, pyrene appeared to accumulate to a greater extent at the gas/solution interface of the cavitation bubbles compared to naphthalene and phenanthrene. Once on the interface, pyrene reacts more efficiently with OH radicals compared to reactions in bulk solution, which is dependent on the diffusion of OH radicals from cavitation bubbles to bulk solution. Decreased formation of hydroxyterephth​alate, a measure of bulk solution OH radical, during sonolysis in the presence of pyrene but not in the presence of naphthalene or phenanthrene was consistent with pyrene accumulation on cavitation bubble interfaces. In addition, increased bulk solution temperature and naphthalene solution concentration increased the degradation rates of naphthalene. These two operating parameters increased the amount of naphthalene diffusing into cavitation bubbles available for pyrolysis. Finally, sonolytic degradation rate constants with 0.5 μM each of these PAHs in a mixture were lower compared to sonolysis of aqueous solutions containing these compounds individually. Naphthalene and phenanthrene, which diffused faster than pyrene, inhibited the accumulation of pyrene at the interface. Conversely, pyrene on cavitation bubble interfaces reacted with interfacial OH decreasing [OH] in bulk solution available for reaction with naphthalene and phenanthrene. Secondly, the application of ultrasound for remediation of PAHs in freshwater sediments was examined with the aim of exploiting the ability of ultrasound to promote desorption of contaminants from sediments for sonolytic degradation and understanding the effect of sonolysis on bioaccessibilit​y of the sediment. After 60 min sonolysis of 12.5 g L-1 of natural sediment suspended in MilliQ water, the combined solution and sediment concentrations of naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene extracted were reduced by 23 %, 15 %, and 23 %, respectively. This reduction in concentration is a result of sonodegradation and/or occlusion of PAHs into the particles. Decrease in solid-liquid ratio below 12.5 g L-1 resulted in reduction in the rate of sonodegradation and/or occlusion of the PAHs due to low particle concentration resulting in decrease particle-​particle collisions and microjets formation which facilitated mass transfer of PAHs desorption. An increase in the solid-liquid ratio above 12.5 g L-1 resulted in a decrease in the rates of sonodegradation and/or occlusion of the PAHs. This decrease was attributed to reduced ultrasonic intensity as a result of sound attenuation in the presence of excess sediment particles and/or limitations in the solubility of PAHs. In addition to sonodegradation​, the fast desorbing fraction of pyrene, which has been related to bioaccessibilit​y, was found to increase with sonication time of 20min followed by a plateau of a slight decrease at 120 min. Sonolysis of particles facilitated the desorption of PAHs through localized turbulent liquid movement, microjets formation and particles fragmentation, exposing new surfaces to the aqueous phase, thus decreasing the slow fraction of Phenanthrene and pyrene. This result suggested that ultrasound irradiation of natural sediment can release the PAHs on the slow desorbing sites. Although PAHs on these slow sites are less accessible, they are potential source for PAHs release and are difficult to treat using bioremediation due to limitation on their desorption rates. Thus the potential of decreasing these fractions using sonolysis is important. Lastly, the use of powdered activated carbon (PAC) amendment and sonication was employed to reduce the bioaccessibilit​y of PAHs in these three creosote contaminated sediments. For these three sediments, sonochemically induced switching of phenanthrene and pyrene from sediment to PAC was more effective than mechanical mixing in decreasing the fast desorbing fraction (FFast) (i.e., % reduction in FFast; ultrasound: EH= 91 � 3 %, GI = 67 � 3 %, and LS = 67 � 3 %, mixing: EH= 81 � 3 %, GI = 42 � 3 %, and LS = 53 � 3 %). The enhancement effect observed for sediment treated with sonication was attributed to the facilitation of desorption of PAHs through localized turbulent liquid movement, microjets formation and particles fragmentation, exposing new surfaces to the aqueous phase.","Pee, Gim-Yang",OHSU-Y-08-001,OHSU-TD-114,R/PS-030,theses/disserta​tions,2008,NA,Ohio Sea Grant,Sonochemical remediation of freshwater sediments contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These beaches represent a recreational outlet for over 30 million people (US EPA and Government of Canada, 1995) and yet many of them remain inaccessible for periods of time each bathing season due to water quality advisories. The reason for these advisories is often elusive to beach managers, hence impeding their ability to craft appropriate mitigation measures. Even when the sources of contamination are known, remediation measures may not be put into practice due to the perception that they are too costly. However, a recent study has demonstrated that investing in environmental improvements which increase the number of days available for swimming in the Great Lakes region by 20% would generate $2–$3 billion dollars in direct economic effects. Therefore, while beach closings and advisories continue to rise overall, some Great Lakes communities have recognized the potential for municipal beaches to generate revenue and increase the quality of life for their citizens and have undertaken comprehensive studies to improve recreational water quality. In Racine, Wisconsin, USA, research conducted to identify pollution sources guided the development of better beach management practices such as ecologically appropriate beach modifications, improved mechanical beach grooming strategies, and the redesign of a major storm water outlet (including installation of a constructed wetland area). Resulting improvements have reduced bathing water quality advisories from 66% of days during the swimming season in 2000 to 5% or less in four consecutive years (2005–2008). These improvements to Racine beaches facilitated Blue Wave certification from the Clean Beaches Council (Washington, DC); thereby restoring public confidence, increasing beach use by the residents and tourists, and expanding the role of the beachfront in the local economy.","Kinzelman, Julie L.;McLellan, Sandra L.",WISCU-R-09-019,WISCU-R-09-019,R/UC-2,reprints (peer-reviewed),2009,NA,Wisconsin Sea Grant,"Success of science-based best management practices in reducing swimming bans--a case study from Racine, Wisconsin, USA","Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management, 12(2):187-196, 2009",10.1080/1463498​0902907466,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW), coastal foredune geomorphology is determined by both physical and ecological mechanisms. Before the 1900's, the native plant Elymus mollis was the dominant dune grass and dune morphology was largely determined by sediment supply and other physical factors. The introduction of two different invasive beach grasses in the first half of the 20th century resulted in significant changes to PNW foredune geomorphology. Recent work has shown that the invasive beach grass Ammophila arenaria is associated with taller, narrower foredunes while the grass Ammophila breviligulata is associated with shorter, broader foredunes. We hypothesize that this may impact coastal vulnerability as the taller, narrower foredunes may be more resistant to overtopping, but less resistant to erosion, while the shorter, broader foredunes may be more resistant to erosion, but less resistant to overtopping. The work presented in this thesis is part of a larger, interdisciplina​ry effort to determine the relative importance of physical and ecological mechanisms in controlling coastal foredune geomorphology and vulnerability in the PNW. Airborne topographic lidar data is used to characterize the regional variability in foredune geomorphology within several littoral cells, subcells, and beaches of the PNW. We present and discuss techniques to automatically and accurately extract foredune morphometric parameters from a lidar elevation data set of the coasts of Oregon and Washington. If the different grass species do affect foredune geomorphology, it is important to understand how managing them might impact coastal vulnerability. Therefore, we use the geomorphologica​l parameters and measured hydrodynamic parameters during a major winter storm to estimate vulnerability to overtopping and erosion at beaches with distinctly different foredunes.

As climate change-related processes continue to enhance coastal hazards (e.g., erosion and flooding), communities in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) need to know where and how to respond to best protect lives, livelihoods, infrastructure, and resources. Vulnerability to climate change-enhanced hazards is not simply a matter of characterizing threatening physical processes but also involves assessing the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of human-​environmental systems that influence the potential for future impacts. The threats posed by climate change to PNW coastal communities can be more accurately communicated by integrating improved hazard models that incorporate climate-change controls with information on the vulnerability of communities to these hazards. To examine the influence of climate-change on community vulnerability to coastal hazards, we assessed variations in current and future societal vulnerability in Tillamook (Oregon) and Pacific (Washington) Counties. Model predictions of natural hazards under various climate-change scenarios are combined with current and projected socioeconomic indices using geographic-​information-​system (GIS) tools. Results suggest variations in exposure and sensitivity to hazards relate to city size? larger communities may experience great losses to future coastal hazards that reflect only a small portion of their community while smaller communities may experience relatively smaller losses that devastate them. Community vulnerability information can be used to further develop local land-use, hazard-​mitigation, and emergency-​management plans to incorporate risks posed by climate change-induced hazards.","Baron, Heather M.;Wood, Nathan J.;Ruggiero, Peter;Corcoran, Patrick",ORESU-WR-10-026,ORESU-WR-10-026,A/ESG-07,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2010,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,Assessing societal vulnerability of U.S. Pacific Northwest communities to storm-induced coastal change,"""Shifting Shorelines: Adapting To the Future, the 22nd International Conference of the Coastal Society,"" Wilmington, North Carolina, June 13-16, 2010.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The future of bivalve shellfish aquaculture in the U.S. hinges on sustainable practices on the part of industry and a more consistent regulatory regime. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture is a recent practice relative to its history in other countries, beginning in the late 1800s along the U.S. West Coast where it is now well established with farm raised product utilizing land-based hatcheries and grow-out directly in numerous estuaries. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture can be viewed as a disturbance which modifies the estuarine system in three ways: 1) changes in material processes ? bivalves process food and produce wastes; 2) addition of physical structure ? aquaculture introduces the cultured organisms and in some cases a physical anchoring structure; and 3) pulse disturbances like harvest and bed maintenance disturb sediments, remove species in addition to the cultured organisms themselves, and change resource or habitat availability. In U.S.West Coast estuaries, water column and sediment nutrient concentrations are relatively high and influenced by large tidal exchange and proximity to deeper nearshore ocean waters where upwelling controls production during summer months. Bivalves are unlikely to influence material processes except at local bed scales in these systems, although estuary-wide effects could appear as the fraction of cultured area rises or in poorly flushed bays. Bivalve culture clearly modifies estuarine habitat at local community and at landscape scales and effects are most often evaluated against existing structured habitat in the form of submerged aquatic vegetation. Individual activities act as pulse disturbances and the recovery of eelgrass (Zostera marina) to predisturbance levels is variable (b2 to N5 years). The extent of disturbance depends on the aquaculture practice and the distribution of eelgrass reflects a balance of space competition, pulse disturbance and recovery, and is therefore at dynamic equilibrium on aquaculture beds. Structure provided by aquaculture appears functionally similar to eelgrass for small benthic infauna and mobile epibenthic fauna while use of aquaculture as habitat by larger more mobile invertebrates and fish depends on mobility and varies with lifehistory stage and taxon being evaluated. Scale seems a very important management consideration and further research at estuarine landscape scales, especially for habitat use by important invertebrates and fish, may prove useful in designing and implementing best management practices. Though local and short term effects from aquaculture are clearly evident in U.S.West Coast estuaries, bivalve aquaculture does not remove area from the estuary or degrade water quality like other anthropogenic influences, and thus has not been implicated in shifts to alternate states or reduced adaptive capacity of the larger ecological system.","Dumbauld, Brett;Ruesink, Jennifer;Rumrill, Steven",WASHU-R-09-020,WSG-TA 09-18,R/ES-42,reprints (peer-reviewed),2009,NA,Washington Sea Grant,The ecological role of bivalve shellfish aquaculture in the estuarine environment: a review with application to oyster and clam culture in West Coast (USA) estuaries,"""Aquaculture,"" 290(3-​4):196-​223, 2009.",10.1016/j.aquac​ulture.2009.02.​033,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such 'supply-side' effects have been relatively poorly studied in soft-sediment habitats because of the difficulty of sampling very small infaunal recruits. I investigated whether spatial patterns of infaunal recruitment along an estuarine gradient could account for the observed cline in adult diversity. On 9 occasions spread over 13 mo, cores of sterile sediment from 2 different sources were embedded in beaches along the estuarine axis of Puget Sound, Washington, and sampled 6 wk later for new recruits. Identities and abundances of recruits (mostly polychaetes and bivalves) varied among seasons, but differed little between sediments from different sources.

For a number of taxa and time periods, recruitment was actually stronger at the southern beaches. Multivariate differences between assemblages of recruits and adults were much greater at the southern sites, indicating that post-​recruitment processes at these sites modify diversity and abundance patterns initially established by recruitment.

However, to date, insufficient quantitative information exists on larval swimming to understand and predict swimming movements in most marine invertebrate species. Previous work suggests that larvae swim more slowly at lower temperatures and, consequently, might have difficulty regulating depth when experiencing temperature changes. Improved diet quality in terms of essential fatty acid composition has been suggested to increase cold tolerance in many organisms. We used non-invasive video-tracking techniques to quantify swimming in larvae of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus, raised on 4 algal diets differing in their fatty acid profiles and then exposed to an ecologically relevant temperature decrease from 20 to 12�C. Differences in diet quality led to significant morphological differences by the 8-arm larval stage, and there were significant diet-​temperature interaction effects on swimming patterns. While larval swimming speeds decreased as temperature decreased across all diet treatments, net vertical velocities of larvae did not decrease. Changes in helical geometries of larval swimming trajectories suggest that larvae compensate for reduced swimming speeds by reducing horizontal movement, thus preserving their ability to regulate depth. The observed compensatory mechanism effectively circumvents constraints on swimming due to lowered temperatures. More generally, video-tracking of free-swimming larvae can yield quantitative data to inform biophysically coupled models that better predict consequences of larval dispersal for adult population dynamics under current and future environmental conditions.","Chan, K.

Fishing may be an important evolutionary force that can change the distribution of fitness-related traits; however, the magnitude and direction of the evolutionary response may be influenced by different management strategies. Most phenotypic traits subject to human-induced selection are simultaneously influenced by the environment and by genetic variation, and many traits are genetically correlated. Here, we evaluated the evolutionary outcomes of harvest activities on mean length and age at maturity in a fish population by coupling a multivariate quantitative genetic model with a Leslie life history matrix model. Lengths-at-ages were treated as genetically correlated characters parameterized from empirical data on chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations. Using simulations, we explored the outcomes of 100 years of harvest using gill nets, which impose disruptive selection, or longlines, which impose minimum size selection, that targeted immature individuals in the high seas or maturing individuals in terminal spawning areas. Response in mean length and age depended on selection differentials imposed by harvest (which depended in turn on fishing location, gear type, and proportion of the population harvested) and on the genetic correlations between traits. Mean length was strongly influenced by the selection differential of the most abundant age class. Large differences in response were observed between the high-seas fishery, where the most abundant age was the youngest age vulnerable to harvest, compared to the terminal area fishery, where an older age class was most abundant. We observed a substantial difference in response between gill nets and longlines in the terminal fishery only. The evolution of mean age of mature individuals was less predictable, but generally increased as length decreased and decreased as length increased. The model presented here has potential for incorporating empirical data into fisheries forecasting and therefore provides a powerful means of integrating evolutionary considerations into harvest management.","Eldridge, William H.;Hard, Jeffery J.;Naish, Kerry A.",WASHU-R-10-013,WSG-TA 10-13,E/I-11,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Simulating fishery-induced evolution in chinook salmon: the role of harvest gear, location and genetic correlation among traits","""Ecological Applications,"" 20(7):1936-​1948, 2010.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The chloroplast genomes of A. anophagefferens (89,599 bp) and Ar. lagunensis (94,346 bp) are significantly smaller than those of six other stramenopiles sequenced to date. The structure (or configuration) is partially due to the absence of the large inverted repeats common in chloroplast genomes. Eight of 10 small and tandem repeats from the A. anophagefferens and Ar. lagunensis genomes are adjacent to genes coding for photosynthetic or energy production functions, implying that these domains may have functional constraints. High genomic synteny, a multigene phylogenetic analysis, and a synapomorphic change in the form of an attenuated psbA gene confirm that A. anophagefferens and Ar. lagunensis are closely related taxa. Finally, the presence of three light-​independent chl-​biosynthesis genes in the chloroplast of Ar. lagunensis, but absence in the chloroplast and nuclear genomes of A. anophagefferens​, suggests the persistence of a more ancient (i.e., dark-adaptive) potential in Ar. lagunensis but not in A. anophagefferens​.

Like floodplains elsewhere, many of the approximately 200 coastal river valleys are profoundly altered by flow regulation and land conversion for agriculture and urban development, and these activities have contributed to widespread declines in anadromous fishes and environmental quality. Some of the coastal river valleys, however, still retain many of their natural features, thereby providing important reference sites. Understanding fundamental biophysical processes underpinning natural floodplain characteristics is essential for successfully protecting and restoring ecological integrity, including inherent goods and services. This article examines factors underpinning the ecological characteristics of PCE floodplains, particularly riparian soils and trees. Drawing on over two decades of research and literature, we describe the spatial and temporal characteristics of physical features for alluvial PCE floodplains, examine the importance of sediment deposition and associated biogeochemical processes in floodplain soil formation, quantify vegetative succession and production dynamics of riparian trees, discuss how epiphytes, marine-derived nutrients, and soil processes contribute to tree production, describe the roles and importance of large dead wood in the system, the role of termites in its rapid decomposition, and show how large wood contributes to vegetative succession. These highly interconnected features and associated processes are summarized in a model of system-scale drivers and changes occurring over several centuries. Collectively, this integrated perspective has strong implications for floodplain rehabilitation, and we identify appropriate metrics for evaluating floodplain condition and functions. We draw heavily from our own experience on several well-studied rivers, recognizing additional studies are needed to evaluate the generality of concepts presented herein. As in any complex adaptive system, fundamental uncertainties remain and constraints imposed by the legacies of past human actions persist. Nevertheless, the evolving knowledge base is improving conservation strategies of lightly modified floodplains and is supporting the incorporation of emerging process-based perspectives into the rehabilitation of heavily modified systems.","Naiman, Robert J.;Bechtold, Jeffery Scott;Beechie, Timothy J.;Latterell, Joshua J.;Pelt, Robert Van",WASHU-R-10-015,WSG-TA 10-16,R/F-152,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,NA,Washington Sea Grant,A Process-Based View of Floodplain Forest Patterns in Coastal River Valleys of the Pacific Northwest,"Ecosystems, 13:1-31, 2010",10.1007/s10021-​009-​9298-​5,NA,NA,NA,NA

Instead, catch MTL trends often diverge from ecosystem MTL trends obtained from surveys and assessments. In contrast to previous findings of rapid declines in catch MTL3, we observe recent increases in catch, survey and assessment MTL.

We report on a year-long study of cyst dormancy and germination potential based on experiments using surface sediment collected from a shallow embayment, Quartermaster Harbor, in Puget Sound. Cyst abundance in Quartermaster Harbor was 1550?1750 cysts cm3 when sediment was collected inmid-October 2006. Germination experiments set up monthly had germination occur in all months when cysts were provided with adequate growth supporting conditions. Germination rates were highest in May and June when 100% germination occurred within 2 days. Longer incubation periods observed for the first two months of the study (November and December) may indicate a mandatory dormancy period of up to 5 months if the majority of cysts were deposited in the sediments following a late summer bloom that apparently occurred in Quartermaster Harbor in 2006 as indicated by Washington State Department of Health's toxin records. The data provide no evidence of an endogenous clock restricting germination to a specific annual timeframe for these shallow water cysts. This contrasts with the presence of a circannual endogenous clock, for deep water cysts of A. fundyense in the Gulf of Maine. The significance of these results is that germination of the A. catenella Puget Sound population appears to be primarily regulated by physiological requirements.

Marine survival was most strongly related to the average body size in July, with larger sizes associated with higher survivals. This relationship was consistent over multiple years (1997?2002), suggesting that mortality after July is strongly size-dependent.

The study confirmed the daily periodicity of otolith growth increments in a natural fish population under field conditions and validated fundamental assumptions about increased otolith strontium : calcium values during entry into saline waters. The otolith results indicated that more than 75% of the subyearling Chinook salmon captured near the mouth of the Salmon River had entered the estuary during the summer and that two-thirds of these fish had spent more than a month in the estuary before capture. Unlike in other Oregon coastal estuaries, in which the fingerling-​migrant portion of their life histories is dominant, approximately two-thirds of Salmon River Chinook salmon in upper-estuary marshes were early fry (,50- mm) migrants. A much smaller proportion at the river mouth suggests that many fry migrants did not survive to the lower estuary or passed undetected during ocean emigration. Nonetheless, the otolith results reveal a substantially greater contribution of estuarine-​rearing fry to the out-migrant population at the Salmon River than has been reported in other Oregon coastal basins. A small component of fall-migrating fish with long freshwater residence times also occurred at the river mouth. Most of these individuals had migrated quickly through the estuary. Rather than revealing a series of discrete ''types'' defined by the predominant rearing patterns in the population, the individual otolith results depict a continuum of freshwater and estuarine life histories that is consistent with reports of considerable phenotypic plasticity in Chinook salmon. Otolith analysis offers the potential to quantify the relative contributions of different juvenile rearing patterns to adult returns.","Volk, Eric Chuan;Bottom, Daniel L.;Jones, Kim K.;Simenstad, Charles A.",WASHU-R-10-018,WSG-TA 10-18,NA,reprints (peer-reviewed),2010,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Reconstructing Juvenile Chinook Salmon Life History in the Salmon River Estuary, Oregon, Using Otolith Microchemistry and Microstructure","""Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,"" 139(2):535-549, 2010.",10.1+577/T08-​163.1,NA,NA,NA,NA

In their ""Joint Appeal Against Human and Animal Patenting,"" the group stated: ""We, the undersigned religious leaders, oppose the patenting of human and animal life forms. We are disturbed by the U.S. Patent Office's recent decision to patent body parts and several genetically engineered animals. We believe that humans and animals are creations of God, not humans, and as such should not be patented as human invention."" Remarks such as this worry the biotech industry, which has come to expect as a result of decisions over two decades by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and by the courts that genes, cells, and multicellular animals are eligible for patent protection. The industry is concerned because religious leaders have considerable influence and because their point of view is consistent with the longtime legal precedent that products of nature are not patentable. Representatives of the biotech industry argue that their religious critics fail to understand the purpose of patent law. According to the industry view, patents create temporary legal monopolies to encourage useful advances in knowledge; they have no moral or theological implications. The differences between the two groups are not irreconcilable. The religious leaders are not opposed to biotechnology, and the industry has no interest in being declared the Creator of life. The path to common ground must begin with an understanding of the two purposes of patent law.","Sagoff, Mark",MDU-NR-98-001,UM-SG-RS-98-19,NA,reprints (not peer-reviewed),1998,NA,Maryland Sea Grant,Patented genes: an ethical appraisal,"""Issues in Science and Technology Online: Perspectives,"" pp. 73-71, Spring 1998.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Maximum body size and size at median maturity were greater for females than males. Skeletal muscle concentrations of the steroid hormones testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) predicted similar, but slightly smaller sizes at maturity than the morphological criterion. Stage of maturity for males was estimated identically using internal organs or external secondary sexual characters, thus allowing non-lethal maturity assessments. Size at median maturity was greater north of Point Conception for females, and north of Cape Mendocino for males. Peak parturition occurred from May to October, with increased concentrations of E2 in skeletal muscle of females correlating with ovarian recrudescence during November to February. No significant seasonal trends in female T were apparent, but mean female 11-​ketotestosteron​e (11KT) was 300% greater in April than any other month during the parturition season. There was a marginal evidence for increased number and size of ova with maternal size.

Data were generated from specimens collected by survey cruises from June 2001 through October 2004 between northern Washington to San Diego, California, U.S.A. and from known catch locations of specimens in museum collections. Longline catches consisted mainly of P. xaniurus, with occasional catch of gravid female A. brunneus. Conversely, trawl catches consisted mainly of Apristurus species. The three catshark species exhibited distinct differences in latitudinal and bathymetric range, albeit with partial overlap. Apristurus brunneus was typically found between 300 and 942 m along the entire area surveyed, while A. kampae always occurred .1,000-m depth and was not found north of 426N. Parmaturus xaniurus was caught between 300- and 550-m depth between 406N and 326N. Egg cases of A. brunneus and P. xaniurus were collected in trawl surveys and observed in video footage taken by remotely operated vehicle. These egg cases were located in specific sites on areas of high vertical relief at 300- to 500-m depth.

Total aquaculture production of 496 907 tonnes in 2008 generated USD 924 million. The mainstay of the industry is the production of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) which occurs largely in earthen ponds in the southeastern States of Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Alabama. Catfish represent 81 percent of the 287 132 tonnes of finfish produced in 2008 and 65 percent of the finfish value of USD 601 million. Catfish production increased steadily from the early 1980s reaching 300 000 tonnes in 2003, but has since declined by about 22 percent as a result of high feed costs and intense competition from imported, frozen fillet products from Asia. The culture of rainbow trout occurs throughout the country but occurs primarily in raceways in the northwestern State of Idaho. Production is relatively stable averaging about 24 000 tonnes in the decade from 1998 to 2008. Atlantic salmon is produced in ocean net pens off the northeastern coast with annual production fluctuating around 15 000 tonnes over the last decade. While, great potential exists to expand net pen culture of marine finfish, there is considerable opposition and until a supportive policy and regulatory regime are in place significant expansion of this industry sector is unlikely. Shellfish are cultured in every coastal state but three primary production centres are located along coasts of the northeastern region, the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Northwest, primarily in Washington State.

/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-wa-csv/6359955_809_2817846.csv,127,"I investigated the consumptive (CEs) and non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of a native crab predator (the red rock crab, Cancer productus) on a system of two invasive oyster drills (the Atlantic drill, Urosalpinx cinerea, and the Japanese drill, Ocinebrina inornata), a native oyster (the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida), and an introduced but commercially valuable oyster (the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas). In the presence of chemical effluent from crabs eating conspecifics, drills increased hiding behavior by 2 to 6 times, and reduced the number of oysters consumed by 50 to 67%. This is consistent with an adaptive behavioral response and has the potential to transmit large positive indirect NCEs of the crab to oysters. Neither species of drill uses a density-​dependent risk assessment, as the effect of predation effluent was similar at both high and low densities of conspecific drills. The response specificity of the Atlantic drill was further investigated to determine which cue sources (i.e., predator or prey) were eliciting these defenses. Drills responded equivalently to the consumptive predation cue (predators consuming injured conspecific prey) and injured conspecific cue alone, suggesting injured conspecifics alone are sufficient to elicit the greatest magnitude of defense. A smaller defense was elicited by cue from an unfed crab, indicating that drills have the ability to recognize a relatively novel predator. Cues of injured conspecifics and unfed predators do not have an additive effect on drill behavior. Finally, digestive byproducts, both general chemicals produced by the crab and altered cues from conspecifics, did not increase the magnitude of drills' defenses. I explored the consumptive effects of crabs on drills and oysters by estimating crab feeding rates on and preferences among all prey types. Crabs consumed both species of oyster at similar rates and did not express a preference for either oyster. However, while crabs can consume both drills and Pacific oysters at similar rates, they expressed a strong preference for Pacific oysters over either species of drill. As a result, it is likely that crabs can have strong negative consumptive effects on oysters, and that drills may be released from crab predation in oyster beds. I have identified several mechanisms which might have facilitated invasion by drills: (1) inducible defenses against a novel predator, (2) general cue recognition strategy, and (3) simultaneous introduction of prey preferred by native predators. All three mechanisms weaken the efficacy of biotic resistance. Therefore, without greater human intervention, drills will continue to pose a problem for oyster culture and restoration efforts in Washington State. Behavioral defenses and crab preferences offer drills a refuge from predation that will enable them to persist in a stable trophic chain with red rock crabs and oysters. However, if the alarm cues that trigger defenses in Atlantic drills can be identified and isolated, application to oyster beds could reduce drill predation on oysters. Taken together, these findings suggest that, in general, inducible defenses might facilitate invasion by defended prey. Further, the strong response by Atlantic drills to cues of injured conspecifics suggests a mechanism whereby these invasives, and potentially others, can recognize and respond appropriately to novel predators.

Next-generation sequencing produces large amounts of partial sequences, potentially facilitating efforts to detect signatures of selection based on comparisons between synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions, and single nucleotide polymorphism assays placed in selected genes would improve the ability to study adaptation in population surveys. However, sequences generated by these technologies are typically short. In nonmodel organisms that are a focus of evolutionary studies, the lack of a reference genome that facilitates the assembly of short sequences has limited surveys of positive selection in large numbers of genes. Here, we describe a series of steps to facilitate these surveys. We provide PERL scripts to assist data analysis, and describe the use of commonly available programs. We demonstrate these approaches in six salmon species, which have partially duplicated genomes. We recommend using multiway BLAST to optimize the number of alignments between partial coding sequences. Reading frames should be manually detected after alignment with sequences in Genbank using the BLASTX program. We encourage the use of a phylogenetic approach to separate orthologs from paralogs in duplicated genomes. Simple simulations on a gene known to have undergone selection in salmon species, transferrin, showed that the ability to detect selection in short sequences (<600 bp) depended on the proportion of codons under selection (1?2%) within that sequence.

To gain a better understanding of these processes, we exposed immature female coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to prolonged fasting to induce follicular atresia and monitored body growth, development of the ovarian follicles, changes in reproductive hormones, and transcripts for ovarian genes. Prolonged fasting reduced body and ovary weight and increased the appearance of atretic follicles relative to normally fed controls. Endocrine analyses showed that fasting reduced plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), estradiol-17b (E2), and pituitary, but not plasma, levels of follicle-​stimulating hormone (FSH). Transcripts for ovarian fsh receptor (fshr) and steroidogenesis-​related genes, such as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (star), 3b-​hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsd3b), and P450 aromatase (cyp19a1a) were significantly lower in fasted fish. Ovarian expression of apoptosis-​related genes, such as Fas-associated death domain (fadd), caspase 8 (casp8), caspase 3 (casp3), and caspase 9 (casp9) were significantly elevated in fasted fish compared to fed fish, indicating that apoptosis is involved in the process of atresia in this species. Interestingly, some genes such as fadd, casp8, casp3, and hsd3b, were differentially expressed prior to increases in the number of atretic follicles and reductions in hormone levels induced by fasting, and may therefore have potential as early indicators of atresia.

A spatial population dynamics model is used to explore effects of large, catastrophic natural mortality events. The effects of the spatial spread, magnitude, probability of catastrophe, and persistence of a catastrophic event through time are explored. Catastrophic events affecting large spatial areas and those that persist through time have the greatest effects on population dynamics because they affect natural mortality nonlinearly, whereas the probability and magnitude of catastrophic events result in only linear increases in natural mortality.

DNA samples collected from adult chum salmon from 16 streams and Chinook salmon from four streams in the Wood River system over 3 years were compared to samples from large populations in the nearby Nushagak River system, a likely source of strays. For both species, microsatellite markers indicated no significant genetic differentiation between the two systems. Simulations of microsatellite data in a large source and a smaller sink population suggested that considerable immigration would be required to counteract the diverging effects of genetic drift and produce genetic distances as small as those observed, considering the small census sizes of the two species in the Wood River system. Thus, the Wood River system likely receives substantial immigration from neighbouring watersheds, such as the Nushagak River system, which supports highly productive runs.

Conventional catch-curve methods rely on the strong assumptions of constant fishing and natural mortality rates above some fully selected age that is usually estimated by visually inspecting a plot of catch at age. Here, we evaluate the performance of three catch-curve methods that relax or modify these assumptions by (1) estimating logistic selectivity parameters, (2) assuming Lorenzen-form natural mortality (natural mortality that decreases with weight), and (3) using both methods simultaneously. We used simulation modeling and decision tables to compare estimates of fishing mortality from four catch-curve methods, including the conventional method, across a variety of observable and unobservable data characteristics​. We then applied the methods to catch-at-age data for Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus from the U.S. South Atlantic fishery management region and compared the resulting estimates with published estimates of fishing mortality (F). In our simulation modeling, catch curves that estimated logistic selectivity parameters performed better than those derived by the conventional method when logistic selectivity was present. There was generally little difference in performance between estimates assuming constant natural mortality and those assuming Lorenzen natural mortality. The improvements from estimating selectivity parameters were particularly pronounced when the sample sizes for catch-at-age data were large: in those instances, estimating selectivity improved the estimation accuracy for F by nearly 20%. In our example involving Atlantic menhaden, estimates of F assuming logistic selectivity were most similar to those of published stock assessments, which had previously estimated logistic selectivity at age. We recommend our logistic-​selectivity catch curve when selectivity is likely to be logistic because it improves accuracy at only a very small cost in terms of computational complexity.","Thorson, James T.;Prager, Michael H.",WASHU-R-11-015,WSG-TA 11-15,E/I-17,reprints (peer-reviewed),2011,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Better catch curves: incorporating age-specific natural mortality and logistic selectivity,"""Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,"" 140:356?366, 2011.",10.1080/0002848​7.2011.557016,NA,NA,NA,NA

The primary swimming characteristic influencing benthic distribution, net vertical velocity, was essentially the same for all three cell states. Hence, we found no evidence that active down-swimming influences benthic distributions.

In 1998, Paul Almeida and Linda Brewster Stearns focused their study of mercury disease victims in Minamata, Japan, to the larger political context in which LGEMs struggle, using a political opportunity framework. They found that the success of the Minamata LGEM hinged on its ability to employ non-traditional and institutionally disruptive tactics during a period of expanded political opportunities (Alemeida and Stearns, 1998). This study utilizes this framework to examine the Maury Island LGEM. Located on a small, rural island in Washington State's Puget Sound, the Maury Island LGEM developed to directly oppose the expansion of a sand and gravel mine to industrial proportions. Over the course of the thirteen-year dispute, the LGEM raised many environmental and public health concerns. The dispute was fought using a variety of tactics including litigation, lobbying, protests and demonstrations. The evolution of these tactics and the success of the LGEM over time is analyzed in this paper. Results show similarities to the Minamata case, including the benefit of exercising a variety of tactics during a period of expanded political opportunity.

While 44% of waterfront users in Puget Sound were aware of the nearby MPA, males and respondents with at least a college degree were more likely to have heard of the sites. Perceptions varied on the potential environmental impact of MPAs and whether waterfront users thought that their opinion had an impact on the MPA establishment. A dependent variable, 'perceived collaboration,' was built using resource user survey responses to measure the degree of collaboration between state agencies and the nearby community at each site. Two independent variables - a) whether resource users perceived that adequate information was used, and b) whether all views were taken into consideration ? are key factors explaining variance in perceived collaboration.

Modification of Landsburg Diversion Dam on the Cedar River, WA, USA in fall 2003 provided a unique opportunity to investigate the process of colonization as coho (O. kisutch) and Chinook (O. tshawytscha) salmon were granted access to over 33 km of spawning and rearing habitat. Adult salmon were sampled as they bypassed the dam, and total counts of both species tended to increase from 2003 to 2009, although more rapidly for coho salmon. DNA-based parentage identified salmon from the second generation of colonization as recruits if they were produced above the dam or ""strays"" if they were produced elsewhere. In 2008 and 2009, coho salmon recruits vastly outnumbered the strays, but strays were more abundant than recruits for Chinook salmon. Chinook salmon strays included a much larger proportion of hatchery origin salmon than coho salmon, despite the absence of any hatchery on the Cedar River for either species. Productivity, calculated as the ratio of recruits sampled at the dam to spawners, exceeded replacement in all four coho salmon cohorts but only one of three Chinook salmon cohorts. Parentage analysis was also used to investigate individual reproductive success and the traits of the most successful salmon. Reproductive success of male hatchery Chinook salmon was 70 ? 90 % that of natural origin fish across three cohorts, but there was no consistent trend for the females. In both sexes of coho salmon, larger fish produced more adult offspring for each of three cohorts, and early breeders produced more offspring in 2003, but not in 2004 and 2005 when fish spawning during the middle of the season were favored. In addition, there was evidence for widespread dispersal within the new habitat by stream-rearing juvenile coho salmon, most notably immigration into a tributary of the Cedar River.

This process is evaluated in two steps. First, estimates of density-​dependent catchability from single- or multispecies auxiliary models are compared, confirming that multispecies auxiliary models are more accurate when catch-at-age data are abundant. Possible output from the multispecies auxiliary assessment is then used in a focal model, and the results are compared with four other methods: (i) assuming that catchability is constant, (ii) ignoring fishery-​dependent indices, (iii) a random-walk catchability model, and (iv) estimating density-​dependent catchability without prior information. Results show that the constant catchability model leads to non-​conservative biases in stock-status estimates, and a random-walk model decreases bias and has high precision when age data are available. The auxiliary/focal procedure performs best when fishery indices are used without age data, and the density-​dependent model without prior information performs well with fishery and survey indices, but without age data.

In this issue, organisms with reference genomes are considered to be 'model'; 'nonmodel' organisms are those whose genomes are yet to be sequenced. Advances in DNA sequencing and SNP genotyping have provided profound insights into the genetics of model organisms, but until recently, studies of nonmodel species lagged behind because of the scarcity of sequence and markers (see Fig. 1). In the past year, Tautz et al. (2010) and associated papers in supplemental issue of Molecular Ecology described a revolutionary transition from studies of 'molecular ecology' to studies of 'ecological genomics'. Concurrently, Allendorf et al. (2010) grappled with placing the new-found wealth of sequence and SNP information into a 'conservation genomics' context. This revolution in molecular genetics studies would have been difficult to forecast a few years ago. Molecular genetic studies provide exceptional insight into relationships, migration and evolution of natural populations (Morin et al. 2004). During the origins of molecular ecology, in the 1960s and 1970s, it became clear that techniques such as allozyme electrophoresis would provide a basic framework for understanding species interactions and adaptation and for conserving natural genetic variability (Utter et al. 1966, 1974; Avise et al. 1975). Technical limitations at the time restricted both the ability to explore the dynamics of genetic diversity in species exhibiting low levels of variation as well as the direct analysis of adaptive variation in the wild. During the following years, innovators began to dream of potential applications for conservation and management of economically exploited species that included using molecular markers to determine the population- of-origin of migrating animals (see papers in Ryman & Utter 1987; Waples & Aebersold 1990), an important focus of many papers in this issue. Recent decades were punctuated by improvements in molecular and statistical techniques that produced an array of tools relevant to ecological and evolutionary studies such as assignment tests, estimates of effective population size, fine-scale population structure, kinship analyses (e.g. Helyar et al. this issue; Waples & Waples this issue) and genome-wide surveys based upon an ever increasing resolution of individuals and populations. The advantages of genotyping polymorphic SNPs with high-throughput assays have created much interest (Vignal et al. 2002; Brumfield et al. 2003; Morin et al. 2004; Schlo"" tterer 2004). Until recently, however, the scarcity of available DNA sequence data for nonmodel species limited marker development. Further, because of comparatively low mutation rates, cross-species amplification of primers for SNP analyses did not yield the same results as for microsatellites​. For example, Miller et al. (2010) tested the OvineSNP50 BeadChip, developed for domestic sheep, in two related ungulates and found only about 1% of the nearly 50 000 SNP loci to be polymorphic. Therefore, the SNP assays or probes developed for one species were not likely to be useful in others, even though primers may cross-amplify. The current supplemental issue contains 22 papers that underline the advantages of SNPs, advocate the need for SNP research in nonmodel organisms, and chart advances in discovery and applications. Although progress is apparent across a broad array of taxa, most papers presented here focus upon species of fish. This outcome, beyond the bias of the workshop organizers, may be in part because of the well-developed multinational collaborations that coordinate the sharing of DNA data on migratory species (Seeb et al. 2007; Martinsohn & Ogden 2009) as well as the economic and cultural importance of some of these species that fuels research efforts.",NA,WASHU-R-11-001,WSG-TA 11-26,R/LME-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2011,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Single-​nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discover and applications of SNP genotyping in nonmodel organisms,"""Molecular Ecology Resources,"" 11(supp 1):1 - 8, March 2011.",10.1111/j.1755-​0998.2010.02979​.x,http://onlineli​brary.wiley.com​/doi/10.1111/me​n.2011.11.issue​-​s1/issuetoc,NA,"Seeb, J.

This structuring occurs in two stages. The extent of habitat and resources used by a species is first defined by the threshold abiotic conditions a species may tolerate-the fundamental niche, and then is further limited by interspecific interactions to habitats and resources a species is well-adapted to use relative to other members of the community-the realized niche. For stream-rearing salmonids, a group of closely-related fishes with a circumpolar native distribution in freshwater habitats of the northern hemisphere, structuring of ecological communities is typically determined by the available regional species pool and the habitat requirements of individual species. Species then employ niche partitioning mechanisms which may reduce negative ecological interactions such as competition and interspecific hybridization. In coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest from northern California to southeast Alaska, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), coastal cutthroat trout (O. clarkii clarkii), and steelhead (anadromous rainbow trout-O. mykiss) are the most common group of native, stream-rearing salmonids. Similarities between species result in substantial overlap in physical habitat and biotic resource use. The extent of habitat and resource partitioning between species is likely to affect competition, which may occur between all three species, and interspecific hybridization, which occurs between coastal cutthroat and steelhead, although these processes are not well understood. This thesis consists of two chapters which examine how abiotic and biotic factors affect the ecology of coastal cutthroat trout and their interactions with steelhead and coho salmon. The first chapter examined the extent of spawning habitat segregation between cutthroat trout and steelhead, and its potential for limiting hybridization between the two species. This project used spatially explicit and continuous sampling of trout populations throughout a watershed in conjunction with molecular genetics to improve upon previous research, much of which has been limited by spatial scale or inability to accurately differentiate between steelhead, cutthroat and hybrids. Results of this project increase knowledge of the mechanisms allowing for continued species integrity in coastal cutthroat and steelhead, despite the viability of hybrids. The second chapter employed mark-recapture techniques to study cutthroat trout ecology during rapid colonization and population growth of sympatric coho salmon, re-colonizing part of their native range after a century of exclusion. The influence of physical habitat quality, temporal environmental variation, and coho salmon density were tested as potential factors explaining variability in cutthroat trout growth, movement and survival.

In Puget Sound, several salmon populations have experienced recent declines, including Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed Chinook salmon, which are predominately ocean-type and rear extensively in Puget Sound. Between 2001-2007, we sampled nearshore and offshore habitats of Puget Sound to determine the distribution, feeding, growth, and sources of mortality for juvenile Chinook salmon and investigated whether there was evidence for size-selective predation and for environmentally-​mediated or competition-​based reduction in growth rates that could be linked to overall marine survival trends. In the spring, juvenile salmon represented greater than 50% of the diet of cutthroat trout at nearshore habitats. Although predation by cutthroat trout was likely responsible for a relatively minor amount of the early marine mortality experienced by Chinook salmon, predation pressure was highest on the smallest fish. Assuming other fish predators exhibited similar size-selective predation, this suggested a survival advantage for larger and faster growing fish. Juvenile Chinook salmon initially occupied nearshore habitats (April-June), shifting offshore during July-September. Insects and amphipods were dominant nearshore prey sources, whereas crab larvae and fish were more important in offshore diets. Marine survival rates of Puget Sound Chinook salmon were strongly related to the average offshore body mass in July, with larger sizes associated with higher survivals. Using a bioenergetics model, we found that early marine growth of Chinook salmon was most strongly linked to feeding rates, and less to diet composition and temperature. Spring growth of juvenile Chinook salmon appeared to be food-limited in some years, and low feeding rates corresponded to poor marine survival. In conclusion, we found that Chinook salmon must feed and grow at high rates during May-July of their first marine year to increase overall marine survival. Our findings highlight the importance of local feeding conditions in Puget Sound during spring and summer, and suggest that declines in marine survival since the 1980's may have been caused by reductions in food availability for Chinook salmon during early marine life.","Duffy, Elisabeth T.",WASHU-X-09-003,WSG-TH 09-07,R/ES-44,theses/disserta​tions,2009,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Factors during early marine life that affect smolt-to-adult survival of ocean-type Puget Sound Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we have detected surprising physiological complexity in singlespecies biofilms, which is typically indicative of multispecies biofilm communities. Multiple cell morphologies were visible within the biofilms by transmission electron microscopy, and some cells contained intracellular membranes that may facilitate methane oxidation. Both methane production and oxidation were detected at 70 to 80�C and pH 9 to 10 in samples containing the single-species biofilms. Both processes were stimulated by the presence of hydrogen (H2), indicating that methane production and oxidation are part of a syntrophic interaction. Metagenomic data included a sequence encoding AMP-forming acetyl coenzyme A synthetase, indicating that acetate may play a role in the methane-cycling syntrophy. A wide range of nitrogen fixation genes were also identified, many of which were likely acquired via lateral gene transfer (LGT). Our results indicate that cells within these single-species biofilms may have differentiated into multiple physiological roles to form multicellular communities linked by metabolic interactions and LGT.

Although state-space models have been used to analyze time series for some time, only recently have the e↵ects of integrating multiple observations within a time step been explored. Collecting replicated samples within a time step may allow for more accurate and precise estimates of the non-process variance, therefore leading to more accurate estimates of the parameters governing the underlying ecological process, which is generally what ecologists are concerned with. In this dissertation, I adapt a log-linear state-space model that incorporates multiple observations at each time step to three di↵erent contexts. In the first chapter I examine the tradeo↵s between the length of a time series and the number of total observations and the e↵ect of that data structure on the precision of estimating the probability of quasi-​extinction in a population viability analysis (PVA). The results of this simulation study demonstrate that for species with relatively high process variance, a monitoring program that takes multiple observations during each time step will generate more precise estimates of the probability of quasi-​extinction compared to a program that takes only a single observation each time step. These results can be used to efficiently design e↵ective monitoring schemes for species of conservation concern. In the second chapter, I analyze the e↵ect of habitat alteration, specifically the conversion of sagebrush to agricultural land, on the population dynamics of twelve bird species in the Great Basin of the intermountain west, using multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models. All twelve species show strong support for equivalent growth rates between sagebrush and agricultural habitat, but a number also have support for unequal growth rates. Three of the four species most associated with sagebrush habitat show a noteworthy risk of decline, which contrasts with the population trend estimated as part of the standard breeding bird analysis. In the third chapter, I develop a state-space model for standardizing catch-​per-​unit-​e↵ort (CPUE) data into an index of abundance, while accounting for various covariates such as depth, gear type and fishing area. I compare the state-space model with a more standard delta lognormal model by applying them both to the wintery fishery for petrale sole o↵ the Washington and Oregon coast.

In response to this risk, a campaign was developed to inform campers in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho about the risk of invasive species being transported through firewood. There are two main objectives of this research study. The first objective is to measure the effectiveness of this campaign in informing campers about the risk of invasive species moving through firewood. The second objective is to conduct an audience analysis of Pacific Northwest campers to identify key characteristics of campers and develop a mental model of their views, knowledge, and beliefs regarding invasive species and firewood that may be used to guide future risk communication tailored to campers needs and perceptions.

Combined, these data sets are allowing us to examine relationships between fish mortality, parasite density, parasite genotype, water temperature and flow. Additionally, monitoring opportunities such as a planned pulsed flow event have allowed us to test hypotheses about the critical habitat for the parasite's invertebrate host, the polychaete Manayunkia speciosa, and to begin to develop a hydrologic model that will ultimately provide information on the timing and magnitude of flow events necessary to disturb this habitat and decrease abundance of this host.","Bartholomew, Jerri",ORESU-WR-11-044,ORESU-WR-11-044,R/RCF-15;R/RCF-19;R/RCF-24,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2011,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,Ecology of Ceratomyxosis in the Klamath River,"""AFS 141st Annual Meeting,"" Seattle, Washington, September 4-8, 2011.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specific objectives include: 1) to describe seasonal juvenile coho salmon movement patterns in a coastal basin; 2) to estimate the prevalence of each movement type; 3) to evaluate whether size and growth are related to movement strategy; 4) to evaluate whether apparent survival is affected by movement strategy type; and 5) examine the relationship between apparent survival and stream habitat variables. Results of the first year of research reveal clear differences in movement patterns exhibited by juvenile coho salmon inhabiting estuarine, tidally affected and riverine habitats. Juvenile coho salmon with mobile strategies were larger and grew faster than sedentary individuals. Apparent survival to smolting was greater among coho sedentary during summer than those that were mobile, but was similar between coho exhibiting mobile and sedentary behavior during winter.

Recently there have been calls for increased effectiveness monitoring of aquatic organism passage restoration, and a workshop was held in March 2010 to discuss the merits of four approaches: individual movement, abundance, molecular genetic markers, and occupancy models. We discuss merits and limitations of each of these methods in relation to the diverse species, natural settings where passage is restored, study designs, and logistical considerations. Together these considerations can be applied to develop a set of guidelines for monitoring the effectiveness of passage restoration for aquatic organisms.","Dunham, Jason;Hoffman, Robert;Hansen, Bruce;Giannico, Guillermo",ORESU-WR-11-047,ORESU-WR-11-047,A/ESG-07,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2011,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,Aquatic organism passage and road-stream crossings: synthesis and guidelines for development of effectiveness monitoring,"""Afs 141st Annual Meeting,"" Seattle, Washington, September 4-8, 2011.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The sustainability revolution ensures that fisheries and supporting ecosystems are conserved so that future generations can access healthy fishery resources. The second revolution creates institutions in the form of economic incentives and privileges that are necessary for achieving sustainability. But a third less heralded fishery revolution is gaining importance and recognition for its role in supporting the first two revolutions - (near) real time information systems. Modern information technologies including hardware, software, and communication infrastructure are being designed and employed to collect, share and transform real time data into near real time knowledge vital for sustaining fisheries and improving economic benefits. These electronic information systems include logbooks, fish tickets, observer and vessel monitoring systems, catch and quota reporting, research and monitoring, and market traceability. They are being employed by managers, industries, fleets, and fishermen to manage harvests and reduce bycatch and discards, track environmental conditions, improve stock assessments, coordinate fleet behavior, and increase market benefits. However, there are complex institutional, technological, and management challenges in developing and designing efficient systems.

Of the various congeners, BDE 49 (2,2′,4,5′-​tetrabromodiphe​nyl ether) has been poorly studied, despite the fact that it is often detected in the tissues of fish and wildlife species. Furthermore, we have previously shown that BDE 49 is a metabolic debromination product of BDE 99 hepatic metabolism in salmon, carp and trout, underscoring the need for a better understanding of biological effects. In the current study, we investigated the developmental toxicity of BDE 49 using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo larval model. Embryo and larval zebrafish were exposed to BDE 49 at either 5 hours post fertilization (hpf) or 24 hpf and monitored for developmental and neurotoxicity. Exposure to BDE 49 at concentrations of 4iμ-32 μM caused a dose-dependent loss in survivorship at 6 days post fertilization (dpf). Morphological impairments were observed prior to the onset of mortality, the most striking of which included severe dorsal curvatures of the tail. The incidence of dorsal tail curvatures was dose and time dependent. Exposure to BDE 49 caused cardiac toxicity as evidenced by a significant reduction in zebrafish heart rates at 6 dpf but not earlier, suggesting that cardiac toxicity was non-specific and associated with physiological stress. Neurobehavioral injury from BDE 49 was evidenced by an impairment of touch-escape responses observed at 5 dpf. Our results indicate that BDE 49 is a developmental toxicant in larval zebrafish that can cause morphological abnormalities and adversely affect neurobehavior. The observed toxicities from BDE 49 were similar in scope to those previously reported for the more common tetrabrominated congener, BDE 47, and also for other lower brominated PBDEs, suggest that these compounds may share similarities in risk to aquatic species.","McClain, Valerie;Stapleton, Heather;Tilton, Fred;Gallagher, Evan",WASHU-R-12-005,WSG-TA 12-07,R/OCEH-5,reprints (peer-reviewed),2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,BDE 49 and developmental toxicity in zebrafish,"""Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Part C,"" 155(2):253-258, March 2012.",10.1016/j.cbpc.​2011.09.004,NA,NA,NA,NA

We argue that the use of sparse assessments to evaluate fishery status requires model-based inference because assessment availability varies spatially and temporally, and we derive a model that extrapolates from assessment results to available landings, life history, and location data. This model uses logistic regression to classify stocks into different prediction bins and estimates the probability of collapse in each using cross-​validation. Results show that landings, life history, and location are informative to discriminate among different probabilities of collapse. We find little evidence that regions with fewer assessments have a greater proportion of collapsed stocks, while acknowledging weak inferential support regarding regions with one or fewer assessments. Our extrapolation suggests that 4.5%-6.5% of stocks defined by landings data are collapsed, but that this proportion is increasing.

Transmission electron microscopy confirmed OsHV-1 infection; herpesvirus-​like nucleocapsids, capsids, and extracellular particles were visualized. We demonstrated the ability to transmit OsHV-1 from infected juvenile oysters to na�ve larvae, which indicates the spread of OsHV-1 between infected hosts in the field and between commercial farms is possible. We also developed an important tool (OsHV-1- specific RT-qPCR for an active virus gene) for use in monitoring for active virus in the field and in laboratory based transmission experiments.","Burge, Colleen A.;Friedman, Colleen S.",WASHU-R-12-007,WSG-TA 12-09,R/F-157,reprints (peer-reviewed),2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Quantifying Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV-1) genome copies and expression during transmission,"""Microbial Ecology,"" 63(3):596-604, 2012.",10.1007/s00248-​011-​9937-​1,NA,NA,NA,NA

Populations at low densities may offer an unobstructed view of basic environmental and physiological interactions that impact individual fitness and thus population productivity. The energy reserves of an organism are reflected in its body condition, a measure linking individual fitness and the environment. From 1997 to 2007, we monitored the critically endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) population on its primary summer feeding ground off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia. This effort resulted in a large data set of photo-​identification images from 5,007 sightings of 168 individual whales that we used to visually assess western gray whale body condition. We quantified temporal variation in the resulting 1,539 monthly body condition determinations with respect to observations of reproductive status and sex. Western gray whale body condition varied annually, and we identified years of significantly better (2004) and worse (1999, 2006, and 2007) body condition. This study is the 1st to track the within-season body condition of individual whales. Body condition improved significantly as the summer progressed, although results suggest that not all whales replenish their energy stores by the end of the season. The body condition of lactating females was significantly worse than that of other whales at all times and was most often determined to be compromised. The body condition of their weaning calves exhibited no temporal variation and was consistently good. It is possible lactating females provide an energetic buffer to their offspring at the expense of their own body condition and future reproductive success. Findings from the analysis establish a foundation for quantifying links between western gray whale body condition, demographic parameters, and environmental conditions; and provide a baseline for monitoring individual and population condition of an ecosystem sentinel species in a changing environment. Overall, this study highlights the presence of density-​independent environmental and physiological mechanisms that affect the abundance and growth of populations.","Bradford, Amanda L.;Weller, David W.;Punt, Andre E.;Ivashchenko, Yulia V.;Burdin, Alexander M.;Vanblaricom, Glenn R.;Brownell, Robert L.

To quantify OsHV viral loads in mollusc tissues, we developed a SYBR(r) Green quantitative PCR (qPCR) based on the A-region of the OsHV-1 genome. Reaction efficiency and precision were demonstrated using a plasmid standard curve. The analytical sensitivity is 1 copy per reaction. We collected Crassostrea gigas, C. sikamea, C. virginica, Ostrea edulis, O. lurida, Mytilus galloprovincial​is, and Venerupis phillipinarum from Tomales Bay (TB), and C. gigas from Drakes Estero (DE), California, USA, and initially used conventional PCR (cPCR) to test for presence of OsHV DNA. Subsequently, viral loads were quantified in selected samples of all tested bivalves except O. lurida. Copy numbers were low in each species tested but were significantly greater in C. gigas (p < 0.0001) compared to all other species, suggesting a higher level of infection. OsHV DNA was detected with cPCR and/or qPCR and confirmed by sequencing in C. gigas, C. sikamea, C. virginica, O. edulis, M. galloprovincial​is, and V. phillipinarum from TB and C. gigas from DE. These data indicate that multiple bivalve species may act as reservoirs for OsHV in TB.

Current anthropogenic threats and environmental conditions may be limiting western gray whale recovery, warranting an examination of the magnitude and influence of these factors. Estimates of demographic parameters are also needed to characterize the population and quantify its status. Western gray whales have been monitored since 1997 on their primary feeding ground off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia. This effort resulted in a large dataset of photo-​identification images of 169 individual whales that was used to quantify anthropogenic scarring, visually assess body condition, and estimate mark-recapture and other population parameters of western gray whales. In total, 24.3% (n=41) of identified individuals were determined to have been previously entangled in fishing gear at least once and 1.8% (n=3) were found to have survived at least one vessel collision. Body condition improved significantly as each feeding season progressed, but years of significantly better and worse body condition were identified. The body condition of lactating females was significantly worse than that of other whales at all times, but the body condition of their weaning calves exhibited no temporal variation and was consistently good. A significant male-bias in the calf sex ratio could not be linked to observations of maternal condition and other reproductive characteristics​, but differential pre- or postnatal mortality of female calves could account for the sex ratio bias and lack of explanatory power. The first observed values of western gray whale age at first reproduction are seven and 11 years. Non-calf survival did not differ between males and females and was estimated as 0.973 (SE=0.007, 95% CI=0.954-​0.984), with calf survival significantly lower at 0.717 (SE=0.063, 95% CI=0.579-​0.824). Abundance estimates revealed that a maximum of 140 whales were associated with the Sakhalin feeding area by 2007. Recent movements of some Sakhalin individuals into the eastern Pacific suggest that this value may overestimate the number of gray whales that migrate and breed in Asian waters. That is, the critically endangered western gray whale population may be even smaller than presently recognized.","Bradford, Amanda L.",WASHU-X-11-005,WSG-TH 11-09,E/I-13,theses/disserta​tions,2011,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Population characteristics of the critically endangered western gray whale,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This dissertation focuses on these issues in the context of estimating sustainable quotas for aboriginal subsistence hunting of marine mammals. Bayesian model averaging was used to take into account both parameter and model uncertainty in the assessment of the Bering-​Chukchi-​Beaufort Seas (BCB) stock of bowhead whales. The lower 5th percentile of the Bayesian model-averaged posterior for an aboriginal whaling catch quantity ( 1 1 Q + ) was estimated to be 155 whales in 2002. This estimate provides confirmatory evidence that current catch quotas for this stock are sustainable. In order to assess the robustness of Bayesian assessments to alternative methods for constructing a joint prior distribution which respects biological realism, sensitivity analyses were performed in the context of a risk assessment. The probability of meeting a management objective for aboriginal subsistence hunting was found to be robust for the data-rich BCB bowhead example. However, the data-poor East Greenland walrus example was shown to be sensitive to this issue. A framework was developed and applied to the assessment of the eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales which incorporated environmental stochasticity by estimating the relationship between residuals in birth and survival rates to an environmental time series. The scenarios which accounted for the effect of the mortality event in 1999 and 2000 led to less optimistic estimates of population status during recent decades with concomitant recovery generally attributable to higher survival rates as opposed to higher birth rates. This framework was then used as an operating model conditioned on forecasts of sea-ice, which has been hypothesized to regulate recent calf production in the population. Future population trajectories were then used to test the performance of the current catch control rule for this stock. Performance was measured by the ability to satisfy different levels of future aboriginal subsistence need, and was shown to be satisfactory under the range of trials examined here. The methods developed in this dissertation are generally applicable for providing management advice for exploited populations of marine mammals and other renewable natural resources.","Brandon, John Robert",WASHU-X-09-004,WSG-TH 09-08,E/I-10,theses/disserta​tions,2009,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Quantifying uncertainty and incorporating environmental stochasticity in stock assessments of marine mammals,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We constructed a 2-stage model that first estimated the mean (μ) and variance (v) in reproductive success from published studies on salmonid fishes and then sampled offspring from reproductive success distributions simulated from the μ and v estimates. Results provided strong support for modeling salmonid reproductive success via the negative binomial distribution and suggested that few offspring samples are needed to reject the null hypothesis of uniform offspring production. However, the sampled reproductive success distributions deviated significantly (χ2 goodness-of-fit test p value <0.05) from the known simulated reproductive success distribution at rates often>0.05 and as high as 0.24, even when hundreds of offspring were assigned parentage. In general, reproductive success patterns were less accurate when offspring were sampled from cohorts with larger numbers of parents and greater variance in reproductive success.

Daily vertical migrations from 250 m or more during the day to the surface at night expose these squid to a wide range of pressure, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentration. Life history and behavioral characteristics of the Humboldt squid have likely facilitated its range expansion into the northern California Current System. After an initial presence during the 1997/1998 El Ni�o, Humboldt squid were observed in variable numbers from 2002-2010. Seasonal feeding migrations likely bring them to the productive waters off the coast of Washington and British Columbia to forage before returning to warmer waters to spawn. I investigated the behavior and habitat of Humboldt squid in situ with both electronic tags deployed on individual animals and observations collected by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) in Monterey Bay that recorded thousands of Humboldt squid from 1997-2010. With the tag data I estimated that this species can sustain horizontal velocities of > 35 km/day for over two weeks, with maximum velocities > 50 km/day. Several tagged squid dove to depths > 1.25 km, through the core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), which I interpret as predator avoidance. Vertical depths of Humboldt squid as observed with ROVs are deeper than those sampled by tagged squid, and I propose this difference is due to the habitat in which both groups were sampled. Further, I integrated observations of Humboldt squid on each ROV dive with information on time-at-depth of the ROV, creating an ""encounter rate"" metric that can be used in ecosystem and fisheries models, similar to catch per unit effort (CPUE). I used this metric to investigate the seasonality of Humboldt squid presence in the Monterey Bay area in relation to upwelling and found that early evolution of the upwelling season may serve as an indicator for the annual magnitude of their presence.

On the beneficial side, shoreline armoring continues to save millions of dollars of valuable waterfront real estate preserving valuable upland by reducing direct exposure to damaging coastal storm waves and flooding (Fig 1). Shoreline stabilization can also help waterfront property owners protect the sales value of individual properties. The financial benefits of maintaining the value of waterfront construction as a result of shoreline armoring, however, appear to remain only with the waterfront dwellings or dwellings within very close proximately of the shore. Property values only several rows inland lowers with the on-going effects of shoreline armoring, and even waterfront property values decline as more and more waterfront property owners rely on shoreline stabilization/a​rmoring (Kriesel & Friedman, 2003). On the adverse side, shoreline armoring along eroding shores continues to be responsible for the reduction in the beneficial functions and sometimes complete loss of valuable coastal resources, such as beaches, dunes, and intertidal areas. This results in the loss or alteration of associated marine habitat. Lateral beach access can also be restricted or completely lost. These impacts, particularly the loss of sandy beaches, have great relevance in states such as Hawaii where the public has the right of use of all beaches statewide. Hawaii's beaches are the backbone of a $13 billion dollar visitor economy providing approximately 171,900 jobs: the bulk of the state's jobs and income.

Nonnative species richness (NNSR), a common measure of ecosystem invasibility, varies widely among systems and is regulated by human activity and ecosystem characteristics such as habitat heterogeneity and climate. Patterns of NNSR may be confounded by variation in research effort, defined as the effort made to identify and catalogue invasions, and colonization pressure, defined as the number of species introduced. To explain spatial variation in ecosystem invasibility by fishes in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, we explored relationships among watershed characteristics​, colonization pressure, research effort, and NNSR. Colonization pressure, research effort, and range in elevation were most predictive of differences in NNSR among river basins. Montane watersheds had greater NNSR, probably because of greater habitat heterogeneity due in part to human activity; widespread impoundments here created novel lentic habitats, while lotic environments were maintained elsewhere in these watersheds. Our results illustrate the importance of examining invasion patterns of specific taxa, within regions delineated by ecologically relevant criteria. Fish invasions in the Mid-Atlantic region seem to be regulated by different factors than in other regions of North America, demonstrating that invasive species management plans need to account for geographic variation among ecosystems. In the Mid-Atlantic region, reduction of novel, artificial environmental conditions (e.g., impoundments) in montane watersheds may reduce the invasibility of these ecosystems by generalist fish invaders.","Lapointe, Nicolas W.

The bioavailability of organic matter during these rapid loading events increases, suggesting that storms play a relevant role in the mobilization of potentially labile terrestrial carbon. A high correlation between river discharge rates and dissolved and particulate nutrient and carbon concentrations during autumn and winter storms was observed in several temperate Pacific Northwest rivers. Dissolved and particulate lignin concentrations also increased with river discharge; for example, in October 2009 dissolved lignin concentrations increased roughly 240% with a 200% increase in river discharge. During these storms a unique phenolic composition was observed for dissolved lignin that was rapidly mobilized from surface soils relative to the base flow of dissolved lignin. The observed increase in Ad/Al ratios with discharge indicates that rapidly mobilized dissolved lignin is more degraded than the base flow of dissolved lignin. Similarly, a marked increase in C/V ratios and decrease in the S/V ratio of dissolved lignin phenols with increasing river discharge was observed. These results may indicate a difference in source between mobilized and base flow pools, or, more likely, preferential degradation and mobilization/re​tention of specific lignin phenols. The cumulative results from this year-long data set indicate that a shallow nutrient-rich pool of particulate and dissolved organic matter accumulates in watersheds during periods of soil-saturation deficiency (summer). Autumn and winter storms mobilize this pool of accumulated nutrients from surface soils, which is exhausted with successive winter storms.","Ward, Nicholas;Richey, Jeffrey;Keil, Richard",WASHU-R-12-010,WSG-TA 12-04,R/OLWC-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Temporal variation in river nutrient and dissolved lignin phenol concentrations and the impact of storm events on nutrient loading to Hood Canal, Washington, USA","""Biogeochemistr​y,"" 111(1-​3):629-​645, November 2012.",10.1007/s10533-​012-​9700-​9,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many statistical approaches can incorporate genotyping errors, but usually need accurate estimates of error rates. Here, we used a new microsatellite data set developed for brown rockfish (Sebastes auriculatus) to estimate genotyping error using three approaches: (i) repeat genotyping 5% of samples, (ii) comparing unintentionally recaptured individuals and (iii) Mendelian inheritance error checking for known parent-​offspring pairs. In each data set, we quantified genotyping error rate per allele due to allele drop-out and false alleles. Genotyping error rate per locus revealed an average overall genotyping error rate by direct count of 0.3%, 1.5% and 1.7% (0.002, 0.007 and 0.008 per allele error rate) from replicate genotypes, known parent-​offspring pairs and unintentionally recaptured individuals, respectively. By direct-count error estimates, the recapture and known parent-​offspring data sets revealed an error rate four times greater than estimated using repeat genotypes. There was no evidence of correlation between error rates and locus variability for all three data sets, and errors appeared to occur randomly over loci in the repeat genotypes, but not in recaptures and parent-​offspring comparisons. Furthermore, there was no correlation in locus-specific error rates between any two of the three data sets. Our data suggest that repeat genotyping may underestimate true error rates and may not estimate locus-specific error rates accurately. We therefore suggest using methods for error estimation that correspond to the overall aim of the study (e.g. known parent-​offspring comparisons in parentage studies).","Hess, Maureen;Rhydderch, James;LeClair, Larry;Buckley, Raymond;Kawase, Mitsuhiro;Hauser, Lorenz",WASHU-R-12-012,WSG-TA 12-12,R/F-161,reprints (peer-reviewed),2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Estimation of genotyping error rate from repeat genotyping, unintentional recaptures and known parent-​offspring comparisons in 16 microsatellite loci for brown rockfish","""Molecular Ecology Resources,"" 12(6):1114-​1123, November 2012.",10.1111/1755-​0998.12002,NA,NA,NA,NA

Composed of young oceanic crust formed at the Juan de Fuca Ridge, igneous rocks underlying the basin are partially insulated from cooling of their initial heat of formation by a thick layer of pelagic and turbidite sediments derived from the adjacent North American margin. The igneous seafloor is eventually consumed at the Cascadia subduction zone, where interactions between the approaching oceanic crust and the North American continental margin are partially controlled by the thermal environment. Within Cascadia Basin, basement topographic relief varies dramatically, and sediments have a wide range of thickness and physical properties. This variation produces regional differences in heat flow and basement temperatures for seafloor even of similar age. Previous studies proposed a north-south thermal gradient within Cascadia Basin, with high geothermal flux and crustal temperatures measured in the heavily sedimented northern portion near Vancouver Island and lower than average heat flux and basement temperatures predicted for the central and southern portions of the basin. If confirmed, this prediction has implications for processes associated with the Cascadia subduction zone, including the location of the ""locked zone"" of the megathrust fault. Although existing archival geophysical data in the central and southern basin are sparse, nonuniformly distributed, and derived from a wide range of historical sources, a substantial N-S geothermal gradient appears to be confirmed by our present compilation of combined water column and heat flow measurements.","Johnson, H Paul;Hautala, Susan;Bjorklund, Tor A.",WASHU-R-12-014,WSG-TA 12-14,R/NP-6,reprints (peer-reviewed),2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,The thermal environment of Cascadia Basin,"""Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems,"" 13(7):1-14, July 10, 2012.",10.1029/2011GC0​03922,NA,NA,NA,NA

Decoupling of abundances of settlers and adults often occurs when conditions for juvenile survival are poor. For infaunal bivalves, predation can be a key process that alters the abundance or distribution of adults relative to early recruits. We examined spatial patterns of recruitment of intertidal clams along the marine-​estuarine axis in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. Abundances and species richness of clam recruits were variable in space and time, but during the period of high recruitment (summer) were equal across all sites. Juvenile and adult clams, however, were consistently rare at the inner-estuarine sites relative to the outer. We hypothesized that predation was higher at our inner sites, and manipulated predator access to newly recruited clam assemblages along the estuarine gradient. Predators > 1 cm were excluded with mesh net from intertidal PVC tubes where recruitment of clams was allowed to occur naturally, and abundances and species richness of clams were measured after one summer season. Tubes with mesh nets over the top had significantly higher overall abundances of clams than unprotected tubes after 4 months, but showed no difference in clam species richness. More strikingly, the clam assemblage at the inner-estuarine sites comprised very few individuals relative to the outer-estuarine sites, regardless of predator exclusion. Multivariate analyses showed that clam assemblages in the tubes were better explained by position along the estuarine gradient than by predator treatment. Parallel studies at these sites suggested that growth of suspension feeders is actually higher in the inner estuary. Physical gradients are much less extreme in this well-mixed fjord than in many other estuaries, but we hypothesize that physical stresses such as higher temperatures at the inner beaches in the summer may be a major contributor to juvenile mortality, decoupling recruitment from adult populations.","Dethier, Megan N.;Ruesink, Jennifer;Berry, Helen;Sprenger, Amy",WASHU-R-12-015,WSG-TA 12-15,R/ES-57,reprints (peer-reviewed),2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Decoupling of recruitment from adult clam assemblages along an estuarine shoreline,"""Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology,"" 422-423:48-54, July 2012.",10.1016/j.jembe​.2012.04.009,NA,NA,NA,NA

This challenge is particularly formidable for cetaceans, which spend the majority of their time underwater. Noninvasive physiological approaches can be especially informative in this regard. We used a combination of fecal thyroid (T3) and glucocorticoid (GC) hormone measures to assess two threats influencing the endangered southern resident killer whales (SRKW; Orcinus orca) that frequent the inland waters of British Columbia, Canada and Washington, U.S.A. Glucocorticoids increase in response to nutritional and psychological stress, whereas thyroid hormone declines in response to nutritional stress but is unaffected by psychological stress. The inadequate prey hypothesis argues that the killer whales have become prey limited due to reductions of their dominant prey, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). The vessel impact hypothesis argues that high numbers of vessels in close proximity to the whales cause disturbance via psychological stress and/or impaired foraging ability. The GC and T3 measures supported the inadequate prey hypothesis. In particular, GC concentrations were negatively correlated with short-term changes in prey availability. Whereas, T3 concentrations varied by date and year in a manner that corresponded with more long-term prey availability. Physiological correlations with prey overshadowed any impacts of vessels since GCs were lowest during the peak in vessel abundance, which also coincided with the peak in salmon availability.

In this study two long-term data sets on summer diets of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in international waters of the central North Pacific Ocean (CNP; 1991-2009) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA; 1993-2002) were evaluated to identify potential drivers of steelhead productivity in the North Pacific. Stable isotopes of steelhead muscle tissue were assessed to corroborate the results of stomach content analysis. We found the composition of steelhead diets varied by ocean age group, region, and year. In both the GOA and CNP, gonatid squid (Berryteuthis anonychus) were the most influential component of steelhead diets, leading to higher prey energy densities and stomach fullness. Stomach contents during an exceptionally warm year in the GOA and CNP (1997) were characterized by high diversity of prey with low energy density, few squid, and a large amount of potentially toxic debris (e.g., plastic). Indicators of good diets (high proportions of squid and high prey energy density) were negatively correlated with abundance of wild populations of eastern Kamchatka pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) in the CNP. In conclusion, interannual variations in climate, abundance of squid, and density-​dependent interactions with highly-abundant stocks of pink salmon were identified as potential key drivers of steelhead productivity in these ecosystems. Additional research in genetic stock identification is needed to link these potential drivers of productivity to individual populations.","Atcheson, Margaret E.;Myers, Katherine W.;Davis, Nancy D.;Mantua, Nathan J.",WASHU-R-12-018,WSG-TA 12-18,R/F-160,reprints (peer-reviewed),2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Potential trophodynamic and environmental drivers of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) productivity in the north Pacific Ocean,"""Fisheries Oceanography,"" 21(5):321-335, May 2012.",10.1111/j.1365-​2419.2012.00627​.x,NA,NA,NA,NA

We use a database of published landings data and stock assessment biomass estimates and determine that process errors predominate in this data set by fitting a state-space model to data from each stock individually. We then fit multispecies process-error models while treating SBMSY/SB0 as a random effect that varies by taxonomic order and maximum length.

Although evolutionary change is often thought to proceed slowly, the microevolutiona​ry forces of selection, gene flow, genetic drift and inbreeding can have pronounced effects on genetic variation even on short time scales. These genetic changes may then influence local adaptation and demography. The overarching aim of this dissertation was to estimate levels of gene flow and selection in wild populations, and to assess how microevolutiona​ry change might affect local adaptation and population dynamics within these populations. Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are an ideal model organism for studying natural patterns of microevolution and local adaptation. First there is high phenotypic variation within the species, and spawning fish can be sampled comprehensively by capturing adults when they return to freshwater from the ocean. Second, salmon form reproductively isolated spawning populations due to natal homing, but these populations can be genetically and demographically connected via straying. Third, salmon are of ecological and commercial interest, making our findings relevant to population management. This dissertation investigated ecology and evolution in salmon as follows. In Chapter 1, we examined patterns of genetic and phenotypic differentiation between adjacent populations of beach and stream spawning ecotypes of sockeye salmon, and assessed potential levels of gene flow between ecotypes. The objective of Chapter 2 was to determine whether small populations of Chinook and chum salmon occurring in the Wood River system are reproductively isolated, self-sustaining populations, population sinks that produce returning adults but receive immigration, or strays from other systems that do not produce returning adults. In Chapter 3 we re-constructed pedigrees for two wild populations of sockeye salmon to estimate natural selection and heritability for several phenotypic traits. For Chapter 4, we used empirical results from the first three chapters to develop a stochastic, individual-​based model that we used to study effects of gene flow and selection on local adaptation and population dynamics in interconnected salmon populations. Taken together, these studies showed how gene flow and selection affect local adaptation and demography in wild salmon populations.","Lin, Jocelyn",WASHU-Y-12-001,WSG-TH 12-01,E/I-18,theses/disserta​tions,2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Microevolution, local adaptation, and demography in wild populations of Pacific salmon",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The effects of low oxygen levels on fish and invertebrate communities, particularly during early-life history stages, however, are poorly known for this area. I investigated the effects of hypoxia on the density, community structure, vertical and horizontal distribution of fish larvae and juveniles, as well as body condition of juveniles, along the central Oregon and Washington coasts during the summers of 2008 - 2011. During this sampling period, bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) values ranged from 0.49 to 9.85 ml l-1, and the number of hypoxic (e.g., < 1.4 ml l-1) stations sampled was low compared to 2002 and 2006 (only 54 sampling stations for the ichthyoplankton study out of 493, and only 12 stations out of 90 for the benthic juvenile study). From the ichthyoplankton study, I found that the overall density of fish larvae increased as bottom-DO values increased; however, the effect on individual species density was limited. Between 44.65 oN and 46.00 oN (~Florence, OR - Astoria, OR), fish larvae altered their vertical distribution when bottom-DO was low by rising in shallower water layers.

Species composition, abundance and length had strong relationships with depth. Species abundance for English sole (< 75 mm), speckled sanddab (<100 mm) and Pacific sanddab also increased with increased bottom-DO. However, the body condition of butter sole (< 75 mm) and of large speckled sanddab (≥100 mm) increased with decreased bottom-DO. Overall my research elucidates important patterns of larval and juvenile fish distribution within the NCC during summer. In both studies I have found a limited effect of DO on abundance, distribution and community assemblages. Variables other than DO, such as depth, season and location, dominated the explained variance of the intervening multivariate and univariate analysis.

Urban impervious surfaces affect hydrological and energy balances, as well as biological composition and functioning of ecosystems. Although datasets have been produced documenting urban growth at multiple time periods in coarse intervals, there remains an unmet need for observations spanning multiple decades at high frequency. We have developed an empirical method for retrieving annual, long-term continuous fields of impervious surface cover from the Landsat archive and applied it to the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore, MD megalopolis from 1984 to 2010. Fitting and applying a single regression model over time, the method relies on a multi-annual training sample of high-resolution impervious cover layers tied to coincident intra- and inter-annual Landsat image composites. These predictor images are composited and normalized to maximize discrimination of impervious surfaces from intermittently bare agricultural fields and minimize inter-annual variation due to phenology, solar illumination, and atmospheric noise. Excluding the year 2009 due to lack of data availability resulting from nearly continual winter snow cover, the resulting dataset is a continuous-​field representation of impervious surface cover at 30-m horizontal and annual temporal resolution from 1984 to 2010. Average error was approximately +/- 6% cover, with outliers due to shadows from large buildings in winter images. The region's impervious surface cover grew from 881 to 1176 +/- 11 km2 over the 27-year span--an average annual gain of approximately 11 +/- 2 km2/year--with great variability among local municipalities in terms of rate of development.

Neither impervious surface loss nor deceleration of growth were observed in any of the cities or counties over the study span. These findings show that empirical retrieval of impervious coverage at the spatial and temporal scale of the Landsat archive is possible using dense time-stacks of calibrated Landsat images, and that long-term records such as this can provide new opportunities for analyzing land-use patterns and their underlying causes to improve understanding of socio-economic processes and human-​environment interactions.","Sexton, Joseph O.;Song, Xiao-Peng;Huang, Chengquan;Channan, Saurabh;Baker, Matthew E.;Townshend, John R.",MDU-R-13-003,UM-​SG-​RS-​2013-​03,R/UC-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,NA,Maryland Sea Grant,"Urban growth of the Washington, D.C.-Baltimore, MD metropolitan region from 1984 to 2010 by annual, Landsat-based estimates of impervious cover","""Remote Sensing of Environment,"" 129:42-53, 2013.",10.1016/j.rse.2​012.10.025,NA,NA,NA,NA

Prey preferences appear to differ by habitat, time, and size within each species. It is therefore difficult to pinpoint the most critical prey source for a species, as the dominant source typically shifts over time, size range, habitat, and often between years. We reviewed the available literature on salmon feeding habits in Puget Sound and summarized patterns in feeding by species by habitat. We also identified data gaps for additional study. Each species generally progresses from a typical nearshore diet characterized largely by epibenthic crustaceans to a typical offshore diet comprised of pelagic zooplankton. Chinook salmon feed on epibenthic gammarid amphipods and neustonic drift insects then transition to a diet based on pelagic crustacean larvae and small fish prey. Coho salmon also display a progression from epibenthic to pelagic feeding, but may depend on epibenthic prey sources to a lesser extent than other species. Chum salmon have stronger dependence on the epibenthos than the other species: they rely on gammarid amphipods and harpacticoid copepods heavily at small sizes nearshore and appear to be highly selective and size-selective for these prey. In offshore pelagic areas, chum salmon tend to feed on larvaceans and calanoid copepods. Pink salmon diets are similar to that of chum salmon, feeding epibenthically on harpacticoids and gammarids then moving offshore to feed on calanoid copepods and larvaceans. Of the species, data are most lacking for pink salmon. For all species, the pelagic feeding stage is the least well-studied. Additionally, many previous studies focused on only a relatively small near-to-shore area, which makes large-scale basin comparisons challenging. Data which integrate over habitats and capture zooplankton availability and feeding transitions are needed to fully evaluate juvenile salmonids' estuarine and early marine prey experience.","Kemp, Iris;Schmidt, Michael",WASHU-WR-12-002,WSG-PS 12-01,R/LME/PD-1,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Juvenile salmon prey in Puget Sound, WA (poster presentation)","""Marine Survival of Salmon and Steelhead in the Salish Sea, 2012 Research Planning Workshop,"" poster abstracts, pp. 6-7, Bellingham, Washington, November 5-7, 2012.",NA,NA,Juvenile salmon feeding habits in Puget Sound (poster abstract title.,NA,NA

Restoration efforts have encountered many problems, one of which is the slow growth of O. lurida. This study aims to determine the effect of photoperiod and mechanical stress, environmental factors controllable in an aquaculture setting, on O. lurida stress and growth physiology. Natural photoperiod and absence of mechanical stress were expected to elicit a greater growth response. Oysters were separated into 12-hour light:12 dark or 24-hour light photoperiod treatments followed by mechanical stress or no mechanical stress. Tissue of oysters was analyzed using quantification of genes related to stress and growth. Results of stress genes indicated 12:12 photoperiod with mechanical stress induced greater stress. Growth genes implied 24-hour photoperiod with mechanical stress induced greater growth. Findings that 24-hour light was less stressful contradicted predictions that oysters would be better suited for conditions similar to natural lighting. The longer 24-hour light treatment could signal the growing season, which generally occurs in the summer months. Indications of growth in the 24-hour with stress treatment were also of interest. The results suggest that mechanical stress may play a role in stimulating growth in oysters. During the study, no growth was actually measured meaning quantification of genes only suggests possible physiological changes.

Puget Sound is a deep fjord that connects to the North Pacific between the U.S. and Canada through the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Hypoxia (<2 mg DO l-1) and extremely low pH (<7.5) occur naturally in Puget Sound as a result of inputs of upwelled ocean water, high surface production, and restricted circulation; anthropogenic eutrophication and global climate change are increasing the severity of conditions. In Summer and late Autumn, when the seasonally lowest oxygen and pH occur, conditions are particularly stressful for many organisms, yet abundant zooplankton and fish inhabit the region. How these organisms tolerate the conditions and whether their behavior, growth, taxonomic composition, and energy flow through trophic webs are altered is a focus of our research. Here we will examine shifts in zooplankton community structure and vertical distributions in relation to oxygen and pH in the field as well as results from laboratory experiments on changes in growth and survival to begin to understand how the interacting stressors affect marine ecosystems through direct and indirect effects. Because oxygen and pH are predicted to decline throughout the North Pacific, understanding controls on zooplankton will be necessary to predict future fisheries and ecosystem status.","Keister, Julie E.;McLaskey, Anna;Raatikainen, Lisa;Winans, Amanda;Busch, Shallin;McElhany, Paul",WASHU-WR-12-003,WSG-MR 12-11,R/OCEH-10,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Oxygen and pH conditions experienced by zooplankton in a north Pacific Fjord: effects on taxonomic composition, distributions, and growth (presentation slides)","""North Pacific Marine Science Organization, PISES 2012 Annual Meeting,"" Session 14: Changing Ocean Biogeochemistry and it's Ecosystem Impacts, Hiroshima, Japan, October 12-21, 2012.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cadmium (Cd) is an olfactory toxicant that elicits cellular oxidative stress as a mechanism of toxicity while also inducing protective cellular antioxidant genes via activation of the nuclear factor (erythroid-​derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms of Cd-induced olfactory injury have not been characterized. In the present study, we investigated the role of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defense pathway in protecting against Cd-induced olfactory injury in zebrafish. A dose-dependent induction of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes associated with cellular responses to oxidative stress was observed in the olfactory system of adult zebrafish following 24 h Cd exposure. Zebrafish larvae exposed to Cd for 3 h showed increased glutathione S-transferase pi (gst pi), glutamate-​cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (gclc), heme oxygenase 1 (hmox1) and peroxiredoxin 1 (prdx1) mRNA levels indicative of Nrf2 activation, and which were blocked by morpholino-​mediated Nrf2 knockdown. The inhibition of antioxidant gene induction in Cd-exposed Nrf2 morphants was associated with disruption of olfactory driven behaviors, increased cell death and loss of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Nrf2 morphants also exhibited a downregulation of OSN-specific genes after Cd exposure. Pre-incubation of embryos with sulforaphane (SFN) partially protected against Cd-induced olfactory tissue damage. Collectively, our results indicate that oxidative stress is an important mechanism of Cd-mediated injury in the zebrafish olfactory system. Moreover, the Nrf2 pathway plays a protective role against cellular oxidative damage and is important in maintaining zebrafish olfactory function.","Wang, Lu;Gallagher, Evan",WASHU-R-13-001,WSG-TA 12-31,R/OCEH-5,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Role of Nrf2 antioxidant defense in mitigating cadmium-induced oxidative stress in the olfactory system of zebrafish,"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, 266(2):177-186, January 2013",10.1016/j.taap.​2012.11.010,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hatchery males were consistently but not significantly less productive than naturally spawned males (range in relative RS: 0.70- 0.90), but the pattern for females varied between years. The sex ratio was heavily biased toward males; therefore, inclusion of the hatchery males increased the risk of a genetic fitness cost with little demographic benefit. Measurements of natural selection indicated that larger salmon had higher RS than smaller fish.

Murres relied chiefly on Pacific herring Clupea harengus pallasi and surf smelt Hypomesus pretiosus to provision chicks, although they regularly returned 8 other fish taxa. Provisioning success was measured by the energy return rate to chicks, which in turn was disarticulated into energy per meal (quality) and meal delivery rate (quantity).

Despite the increased delivery rate, energy return rates were still lower in 'compensation' vs. 'good' years. The lowest energy return rates occurred in 3 'poor' years, during which ocean productivity was also depressed.

While crabs consumed drills and oysters at approximately the same rate when only one type of prey was offered, they expressed a strong preference for juvenile oysters over drills when they were allowed to choose among the three prey items.

A 30 arc-second resolution wave forecasting model was implemented making use of the WAVEWATCH III numerical code covering the coastal region from Klamath, CA to Taholah, WA. The wave forecasts extend to the continental shelf at this resolution. To assess the performance of the model, its output was compared against in situ data, with normalized root-​mean-​squared errors in significant wave height in the vicinity of 0.20 and linear correlation coefficients greater than 0.80. Making use of the resulting validated regional scale wave forecasting system, an evaluation of the model sensitivity to the inclusion of bottom friction and wind input at the shelf level was performed. Results suggest that neither dissipation due to bottom friction or wind generation are significant for long term forecasting/hin​dcasting in the region.

Both drills hid more often and reduced their feeding rates when they detected predators consuming conspecific prey. Examination of the responses of U. cinerea to specific cue sources (predator kairomones, conspecific alarm cues) indicated that this species had the strongest responses to cues from injured conspecifics, but that it did recognize the novel crab predator. Our observation of native predator (per se) recognition by an invasive marine prey is novel. In addition, we observed that neither species of drill reduced their defensive behavior to reflect predation risk shared by a group of prey. The lack of density dependence in risk-assessment could cause populations of invasive prey to transmit both quantitatively and qualitatively different community effects over the course of an invasion as abundance changes.

In Chapter 1, the potential use of the ratio of the density of fish outside a marine reserve to that inside the reserve in a fishery management control rule (DRCR) is evaluated by Management Strategy Evaluation. The cumulative catch under the optimal DRCR was 90% of the cumulative catch from an optimal constant effort rule (CER). A small range of parameter values for the DRCR produced 75% or more of the cumulative catch produced from optimal CERs for a variety of assumptions about biology and initial stock status. The optimal DRCR was most sensitive to movement patterns of larvae and adults and survey variability. In Chapter 2, a simulation model was used to analyze the ability of several stock assessment approaches to estimate current biomass after the implementation of a marine reserve. Results show that assessing populations as a single stock without accounting for a no-take marine reserve and performing separate assessments for fished and protected areas can lead to severely biased estimates of biomass. An assessment approach which explicitly accounted for fish movement was robust to uncertainty in movement patterns.

The other modeled hypothesis is that mothers of different ages spawned in different times or locations.

Native cultural elements permeate the film and the resource guide, and students will learn-from the tribal point of view-the importance of caring for, respecting and living in harmony with Mother Earth. For thousands of generations, the indigenous people of this land have understood that they are part of what is now commonly referred to as the ecological system. They have understood that the watersheds are our homes, and that the gifts of Nature must be respected. It is fundamental to quality education for all children to experience this wisdom, and to learn to celebrate life in all its various forms. Based on the tried and true lessons of the past, we can all take a wiser course of action in the future. Shadow of the Salmon also acknowledges the great importance of team spirit in protecting and restoring salmon and the health of our watersheds. Clearly, the path to these critical objectives is one we must travel together. Tribal and non-tribal communities must learn, work, and celebrate together.

This process, ocean acidification, is a future and contemporary concern for aquatic organisms, causing failures in Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) aquaculture. This experiment determines the effect of elevated pCO2 on the early development of C. gigas larvae from a wild Pacific Northwest population. Adults were collected from Friday Harbor, Washington, USA (48deg 31.7'N, 12deg 1.1'W) and spawned in July 2011. Larvae were exposed to Ambient (400 uatm CO2), MidCO2 (700 uatm), or HighCO2 (1,000 uatm). After 24 h, a greater proportion of larvae in the HighCO2 treatment were calcified as compared to Ambient. This unexpected observation is attributed to increased metabolic rate coupled with sufficient energy resources. Oyster larvae raised at HighCO2 showed evidence of a developmental delay by 3 days post-​fertilization, which resulted in smaller larvae that were less calcified.","Timmins-​Schiffman, Emma B.;O'Donnell, Michael J.;Friedman, Carolyn S.;Roberts, Steven B.",WASHU-R-12-024,WSG-TA 12-29,R/OCEH-4,reprints (peer-reviewed),2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Elevated pCO2 causes developmental delay in early larval Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas","""Marine Biology,"" published online [doi: 10.1007/s00227-​012-​2055-​x], October 20, 2012.",10.1007/s00227-​012-​2055-​x,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we characterized the major coho salmon olfactory GSTs (OlfGSTs), namely omega, pi, and rho subclasses. OlfGST omega contained an open reading frame of 720 bp and encoded a protein of 239 amino acids. OlfGST pi and OlfGST rho contained open reading frames of 627 and 681 nt, respectively, and encoded proteins of 208 and 226 amino acids. Whole-protein mass spectrometry yielded molecular weights of 29,950, 23,354, and 26,655 Da, respectively, for the GST omega, pi, and rho subunits. Homology modeling using four protein-​structure prediction algorithms suggest that the active sites in all three OlfGST isoforms resembled counterparts in other species. The olfactory GSTs conjugated prototypical GST substrates, but only OlfGST rho catalyzed the demethylation of the pesticide methyl parathion. OlfGST pi and rho exhibited thiol oxidoreductase activity toward 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (2-HEDS) and conjugated 4-​hydroxynonenal (HNE), a toxic aldehyde with neurodegenerati​ve properties. The kinetic parameters for OlfGST pi conjugation of HNE were KM = 0.16 +/- 0.06 mM and Vmax = 0.5 +/- 0.1 mmol min-1 mg-1, whereas OlfGST rho was more efficient at catalyzing HNE conjugation (KM = 0.022 +/- 0.008 mM and Vmax = 0.47 +/- 0.05 mmol min-1 mg-1).

High-resolution wave forecasts are useful for navigational planning, identifying wave energy resources, providing information for site-specific coastal flood models, and having an informed recreational beach user group, among other things. This forecasting model is run once a day at 1200 UTC producing 84-h forecasts. A series of nested grids with increasing resolution shoreward are implemented to achieve a 30-arc-second resolution at the shelf level. This resolution is significantly higher than what the current operational models produce, thus improving the ability to quantify the alongshore variations of wave conditions on the PNW coast. Normalized root-​mean-​squared errors in significant wave height and mean wave period range from 0.13 to 0.24 and from 0.13 to 0.26, respectively. Visualization of the forecasts is made available online and is presently being used by recreational beach users and the scientific community. A series of simulations, taking advantage of having a validated shelf-scale numerical wave model, suggests that neither dissipation due to bottom friction nor wind generation is important in the region at this scale for wave forecasting and hindcasting when considering bulk parameters as opposed to the processes of refraction and shoaling.

The states of Idaho and Washington have funded outreach and mandatory boat inspection stations; in doing so, they have intercepted trailered boats infested with aquatic invasive species, such as zebra and quagga mussels. However, Oregon courts have interpreted Oregon1s constitution to prevent state officials from conducting searches without probable cause by means of mandatory check stations in other contexts, if criminal penalties could result. This raises questions on whether voluntary boat inspections are effective and what actions must be taken to increase the effectiveness of aquatic invasive species prevention programs. Would Oregon1s constitution allow officials to operate mandatory boat inspection stations if no criminal sanctions could result? If so, what is the likely efficacy of mandatory boat inspections if only civil penalties could result? What changes to the constitution, statutes and administrative rules would need to be made to allow mandatory boat inspections for the effective control of invasive species? What combination of mandatory inspections, outreach, and voluntary actions would effectively lessen the threat and spread of aquatic invasive species?

In the natural sciences, the alternatives center on two ideas: (1) offer an ocean-titled undergraduate degree program (e.g., University of Washington, University of Miami, Texas A&M University Galveston, University of Rhode Island, University of Michigan) or (2) offer only masters and doctoral level degrees (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Oregon State University). Until 1991 the University of Hawaii (UH) system subscribed exclusively to the latter philosophy; the flagship UH-Manoa campus still offers no ocean-titled undergraduate degrees (such as marine biology, oceanography, fisheries, aquaculture, ocean engineering, marine policy, and so on). The UH-Hilo campus now offers a B.A. in marine science. Since 1971 many of the educational needs of UH undergraduates throughout the 10-campus system have been met through the Marine Option Program (MOP). In 1989 programs were introduced for graduate students as well. MOP may serve as a useful, cost effective educational model for other institutions. Responding to student demands for more relevant education in the late 1960s and early 1970s, MOP was conceived and initially implemented through the creativity and perseverance of John Craven (then UH dean of marine programs), Jack Davidson (director, UH Sea Grant College Program), and Barry Hill (a graduate student in tropical agriculture and the first director of MOP, 1971-75). MOP has evolved substantially over the years, never quite fitting any traditional pigeonhole in the university structure, but nevertheless contributing a significant element to the marine education of thousands of UH students. This is accomplished primarily through three vehicles: award of academic certificates, a vigorous experiential education activities program, and academic and career counseling and outreach. After 23 years, MOP currently employs 10 faculty (all but one contribute only part of their time to MOP), two educational specialists, a secretary, and numerous students on four campuses in the UH system (UH-Manoa, UH-Hilo, Maui Community College, Windward Community College).

The Sound is a fjord-like lowland consisting of numerous smaller estuaries. Much of it has been heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities, and two locations have been designated as federal Superfund sites. The purpose of this investigation was to survey the benthic foraminifera present in Puget Sound and relate their distribution to environmental parameters. The 64 grab samples used were provided by the Washington Department of Ecology through their annual Puget Sound Ambient Monitoring Program and span the years 1997-2010. The investigation recorded 46 species of benthic foraminifera, with four species dominating the assemblages: Eggerella advena (Cushman), Elphidiella hannai (Cushman and Grant), Elphidium excavatum (Terquem), and Bucella frigida (Cushman). Agglutinated taxa were dominant in the northern Sound and parts of the southern Sound, but nearly absent in samples from the central Sound. Density and diversity indices were extremely variable throughout the Sound, even in samples taken from the same site over a number of years. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that no single environmental parameter analyzed was responsible for the distribution of foraminifera. Cluster analysis yielded four main groups dominated by the four taxa listed above. These clusters were heterogeneous in their distribution, with samples from the same sample site grouped in different clusters in different years. The extreme heterogeneity of the results indicates the need for a series of smaller-scale investigations focusing on individual embayments to better understand the foraminiferal distributions and to develop a foraminiferal monitoring tool unique to Puget Sound.","Martin, Ruth A.;Nesbitt, Elizabeth A.;Martin, David E.",WASHU-R-13-006,WSG-TA 12-26,R/COCC-3,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Distribution of foraminifera in Puget Sound, Western Washington, U.S.A","""The Journal of Foraminiferal Research,"" 43:291-304, 2013.",10.2113/gsjfr.4​3.3.291,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we analyze fishing effort and catch data of the Taiwanese distant-water longline tuna fleet - the largest fleet in the Atlantic Ocean. These data collected by fishery observers over a 5-year span include 61 trips involving 6181 observed sets of over 20 million hooks, where 198 seabirds were caught (23 of which were released alive). Most birds were caught in the South Atlantic, with estimated seabird bycatch rates ranging from 0.026 birds per thousand hooks in the southwest Atlantic to 0.063 birds per thousand hooks in the southeast Atlantic. Black-browed, Atlantic yellow-nosed, and wandering albatrosses, as well as spectacled and southern giant petrels, were the most frequently caught species. Seabird bycatch hotspots were identified at 20�-​40�S/10�W-​15�E and 35�-​45�S/45�-​55�W. In the South Atlantic Ocean, generalized additive models indicated that fishing location and the number of birds sighted significantly influenced seabird bycatch rates. Extrapolating these spatially and temporally explicit seabird bycatch rates to the fishing effort data of other distant-water longline fleets and extrapolating the bycatch rates reported in the literature to the reported fishing effort of coastal nation fleets, we estimate the total seabird incidental mortality from pelagic longline fishing in the southern Atlantic Ocean to be between 3446 and 6083 birds per year from 2004 to 2008. These findings support proposals calling for the required use of best-practice mitigation measures by all pelagic longline vessels operating in seabird bycatch hotspots in the South Atlantic Ocean.

We also added weight to a subset of branch lines, and compared the effects of line weighting and night vs. day setting in combination with bird-scaring lines on bird and fish catch rates. White-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis)​, a diving seabird, dominated the seabird assemblage; they were the most numerous seabird and they attacked baited hooks and were killed at the highest rates. Secondary attacks - surface foraging albatrosses stealing baits from white-chinned petrels - drove albatross mortality. With hybrid scaring lines deployed, both diving and surface foraging seabirds made fewer attacks (1.5 and 2 times, respectively) within the lines' 100 m aerial extent, where hooks are closest to the surface and birds are most vulnerable to hooking, than with light lines. However, all metrics of comparison between hybrid and light lines were not statistically conclusive, primarily because birds could access baited hooks in areas beyond the protection afforded by bird-scaring lines (aft and to port of their aerial extent). Seabird bycatch rates were 4.6 times higher during daylight hours (2.00 birds/1000 hooks; 52 birds) than at night (0.439 birds/1000 hooks; 28 birds) and night catch rates near the full moon doubled. Bird catch rates were 18 times higher on unweighted branch lines (1.07/1000 hooks; 79 birds) than on weighted branch lines (0.06/1000 hooks; 1 bird) with no detectable effect on fish catch. With respect to streamer lines, our results suggest that in Procellaria petrel dominated systems the aerial extent of bird-scaring lines (of any design) should span the distance that baited hooks are within 10 m of the surface to effectively prevent bird attacks on baits. Overall, results suggest that night setting, adequate branch line weighting, and proper deployment of two bird-scaring lines have the potential to reduce seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries without reducing the catch rates of target fishes. Further development of safe, fast-sinking branch line weighting configurations and bird-scaring lines less prone to tangling on fishing gear is critical to this effort.","Melvin, Edward F.;Guy, Troy J.;Read, Lorraine B.",WASHU-R-13-007,WSG-TA 13-02,A/FP-7,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Reducing seabird bycatch in the South African joint venture tuna fishery using bird-scaring lines, branch line weighting and nighttime setting of hooks","""Fisheries Research,"" 147:72-82, 2013.",10.1016/j.fishr​es.2013.04.015,NA,NA,NA,NA

With the removal of Elwha Dam and initiation of Glines Canyon Dam's removal in fall 2011, sediment deposits will change the estuary and affect anadromous and nearshore marine fishes. Juvenile Chinook salmon commonly use estuaries and the river's population is part of an Evolutionarily Significant Unit listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. This study reports on monthly sampling in part of the river's estuary from March 2007 through September 2011 to characterize the seasonal changes in relative abundance of yearlings and sub-yearlings, and size distributions prior to dam removal. Most (69 %) of the yearlings were caught in April, when this life history type was released from the hatchery, and to a lesser extent in May (28 %) and June (3 %). Yearlings caught in the estuary were smaller than those released from the hatchery (means: 153 mm�28 SD vs. 175 mm�5 SD), suggesting more rapid departure by larger fish. Sub-yearlings were much more abundant in the estuary, and were caught from March through November, increasing in mean fork length by 8.7 mm month-1. The hatchery-origin subyearlings were not marked externally and so were not distinguishable from natural origin fish. However, 39 % of the sub-yearlings were caught prior to June, when sub-yearlings were released from the hatchery, indicating substantial use of the estuary by natural-origin fish. Thus, even in a reduced state after a century of dam operation, the highly modified estuary was used over many months by juvenile Chinook salmon. The information on juvenile Chinook salmon prior to dam removal provides a basis for comparison to patterns in the future, when the anticipated increase in estuarine complexity may further enhance habitat use by juvenile Chinook salmon.","Quinn, Thomas P.;Shaffer, J.

This increased yield of a non-native species has been supported by natural recruitment as well as some planting of small clams. Manila clam settlement was recorded over three years in clam spat collectors (mesh bags containing gravel) and occurred in June to October at water temperatures >13 deg. C. At 16 sites in the bay, clam abundance was measured at multiple life stages. Distributions of early-stage larvae during a spawning peak were well-correlated with wild populations of adult clams, with both stages highest in the southwest region having long residence time and little direct freshwater input. In contrast, settlement of these larvae 1-2 weeks later was correlated neither with early-stage larval distributions nor with one year-old recruits a year later; instead, settlement was spread more evenly between southeast and southwest regions, possibly due to mixing during larval development. Therefore, higher natural clam production in west than east may stem from differential post-settlement survival over the first winter, whereas low densities of all life stages in northern regions may be set by larval supply due to water residence time constraints. Despite an extended settlement period of several months, clams were no more abundant after one year than were measured for one week in clam spat collectors, suggesting generally high post-settlement losses in addition to factors that are spatially variable and break down correlations among life stages.","Ruesink, J.

In salmonids, growth-related traits have been shown to be related to a number of key life history traits that are important for fitness. Here, a combination of quantitative and molecular approaches were used to characterize quantitative traits involved in growth in coho salmon populations, and to examine whether adaptive processes underlying these traits have played a role in their evolution. Population divergence at quantitative traits (QST) was compared to that at neutral markers, (FST); QST values for juvenile traits exceeded FST, suggesting that selection may have driven population divergence at these traits. As a first step in identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL), sex-specific genome maps were constructed. A total of 133 microsatellite markers, 148 amplified fragment length polymorphisms and one phenotypic locus were used to detect twenty-four linkage groups spanning 287.4 cM in the male and 33 linkage groups spanning 429.7cM in the female. Fifty-three QTL for growth rate, length and weight at eight time periods were located on seven linkage groups and five QTL for growth related traits and one QTL for hatch timing were associated with six unlinked markers. Multiple QTL mapped to the same linkage group location, indicating a genetic basis for phenotypic correlations observed between many of the traits. Population genomic surveys of divergence in four wild coho populations were used in order to detect ""outlier"" loci that show evidence of adaptive divergence. Four loci linked to QTL for growth-related traits and seven anonymous loci were found to be under selection in one or more pairwise comparisons. Balancing selection tended to outweigh directional selection at the loci surveyed, although the power of the approach might have been limited by recombination between the marker and the trait locus, by time since population divergence, or by historic population sizes.

The following final report summarizes the results of the commissioned research studies, provides an overview of program activities and recommends future research and monitoring to support sustainable management of geoduck aquaculture in Washington state.",Washington Sea Grant,WASHU-T-13-002,WSG-TR 13-03,M/M-1,technical reports/surveys​/patents,2013,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Geoduck aquaculture research program.

Bellingham Bay is located northeast of the Straits of Juan de Fuca and is separated from the Straits of Georgia by the Lummi Peninsula, Portage and Lummi islands, and is bordered to the east by the city of Bellingham. Freshwater input comes primarily from the Nooksack River that originates on the volcanic peak of Mt. Baker. Sediment size is dominantly silt and clay. Benthic infaunal indices in Bellingham Bay are low, though they increase southward, and degraded sediment conditions have been recorded. Ten foraminiferal samples from a single (temporal) site, collected by the Washington Department of Ecology between 1997 and 2012, were utilized. In addition, several samples from other parts of Bellingham Bay were examined for comparison. Results from the single temporal site show extremely high foraminiferal density (as high as 6120 individuals/gra​m dry sediment) in many sites. Conversely, some of the additional samples produced no foraminifera at all, and consisted of only comminuted plant debris. Species richness varied between 1 and 12, with the highest in the inner harbor sample and lowest in the temporal sample collected in 2006. The temporal samples showed a striking trend of decreasing foraminiferal density over the time studied. Eggerella advena, a highly tolerant species known to be an opportunistic colonizer of polluted areas particularly those impacted by sewage, was the dominant species in the temporal samples; this site lies offshore the sewage treatment plant for the City of Bellingham. The proportion of E. advena in these samples decreased over time, possibly due to implementation of a comprehensive storm-water management plan beginning in 1997. The plan was updated in 2007. In 2004, the proportion of E. advena rose suddenly and then fell again in subsequent years. The fluctuations could be attributed to major storms and flooding that occurred at the end of 2003 and which overwhelmed the storm-water system and may have released sewage into the Bay.","Nesbitt, Elizabeth A.;Tomlinson, R.

Furthermore, discrepancies between mapped and actual stream length vary between watersheds, confounding efforts to understand the impacts of land use on stream ecosystems. Here we report on research that predicts stream presence from coupled field observations of headwater stream channels and terrain variables that were calculated both locally and as an average across the watershed upstream of any location on the landscape. Our approach used maximum entropy modeling (MaxEnt), a robust method commonly implemented to model species distributions that requires information only on the presence of the entity of interest. In validation, the method correctly predicts the presence of 86% of all 10-m stream segments and errors are low (<1%) for catchments larger than 10 ha. We apply this model to the entire Potomac River watershed (37,800 km2) and several adjacent watersheds to map stream density and compare our results with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). We find that NHD underestimates stream density by up to 250%, with errors being greatest in the densely urbanized cities of Washington, DC and Baltimore, MD and in regions where the NHD has never been updated from its original, coarse-grain mapping. This work is the most ambitious attempt yet to map stream networks over a large region and will have lasting implications for modeling and conservation efforts.","Elmore, Andrew J.;Julian, Jason P.;Guinn, Steven M.;Fitzpatrick, Matthew C.",MDU-R-13-008,UM-​SG-​RS-​2013-​08,R/WS-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,NA,Maryland Sea Grant,Potential stream density in Mid-Atlantic U.S. watersheds,"""PLoS One,"" 8(8):e74819, doi: 10.1371/journal​.pone.0074819, August 2013.",10.1371/journal​.pone.0074819,NA,NA,NA,NA

The waves in the U.S. Pacific Northwest have been identified as very energetic making this coast potentially suitable for wave energy harvesting. Several efforts to harvest this resource are under way in this region, however no long term, high resolution description of the resource is presently available. Here, the results of a 7 year hindcast are presented at a 30 arc-second resolution using the numerical models WAVEWATCH III and SWAN. The hindcast accuracy was quantified by comparing to measured buoy data yielding linear correlation coefficients w0.90 for the significant wave height. This study describes the alongshore variability of the resource over the continental shelf. The general decline of the wave power with depth is explained by considerations of wave refraction and shoaling. Further, due to wave refraction, areas off the central and southwest Oregon coast are identified that show increased wave power at 50 m of water in comparison with the 250 m value. These areas also show increased temporal variability. In addition, areas with preferentially narrower wave spectra in both frequency and direction are identified off southwest Oregon. Further, general trends in the directionality of the resource indicate a systematic switch in the wave direction with latitude. The seasonality of the resource is also assessed in terms of variability and trends relevant to the planning and deployment of wave energy converters. The continental shelf is mapped in terms of the coefficient of variability, which is greater (smaller) than unity during the summer (winter) and regardless of the season smaller in southwest Oregon.","Garcia-Medina, Gabriel;Ozkan-Haller, H.

However, little is known about how the shellfish industry perceives OA related obstacles and envisions adaptation. We conducted a 44-question, online survey of shellfish hatcheries and growers across Washington, Oregon, and California to better understand stakeholder's OA perspectives and experiences, and to assist in tackling this information deficit. Eighty-six stakeholders participated (46% response rate) from the oyster, clam, mussel, geoduck, and abalone industries. Participants reported their understanding of OA drivers, experience from OA impacts, level of concern, and perceived adaptability. Respondents indicated which environmental measurements and information sources inform their business practices, the usefulness of University-​based research, and their willingness to share monitoring data. Fifty-two percent of respondents indicated they have personally experienced negative impacts from OA. Participants identified the shellfish industry as the entity with highest priority for responding to OA, followed closely by science. Seventy-five percent of participants thought University-​based research is usually or extremely useful, and 90% reported they are somewhat or very willing to share data with scientists. Sixty-four percent felt the shellfish industry is definitely or somewhat able to adapt. While the shellfish industry is experiencing OA, they are committed to learning about the issue and its implications for their businesses. There is potential for partnerships and data sharing between scientists and industry, but issues of trust and uncertainty need to be addressed. Respondents from all three states expressed guarded optimism on OA adaptability. In addition, this cooperative research project with the shellfish industry has the potential to strengthen trust and advance communication between stakeholders and scientists.

Each publication focuses on one species, summarizing how it arrived in the Chesapeake region, why it is harmful to the environment, what is being done to control it, and the current status of its population. This fact sheet focuses on water chestnut (Trapa natans), an aquatic plant native to Europe. This annual herb displays a floating rosette of triangular shaped leaves surrounding a central stem that stays rooted in the sediment. It reproduces at a fast rate, producing up to 20 nuts per rosette each growing season. The plant, which grows in shallow nutrient-rich waters, was first recorded in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in 1923 on the Potomac River near Washington, D.C. By 1993, 10,000 acres of dense beds extended from D.C. to just south of Quantico, Virginia. Water chestnut has also been found in Maryland on the Bird and Sassafras rivers. The plant is harmful because it spreads quickly and forms dense, floating mats that keep sunlight from reaching native Bay grasses growing in the sediment below. It is also a physical nuisance: the plant produces seeds with pointed spines that are sharp enough to penetrate shoe leather and can impede boat navigation and other water activities. Since the 1950s and 1969s, managers have relied on mechanical removal and herbicides to control water chestnut. More recently mechanical harvesting by boat and hand removal by volunteers have been successful at reducing populations.","Allen, Jenny;Strain, Daniel",MDU-G-13-007,UM-​SG-​PI-​2013-​05,C/C-1;R/INV-23;O/M-2,"advisory/extens​ion reports; fact sheets, posters",2013,NA,Maryland Sea Grant,Aquatic invasive species in the Chesapeake Bay: water chestnut,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Within the marine-​terrestrial ecotone, upper intertidal ""wrack zones"" accumulate organic debris from algae, seagrass, and terrestrial plant sources and provide food and shelter for many organisms. Human modification also occurs within this ecotone, particularly in the form of armoring structures for bank stabilization that physically disrupt the connectivity between ecosystems. We conducted detailed wrack and log surveys in spring and fall over 3 years at 29 armored-​unarmored beach pairs in Puget Sound, WA, USA. Armoring lowered the elevation of the interface between marine and terrestrial ecosystems and narrowed the width of the intertidal transition zone. Armored beaches had substantially less wrack overall and a lower proportion of terrestrial plant material, while marine riparian zones (especially trees overhanging the beach) were an important source of wrack to unarmored beaches. Armored beaches also had far fewer logs in this transition zone. Thus, they lacked biogenic habitat provided by logs and riparian wrack as well as the organic input used by wrack consumers. Results such as these that demonstrate armoring-​associated loss of connectivity across the marine-​terrestrial ecotone may be useful in informing conservation, restoration, and management actions.","Heerhartz, Sarah M.;Dethier, Megan N.;Toft, Jason D.;Cordell, Jeffrey R.;Ogston, Andrea S.",WASHU-R-13-015,WSG-TA 13-11,R/OCEH-2,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Effects of shoreline armoring on beach wrack subsidies to the nearshore ecotone in an estuarine fjord,"""Estuaries and Coasts,"" published online doi: 10.1007/s12237-​013-​9754-​5, December 18, 2013.",10.1007/s12237-​013-​9754-​5,NA,NA,NA,NA

Physiological and behavioral traits expressed during benthic-pelagic transition potentially regulate the timing, location and persistence of blooms. The roles of key physiological and behavioral traits involved in resting cell emergence and bloom formation were examined in two geographically distinct strains of the harmful alga, Heterosigma akashiwo. Physiological measures of cell viability, division and population growth, and cell fatty acid content were made using flow cytometry and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry techniques as cells transitioned between the benthic resting stage and the vegetative pelagic stage. Video-based tracking was used to quantify cell-level swimming behaviors. Data show increased temperature and light triggered rapid emergence from the resting stage and initiated cell swimming. Algal strains varied in important physiological and behavioral traits, including survivorship during life-stage transitions, population growth rates and swimming velocities. Collectively, these traits function as ""population growth strategies"" that can influence bloom formation. Many resting cells regained the up-swimming capacity necessary to cross an environmentally relevant halocline and the ability to aggregate in near-surface waters within hours after vegetative growth supporting conditions were restored. Using a heuristic model, we illustrate how strain-specific population growth strategies can govern the timescales over which H. akashiwo blooms form.

Past single-species hypotheses examining the economic plausibility of exploiting rare species have argued that the escalating value of rarity allows extinction to be profitable. We describe an alternative pathway toward extinction in multispecies exploitation systems, termed 'opportunistic exploitation'. In this mode, highly valued species that are targeted first by fishing, hunting, and logging become rare, but their populations can decline further through opportunistic exploitation while more common but less desirable species are targeted. Effectively, expanding exploitation to more species subsidizes the eventual extinction of valuable species at low densities. Managers need to recognize conditions that permit opportunistic depletion and pass regulations to protect highly desirable species when exploitation can expand to other species.","Branch, Trevor A.;Lobo, Aaron S.;Purcell, Steven W.",WASHU-R-13-022,WSG-TA 13-13,R/COCC/SS-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Opportunistic exploitation: an overlooked pathway to extinction,"""Trends in Ecology and Evolution,"" 28:409-413, 2013.",10.1016/j.tree.​2013.03.003,NA,NA,NA,NA

Overfishing is a major problem in many fisheries, but in some regions the recent tendency has been to exploit stocks at levels below their maximum sustainable yield. In Western North American groundfish fisheries, the status of individual stocks and management systems among regions are highly variable. In this paper, we show the current status of groundfish stocks from Alaska, British Columbia, and the U.S. West Coast, and quantify the influence on stock status of six management tactics often hypothesized to affect groundfish. These tactics are: the use of harvest control rules with estimated biological reference points; seasonal closures; marine reserves; bycatch constraints; individual quotas (i.e., 'catch shares'); and gear type. Despite the high commercial value of many groundfish and consequent incentives for maintaining stocks at their most productive levels, most stocks were managed extremely conservatively, with current exploitation rates at only 40% of management targets and biomass 33% above target biomass on average. Catches rarely exceeded TACs but on occasion were far below TACs (mean catch:TAC ratio of 57%); approximately $150 million of potential landed value was foregone annually by underutilizing TACs. The use of individual quotas, marine reserves, and harvest control rules with estimated limit reference points had little overall effect on stock status. More valuable fisheries were maintained closer to management targets and were less variable over time than stocks with lower catches or ex-vessel prices. Together these results suggest there is no single effective management measure for meeting conservation objectives; if scientifically established quotas are set and enforced, a variety of means can be used to ensure that exploitation rates and biomass levels are near to or more conservative than management targets.","Melychuk, Michael C.;Banobi, Jeanette A.;Hilborn, Ray",WASHU-R-13-017,WSG-TA 13-14,R/COCC/SS-1,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Effects of management tactics on meeting conservation objectives for western North American groundfish fisheries,"""PLoS ONE,"" 8(2):e56684, 2013.",10.1371/journal​.pone.0056684,NA,NA,NA,NA

Banning discarding (whether under a TAC or IVQ) created the biggest increase in profit regardless of species overlap as it moves the target species biomass toward Bmey. MPAs reduced the profit in most cases and were not always successful at conserving the unproductive stock above a target size.

Algal oil recovery and quality are impacted by both biological (algal cell type, growth physiology) and technical (recovery and extraction methodologies) constraints. Unfortunately, and unlike other well-​established food and oil commodities, presently no universal reference standard exists for use in the algal oil industry. Results: A laboratory-​optimized strain of Chrysochromulin​a sp. is proposed as a natural matrix reference standard for algal fatty acid analysis. The alga is amenable to this purpose because: (a) as a soft-bodied organism, it is susceptible to many disruption and fatty acid extraction techniques; (b) it has a high fatty acid content (~40% dry weight); (c) the growth response and lipid profiles of this organism are highly reproducible; (d) unlike many algae that have limited fatty acid distributions, Chrysochromulin​a sp. cells contain a broad representation of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids ranging from C:14 to C:22. As a proof of concept, Chrysochromulin​a sp. was used as a reference standard for comparing 20 taxonomically diverse algal cultures, grown under identical physiological conditions and analyzed for fatty acid content using a micro-GC/MS analytical technique. Conclusions: Expanding efforts in both commercial and research facilities will require the screening and monitoring of candidate algal strains for lipid synthesis.

Many authors suggest that tidal plume fronts increase energy flow to fish-eating predators by attracting planktivorous fishes to feed on plankton aggregated by the fronts. However, few studies of plume fronts directly examine piscivorous predator response to plume fronts. Our work examined densities of piscivorous seabirds relative to the plume region and plume fronts of the Columbia River, USA. Common murres (Uria aalge) and sooty shearwaters (Puffinus griseus) composed 83% of all birds detected on mesoscale surveys of the Washington and Oregon coasts (June 2003-2006), and 91.3% of all birds detected on fine scale surveys of the plume region less than 40 km from the river mouth (May 2003 and 2006). Mesoscale comparisons showed consistently more predators in the central plume area compared to the surrounding marine area (murres: 10.1-21.5 vs. 3.4-8.2 birds km−2; shearwaters: 24.2-75.1 vs. 11.8-25.9 birds km−2). Fine scale comparisons showed that murre density in 2003 and shearwater density in both 2003 and 2006 were significantly elevated in the tidal plume region composed of the most recently discharged river water. Murres tended to be more abundant on the north face of the plume. In May 2003, more murres and shearwaters were found within 3 km of the front on any given transect, although maximum bird density was not necessarily found in the same location as the front itself. Predator density on a given transect was not correlated with frontal strength in either year. The high bird densities we observed associated with the tidal plume demonstrate that the turbid Columbia River plume does not necessarily provide fish with refuge from visual predators. Bird predation in the plume region may therefore impact early marine survival of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), which must migrate through the tidal plume and plume front to enter the ocean. Because murres and shearwaters eat primarily planktivorous fish such as the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), aggregation of these birds in the plume supports the hypothesis that it is the plume region as a whole, and not just the plume fronts, which enhances trophic transfer to piscivorous predators via planktivorous fishes.","Zamon, Jeannette E.;Phillips, Elizabeth M.;Guy, Troy J.",WASHU-R-13-023,WSG-TA 13-23,A/FP-7,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Marine bird aggregations associated with the tidally-driven plume and plume fronts of the Columbia River,"""Deep-Sea Research II,"" published online, doi: 10.1016/j.dsr2.​2013.03.031i, 2013.",10.1016/j.dsr2.​2013.03.031i,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our data revealed 2, 10, and 28 differentially expressed miRNAs in a dose−resp​onse manner corresponding to three increasing Cu concentrations. Numerous deregulated miRNAs were involved in neurogenesis (e.g., let-7, miR-7a, miR-128, and miR-138), indicating a role for Cu-mediated toxicity via interference with neurogenesis processes. Putative gene targets of deregulated miRNAs were identified when interrogating our previously published microarray database, including those involved in cell growth and proliferation, cell death, and cell morphology. Moreover, several miRNAs (e.g., miR-203a, miR-199*, miR-16a, miR-16c, and miR-25) may contribute to decreased mRNA levels of their host genes involved in olfactory signal transduction pathways and other critical neurological processes via a post-​transcriptional mechanism. Our findings provide novel insight into the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of metal-induced neurotoxicity of the fish olfactory system and identify novel miRNA biomarkers of metal exposures.","Wang, Lu;Bammler, Theo K.;Beyer, Richard P.;Gallagher, Evan P.",WASHU-R-13-024,WSG-TA 13-25,A/FP-7,reprints (peer-reviewed),2013,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Copper-induced deregulation of microRNA expression in the zebrafish olfactory system,"Environmental Science and Technology, 47(13):7466-​7474, 2013",10.1021/es40061,NA,Author's 19 page manuscript available electronically with this record,NA,NA

Extant salmonids are diploid, but occasional pairing between homeologous chromosomes exists in males. The consequences of re-​diploidization can be characterized by mapping the position of duplicated loci in such species. Linkage maps are also a valuable tool for genome-wide applications such as genome-wide association studies, quantitative trait loci mapping or genome scans. Here, we investigated chromosomal evolution in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) after genome duplication by mapping 7146 restriction-​site associated DNA loci in gynogenetic haploid, gynogenetic diploid, and diploid crosses. In the process, we developed a reference database of restriction-​site associated DNA loci for Chinook salmon comprising 48528 non-duplicated loci and 6409 known duplicated loci, which will facilitate locus identification and data sharing. We created a very dense linkage map anchored to all 34 chromosomes for the species, and all arms were identified through centromere mapping. The map positions of 799 duplicated loci revealed that homeologous pairs have diverged at different rates following whole genome duplication, and that degree of differentiation along arms was variable. Many of the homeologous pairs with high numbers of duplicated markers appear conserved with other salmon species, suggesting that retention of conserved homeologous pairing in some arms preceded species divergence. As chromosome arms are highly conserved across species, the major resources developed for Chinook salmon in this study are also relevant for other related species.","Brieuc, Marine S.

The ecological significance of algal and seagrass wrack subsidies has been well-documented for exposed-coast sandy beaches but is relatively unstudied in lower-energy and mixed-sediment beaches. In the nearshore ecotone where beaches are fringed with riparian vegetation, the potential for reciprocal subsidies between marine and terrestrial ecosystems exists. Human modification also occurs within this ecotone, particularly in the form of armoring structures for bank stabilization that physically disrupt the connectivity between ecosystems. I conducted detailed surveys of beach physical parameters, wrack and log accumulations, and supralittoral invertebrates in spring and fall over 3 years at 29 armored-​unarmored beach pairs, and behavioral observations of juvenile salmon (Oncorhcynchus spp.) and birds at 6 pairs in Puget Sound, WA, USA. Armoring lowered the elevation of the interface between marine and terrestrial ecosystems and narrowed the width of the intertidal transition zone. Armored beaches had substantially less wrack overall and a lower proportion of terrestrial plant material in the wrack, while marine riparian zones (especially trees overhanging the beach) were an important source of wrack to unarmored beaches. Armored beaches also had far fewer logs in this transition zone. Invertebrate assemblages were significantly different between armored and unarmored beaches. Unarmored invertebrate assemblages were characterized by talitrid amphipods and adult and larval dipteran and coleopteran insects (flies and beetles, including some types that have been shown to contribute to juvenile salmon diets in other studies) and correlated with the amount of beach wrack and logs, the proportion of terrestrial material in wrack, and the maximum elevation of the beach. Shoreline type (armored or unarmored) influenced juvenile salmon distribution, however their feeding rates were relatively high at all sites, thus decreased prey availability (i.e. fewer marine riparian and/or wrack-​associated insects) or altered prey resources are likely the most detrimental effects of armoring on these fish in the nearshore ecotone. Terrestrial birds, particularly Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) were commonly observed foraging among beach wrack and logs at unarmored beaches, but were largely absent from armored beaches. Based on my results, I developed a conceptual model summarizing marine-​terrestrial connections across the nearshore ecotone and the disruptive effects of armoring. This study demonstrates that shoreline armoring disrupts marine-​terrestrial connectivity, affecting the amount and type of organic material delivered to the nearshore ecotone in the form of wrack and logs, the abundance and taxonomic composition of supralittoral invertebrates, and the distribution and behavior of secondary consumers (juvenile salmon and birds). The results of my dissertation provide new information on relationships between physical and biological variables in the nearshore ecotone and connections between marine and terrestrial ecosystems that may be useful in informing conservation, restoration, and management actions.","Heerhartz, Sarah M.",WASHU-Y-13-001,WSG-TH 13-03,R/OCEH-2,theses/disserta​tions,2013,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Shoreline armoring disrupts marine-​terrestrial connectivity across the nearshore ecotone,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent re-emergence of vibriosis in economically valuable shellfish, such as the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) in Washington State, has increased the urgency to understand the ecology of this pathogen. It is currently unknown how predicted environmental changes associated with ocean acidification, such as elevated surface seawater temperature, increased partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), and Vt abundance, will impact marine organismal health and disease susceptibility. This study investigates how environmental cues predicted with ocean acidification influence physiological changes and pathogenicity in Vt. Using laboratory experiments to manipulate temperature and pCO2, we examined how these environmental factors influenced pathogen growth. Larval susceptibility to vibriosis was determined by exposing C. gigas larvae to a combination of elevated pCO2 and Vt concentrations. These experiments provide insight into the environmental parameters that may drive pathogenicity or influence proliferation of the bacterium. Investigation of single and multivariate parameters such as temperature, pCO2, and pathogen levels will help assess how predicted shifts in ocean conditions can impact shellfish survival and disease resistance.","Dorfmeier, Elene M.",WASHU-Y-12-004,WSG-TH 13-05,OCEH-4,theses/disserta​tions,2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,Ocean acidification and disease: How will a changing climate impact Vibrio tubiashii growth and pathogenicity to Pacific oyster larvae?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The organisms that inhabit these waters will have to cope with changing environmental conditions through the appropriate modulation of physiological processes. Calcifying organisms are particularly at risk, as increased atmospheric levels of CO2 in the atmosphere increase the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the oceans. Increased pCO2 reduces the saturation of carbonate minerals required to form calcified structures. Being able to cope with the increased energetic demand of maintaining these structures, in addition to other vital physiological processes, will be the key driver that determines which organisms will persist. Assessment of larval and juvenile Manila clam mortality and physiology in this study suggests that this species is capable of coping with elevated pCO2 conditions. The use of high throughput sequencing and RNA sequence analysis in larval clams revealed several physiological processes that play important roles in the Manila clam's ability to tolerate elevated pCO2 conditions during this life stage. Exposure of juvenile Manila clams, acclimated to elevated pCO2 conditions, to a thermal stress revealed that this species might also be capable of coping with multiple stressors associated with global climate change. Manila clams could therefore represent a model for studying physiological mechanisms associated with successful acclimation of populations to ocean acidification.","Metzger, David C.",WASHU-Y-12-005,WSG-TH 13-06,OCEH-4,theses/disserta​tions,2012,NA,Washington Sea Grant,"Characterizing the effects of ocean acidification in larval and juvenile Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, using a transcriptomic approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous surveys of this estuary complex had been conducted using a variety of methods, including manual measurements of bathymetry using a Real Time Kinematic-​Differential GPS (RTK-DGPS) system. These surveys were time-consuming, and generated relatively few data for the time invested. In addition, the survey methodology introduced unquantifiable uncertainty into bathymetric measurements due to the difficulty of ""feeling"" the soft substrate of the estuary. As a result, there was an interest in applying acoustic technology to collect soundings in the estuary to both increase the density of data collected and improve confidence associated with measurements.

Most outer coast populations had limited establishment success, persisting as either small or geographically constrained populations. Because of the potential risk the invasive crab posed to coastal resources, it was designated a deleterious species in Washington State, placing strict constraints on possession and transport of the species and giving the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife authority to monitor and control the crabs. The Salish Sea appeared to be green crab-free until Fisheries and Oceans Canada staff discovered a thriving population in 2012 in Sooke Inlet near Victoria, British Columbia.

To better understand the genetic complement that drives the metabolic processes of these organisms, we present the assembly and comparative pangenomic analysis of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes from Nannochloropsis salina CCMP1776. Results: The chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of N. salina are 98.4% and 97% identical to their counterparts in Nannochloropsis gaditana. Comparison of the Nannochloropsis pangenome to other algae within and outside of the same phyla revealed regions of significant genetic divergence in key genes that encode proteins needed for regulation of branched chain amino synthesis (acetohydroxyac​id synthase), carbon fixation (RuBisCO activase),energ​y conservation (ATP synthase), protein synthesis and homeostasis (Clp protease, ribosome). Conclusions: Many organellar gene modifications in Nannochloropsis are unique and deviate from conserved orthologs found across the tree of life. Implementation of secondary and tertiary structure prediction was crucial to functionally characterize many proteins and therefore should be implemented in automated annotation pipelines. The exceptional similarity of the N. salina and N. gaditana organellar genomes suggests that N. gaditana be reclassified as a strain of N. salina.","Starkenburg, Shawn R.;Kwon, Kyungyoon J.;Jha, Ramesh K.;McKay, Cedar;Jacobs, Michael;Chertkov, Olga;Twary, Scott;Rocap, Gabrielle;Cattolico, Rose Ann",WASHU-R-14-004,WSG-TA 14-01,A/FP-7,reprints (peer-reviewed),2014,BioMed Central,Washington Sea Grant,A pangenomic analysis of the Nannochloropsis organellar genomes reveals novel genetic variations in key metabolic genes,"BMC Genomics, 15:(212) 1-21, 2014",NA,NA,Open Access,NA,NA

However, M is rarely constant in reality as a result of the combined impacts of exploitation history, predation, environmental factors, and physiological trade-offs. Misspecificatio​n or poor estimation of M can lead to bias in quantities estimated using stock assessment methods, potentially resulting in biased estimates of fishery reference points and catch limits, with the magnitude of bias being influenced by life history and trends in fishing mortality. Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate the ability of statistical age-structured population models to estimate spawning-stock biomass, fishing mortality, and total allowable catch when the trueMwas age-invariant, but time-varying. Configurations of the stock assessment method, implemented in Stock Synthesis, included a single age- and time-​invariantMparam​eter, specified at one of the three levels (high, medium, and low) or an estimatedM. The min–max (i.e. most robust) approach to specifying M when it is thought to vary across time was to estimate M.

A series of four experiments revealed habitat-​specific mortality of young clams to be the dominant driver of distributions for both species. In contrast, settlement, which occurred over an extended reproductive period (June–Sept), appeared insensitive to substrate modification through additions of rock or shell (Expt 1–3). In Expt 2 and 3, sampled afterwinterwhen clams had reached ~1 cm shell length, densities were lower in soft sediments characterizingm​uch of the bay, and higher with rock or shell addition, especially with mesh bag protection. In Expt 4, which involved a crossed design of vegetation removal and substrate addition, one-year-old R. philippinarum densities increased with substrate addition more often than M. arenaria, and neither changed in response to removal of vegetation alone. In the case of one substratum, round rock, both vegetation removal and substrate addition were required to raise clam densities. Netting and gravel addition are standard practices in clam aquaculture to protect plantings of larger clams (e.g. N1 cm), but in our study substrate modification reduced losses of smaller (b1 mm) newly-settled clams. Overall, top-down control appears to be more important than settlement choice in determining local densities of Willapa Bay's non-native clams.

We executed a literature search to determine if reviewed studies support the contention that Z. japonica harms native species and habitats in Washington State and other locations in the Pacific Northwest region of the eastern Pacific Ocean. We found that studies designed to quantitatively assess Z. japonica's impact are limited but provide a summary that suggests Z. japonica increases overall diversity of infaunal invertebrates, while decreasing large infaunal species, such as Manilla clam and ghost shrimp, and the native seagrass, Zostera marina.

The report identifies opportunities to modify this program and analyzes whether a guidance document would better target shoreline protection. Two examples of county-specific programs, in King and Whatcom counties, have been evaluated to determine barriers to implementation and potential opportunities for modifications in order to use the program as an incentive for residential shoreline homeowners to either refrain from installing or remove bulkheads or armoring on their property. The report identifies opportunities to modify county-specific Public Benefit Rating Systems and provides draft language for further discussion. Finally, the report includes a brief review of additional incentives that could be “bundled” with the tax incentive to ensure the properties enrolled permanently restrict bulkheads on site.

A range of approaches, ranging from simple (e.g., geometric) to complex (e.g., process based) predictive models, have been developed to quantify overtopping and foredune retreat during storms. At present, however, there is no widely accepted approach for assessing the vulnerability of coastal foredunes to erosion and overtopping hazards. Because different coastal regions have distinct storm and geomorphic characteristics​, models need to be assessed and possibly adapted before they can be successfully applied to each unique region. In this study we apply a total water level (TWL) model and three simple foredune erosion models and assess their suitability for U.S. West Coast vulnerability analyses. The erosion models include a geometric model, an equilibrium profile model, and a wave impact model. We discuss the assumptions required to implement each model and force them with hydrodynamic conditions associated with a large-scale laboratory dune erosion experiment and a major winter storm approximately equivalent to the 30 year return period (TWL) event in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The models are each applied with beach and foredune characteristics extracted from airborne topographic LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data collected along the coasts of Oregon and Washington. Sensitivity tests reveal distinct differences in model dependence on beach slope, a critical parameter in determining storm water level elevations and ultimately the extent of foredune retreat. Without detailed, reliable field observations of storm-induced dune erosion from the region, the accuracy of each model is determined using results of the dune erosion experiment. Estimates of both overtopping and erosion extent are normalized by foredune dimensions, enabling comparisons of relative vulnerability between different reaches of coast.","Mull, Jeremy;Ruggiero, Peter",ORESU-R-14-014,ORESU-R-14-014,R/CNH-16,reprints (peer-reviewed),2014,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,Estimating storm-induced dune erosion and overtopping along U.S. West Coast beaches,"Journal of Coastal Research, 30(6), 1173–1187, November 2014.",10.2112/JCOASTR​ES-​D-​13-​00178.1,NA,NA,NA,NA
/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-wa-csv/9506979_1394_2818431.csv,110,"Estuaries represent the confluence of land and ocean environments and encompass a number of complex interactions amongst tides, winds, offshore waves and the riverine contributions, all of which contribute to total water levels (TWLs). The study of TWLs and the relative weight of its components can assist local communities in mitigating inundation events as well as drive a deeper understanding of potential impacts on ecological processes. Accurate predictions of surge and TWLs benefit from both deterministic and probabilistic methods. This thesis presents two manuscripts which examine wave and surge behavior within a representative Pacific Northwest estuary, Tillamook Bay, for a pair of fundamentally distinct research objectives: a singular, extreme storm event and a long-term climatological impacts study. Both manuscripts utilize a two-way coupled tidal circulation and nearshore wave transformation model (ADCIRC-SWAN) to simulate wave and surge behavior within Tillamook Bay. The first manuscript details a storm hindcast of the Great Coastal Gale of 2007, a series of extra-tropical cyclones which impacted the Washington and Oregon coasts in December 2007. Wind and pressure data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset were used to reproduce meteorological conditions. Non-tidal residuals were extracted at a number of locations of interest, including the tide gauge station, southern Tillamook, the jettied inlet and on open coast, in order to compare and contrast the relative influence of major physical processes to surge levels. From the suite of ADCIRC-SWAN parametric runs, it was found that offshore wave breaking produced an appreciable surge within the bay, even though wave heights quickly attenuate beyond the inlet. Meteorological forcing was the primary generator of complex circulation patterns and a surge in the northern portion of the bay. The model captures the max NTR at the peak of the storm but lacks skill in reproducing non-linear tide-surge interaction. The second manuscript examines changes in inundation patterns within the domain between historical and future climate conditions. Coupled ADCIRC-SWAN is run for two multi-decadal ranges from 1979-1998 and 2041-2060. Relative sea level rise is implemented by adding in 80 cm of water depth. Climate data from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) is used to drive offshore wave modeling, streamflow modeling and the coupled circulation-​wave model. Statistical bias correction of climate variables using NARR as a 'target' is performed first before forcing models. Wave information at the offshore boundary are derived from a regional WAVEWATCH-III hindcast and forecast, while riverine inputs are calculated using the MicroMet and HydroFlow runoff routing model.","Cheng, Tiffany K.",ORESU-Y-14-004,ORESU-Y-14-004,R/CNH-25,theses/disserta​tions,2014,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,"Coupled wave and surge modeling of Tillamook Bay, Oregon: Extreme events and climate change impacts",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
/Users/thalassa/github/nsgl/itemRecords-wa-csv/9508331_1393_2818430.csv,7,"Streams and rivers are major exporters of C and other dissolved materials from watersheds to coastal waters. In streams and rivers, substantial amounts of terrigenous organic C is metabolized and degassed as CO2 to the atmosphere. A long-term evaluation of CO2 dynamics in streams is essential for understanding factors controlling CO2 dynamics in streams in response to changes in climate and land-use. Long-term changes in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) were computed in the Anacostia River and the lower Potomac River in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Long-term estimates were made using routine monitoring data of pH, total alkalinity, and dissolved nutrients from 1985 to 2006 at 14 stations. Longitudinal variability in pCO(2) dynamics was also investigated along these rivers downstream of the urban Washington D.C. metropolitan area. Both rivers were supersaturated with CO2 with respect to atmospheric CO2 levels (392 mu atm) and the highly urbanized Anacostia waters (202-9694 mu atm) were more supersaturated than the Potomac waters (557-3800 mu atm). Long-term variability in pCO(2) values may be due to changes in river metabolism and organic matter and nutrient loadings. Both rivers exchange significant amounts of CO2 with the atmosphere (i.e., Anacostia at 0.2-72 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and Potomac at 0.12-24 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), implying that waterways receiving organic matter and nutrient subsidies from urbanized landscapes have the potential to increase river metabolism and atmospheric CO2 fluxes along the freshwater-​estuarine continuum.","Prasad, M.

The occurrence of oxygen depletion and mortality of organisms with limited mobility is well established along the Oregon coast (2002, 2006 hypoxia events), but the extent of the effect on juvenile organisms is not well quantified. Oregon estuaries and nearshore environments are critical nursery grounds for several commercially and ecologically important fish and invertebrate assemblages. When protracted hypoxic conditions occur in these habitats, juveniles may be incapable of seeking areas of higher oxygen, like more mobile and hypoxia-​tolerant adults. Our project seeks to identify and model the cumulative effects of temperature and dissolved oxygen patterns on the growth of recently settled English sole Parophrys vetulus. We conducted three experiments with a range of temperatures (5 – 15°C) and dissolved oxygen parameters (1.5 – 8.0 ml/l) that may be experienced in Oregon nursery habitats. We hypothesized that the interactive effects of DO and temperature would be clearly identifiable: poor growth during warm T/low DO, optimal growth during warm T/high DO; reduced growth during all cold T/DO conditions. Results indicate that there was a T/DO interaction when comparing the first two experiments with similar temperatures. When compared separately however, only DO appeared to have an effect on the overall growth. During the third experiment, we increased the range of temperatures to a higher and lower extreme, and only found an effect of temperature on growth. Furthermore, we will model growth as an indicator of habitat quality. Our team is working to create a predictive model of post-settlement habitat quality that may be used to compare the experimental data to field measurements.","Bancroft, Morgan;Ciannelli, Lorenzo;Ryer, Clifford",ORESU-WR-14-009,ORESU-WR-14-009,R/ECO-25,reprints (not peer-reviewed),2014,NA,Oregon Sea Grant,Hypoxia x temperature: juvenile English sole growth in simulated coastal and estuarine nursery environments (presentation),"9th International Flatfish Symposium, Cle Elum, Washington, November 12, 2014",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
